Myron Joshua grew up on Chocolate Milk with the gurgling of his mother's Folgers being percolated in the background. At age 18 while living on a Kibbutz in Israel he learned to drink "cafe botz" (Cooked turkish coffee) in the communal dining hall before going to the fields at 5:30 am. From then it was 30 years of instant coffee (no sugar, no milk) until someone poured him a cup of brewed Sumatran. Now he grinds his own beans before going to work at his office in Kibbutz Kfar Etzion.
