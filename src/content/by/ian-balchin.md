I have owned and ran Fables Bookshop in Grahamstown, South Africa, for 20 years now. I do try to ensure that we have reasonable coffee for the staff and not just the lowest grade of instant on the supermarket shelf, sometimes my efforts are even appreciated!

I enjoy some computer programming in Perl which frequently causes excessive coffee consumption to concentrate my efforts. I look forward to improving my home brew by roasting my own beans some time.
