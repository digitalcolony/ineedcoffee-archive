A former Air Force fighter pilot, Matt has lived and drank coffee all over the US and abroad. He ended up in Alaska, finally finding a home where he can pursue his love for family, the outdoors, and flying all in the same place. Now flying for a major airline, Matt spends his off time hiking, climbing, and being out-fished by his wife.
