Todd Zapoli loves to read and draw comics. He loves coffee too. Put all that together and the result are his coffee themed comics: Inanimate Objects and Life is Coffee.

You can view hundreds of Todd's Inanimate Objects comics on INeedCoffee.com, archived since 2002.

In 2017, Todd started Life is Coffee, a spin-off of Inanimate Objects here on INeedCoffee and in some newspapers and magazines.
