I am a coffee planter in Siddapur Coorg INDIA. The name of our Coffee estate is Providence (PAIS Estate) which is next to the Dhubhare Forest. I also work for the Oil & Gas Industry as a Maintenance & Asset integrity Manager for an Australian Company in Brisbane. I was inspired by seeing the work done by Dr Anand Titus Pereira and Geeta N Pereira. My intention is to protect Coffee cultivation for the growth of our environment globally.
