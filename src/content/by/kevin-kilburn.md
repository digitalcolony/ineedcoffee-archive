Kevin is in the US Army and enjoys various coffees from around the world. While in Naples, Italy working for NATO, he discovered real Italian espresso and ended up buying several mokas and a La Pavoni professional lever-type espresso machine. He's also visited Turkey, Spain, Macedonia, and Belgium and enjoyed the local coffees there. He also worked with some German soldiers and frequently enjoyed morning coffee with them. Most recently, he went to school with an Egyptian soldier who brought coffee into class. They often brewed it in a cezve (Turkish coffee pot) before class. A great way to start the morning.
