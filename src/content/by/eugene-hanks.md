Eugene Hanks studies Radiology and hopes to X-Ray you some day. He divides his time between studying and the internet by tinkering with his motorcycles and DIY'er projects. He is a coffee phile and continually strives to improve his knowledge and enjoyment of the noble coffee bean. If one never tries then one never will succeed.
