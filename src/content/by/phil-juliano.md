Phil Juliano is a cartoonist in his free time. His alter ego, P.J., can be found wrestling with his dog's disapproval of his coffee addiction online. Look for new strips every week on Monday, Wednesday and Friday! His comic has been printed in newspapers and magazines around the country and he and Spencer will be a case study in awesome pet relationships in the upcoming book by Lisa Wogan titled "Dog Park Wisdom".
