Kevin Gilhooly lives in Dallas, Texas and is slightly addicted to coffee. He has progressed from instant to drip to grinding his own beans, and has now started home roasting. He is trying to convince his wife that cultivating coffee plants in the back yard would be a good idea, so he can control the entire production cycle.
