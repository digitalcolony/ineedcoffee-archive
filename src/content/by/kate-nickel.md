Kate is cooking from a top secret location in Seattle where she has access to fantastic local produce from markets and farms. She became interested in cooking without certain ingredients after uncovering some food allergies and the nutritional philosophies of Weston Price and the Paleolithic diet. All recipes on Cooking Kate's Blog avoid soy, dairy, corn, gluten, peanuts, cashews, macadamias, or pistachios. Kate channels her love of cooking and science background into creating/finding healthier foods.
