You do not want a *Keurig Coffee Maker*. Is making coffee really that hard? I don’t think so. If you are considering buying a *Keurig Coffee Maker*, please read this article. I have faith in you, and I think you can handle a simple coffee brewing method that will yield a much better-tasting cup of coffee.

With the brewing method alternatives described below, you won’t be using stale pod coffee. You can seek out whatever coffee you want and grind those beans before brewing. You will discover that your coffee’s quality will be much better. A *Keurig* is probably an acceptable option for the lobby of a tire store but for your kitchen? No. You can do much better.

Here are three ways to make a single cup of coffee that are better than the Keurig.

### #1 Porcelain filter (aka Dripper)

Put ground coffee into a paper filter. Set the filter in the ceramic holder over a mug. Pour hot water and wait. This coffee brewing style is straightforward and has a much smaller footprint than the Keurig. It is also much cheaper, at less than $20. Several different shapes and colors are available for this coffee brewing style.
