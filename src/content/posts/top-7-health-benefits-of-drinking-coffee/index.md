Are you trying to cut back on coffee for fear it might damage your health? Well, you’ll be pleased to hear that coffee has many health benefits. There may be no need to give it up – in fact, you might be able to start drinking more. See below for our top 7 benefits of drinking coffee.

### #1 Excellent source of antioxidants

Did you know that coffee contains more antioxidants than green tea and cocoa? According to scientific research, around 1,000 antioxidants have been found in unprocessed coffee beans \[1\], and it is believed that even more develop during the roasting process. If you want to target free radicals, drinking coffee is one way to do it.

### #2 Good for the heart

A Dutch study found that moderate coffee drinkers (those who consume two to four cups a day) have a 20% lower risk of heart disease than heavy coffee drinkers, light coffee drinkers, and non-coffee drinkers. The study analyzed the data from more than 37,000 over thirteen years to get the results \[2\].

There is some evidence that coffee is good for the heart, as it protects against arterial damage caused by inflammation. One reason to suggest it promotes good heart health is that it contains chlorogenic acid, an important antioxidant that fights against cardiovascular disease.

### #3 Helps to prevent depression

Numerous studies have linked coffee with lower rates of depression in both men and women. Results found that heavy coffee drinkers had the lowest risk of getting depression \[3\]. Whilst researchers aren’t sure how coffee curbs depression, it is thought to have to do with the fact that caffeine activates neurotransmitters in the brain, which are responsible for controlling mood.

### #4 Your Liver Loves it

Coffee consumption has been linked to lowering the risk of liver cancer and cirrhosis, particularly alcoholic cirrhosis. A study in the Archives of Internal Medicine \[4\] showed a correlation between increased coffee consumption and decreased risk of cirrhosis.

### #5 Lower risk of getting cancer

According to several studies, men who drink coffee could be at a lower risk of developing aggressive prostate cancer. Research from the Harvard School of Public Health has also suggested that drinking four or more cups of coffee daily will decrease the risk of endometrial cancer in women by up to 25% \[5\]. In addition to this, researchers have found a link between regular coffee drinking and lower rates of liver, colon, breast, and rectal cancers. Again, it is thought to be related to the antioxidants in coffee.

### #6 Good for the brain

Coffee is said to temporarily boost brain activity and give short-term memory boosts. Studies have also suggested that it could help prevent cognitive decline associated with diseases like Alzheimer’s and Dementia.

A Finnish study found that drinking three to five cups of coffee daily at midlife age could result in a 65% decreased risk of Alzheimer’s and dementia later in life \[6\]. Some believe this is down to the caffeine in coffee, which prevents the build-up of beta-amyloid plaque, something that could contribute to Alzheimer’s disease.

### #7 Lessens the risk of Type 2 Diabetes

A number of different research projects have suggested that coffee drinking is linked to a reduced risk of Type 2 Diabetes. In 2009, a study found that the risk of developing Type 2 Diabetes dropped by 7% for each daily cup of coffee \[7\]. Other studies have found that heavy coffee drinkers (those who consume more than four cups a day) had a 50% lower risk of developing Type 2 Diabetes.

Scientists believe that drinking coffee prevents Diabetes by helping the body use insulin and ensuring the effective regulation of blood sugar. It is also thought to prevent tissue damage and battle inflammation.

Although you may be drinking coffee for pleasure, it’s great to know that it has so many health benefits, too!
