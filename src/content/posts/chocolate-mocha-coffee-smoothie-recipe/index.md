This is a breakfast smoothie recipe that is perfect for us coffee fans.

-   1 scoop vanilla or chocolate protein powder

*Use fresh or frozen blueberries.*

### Directions

I used a countertop blender for this recipe. Add everything into the mason jar and blend for those with an immersion blender.

1.  Combine all dry ingredients in a flexible cup (and set it aside) so that you can add them to the hole in the top of the blender.
2.  Add ice cubes and blueberries to the blender.
3.  Add coffee
4.  Turn on the blender, and after the ice and blueberries are blended, slowly add the powders through the top hole in the blender.
5.  When all is blended, stop and add to a mason jar. Enjoy!

This is a healthy breakfast shakeâ€¦protein, some carbs from fruit, very healthy fatsâ€¦oh, and a HIT of caffeine! ðŸ™‚
