Tiramisu is the premier dessert at coffee houses. This recipe will help you make your own at home.

![tiramisu finished](tiramisu-finished1.jpg)  
*Espresso Tiramisu*

Ingredients: (Makes enough for 16 people)

-   12 shots of espresso
-   5 shots of Chocolate liqueur (ex: Godiva brand)
-   1/2 shot of Rum
-   2 shots of coffee liqueur (ex: Kahlua brand)
-   6 eggs
-   48 ladyfingers (usually two packages)
-   16 oz. of mascarpone cheese (usually two packages)
-   6 oz powdered chocolate
-   1/2 cup of bittersweet chocolate chips
-   2 tablespoons of milk
-   Whipped cream in a can for garnish

This recipe makes a **huge amount of tiramisu**: probably enough for 16 if they exercise portion control. (But good luck with that once they taste this stuff!) If you aren’t making this for an event or large gathering, you can half the recipe and probably be just fine.

*Tiramisu Ingredients*

### Step-by-step

Make the Liquid Mixture

Pull the shots of coffee, add the rum, coffee liqueur, and three shots of chocolate liqueur. Save two shots of the chocolate liqueur for later. Set the liquids over to the side.

### Make the Mascarpone Filling

Separate the egg yolks from the egg whites. The egg yolks should be mixed with the remaining chocolate liqueur and the sugar. Put the egg yolks in a pan that can be placed on top of another to create a “water bath” effect. The lower pan should be filled with water brought to a rolling boil. Constantly stir the egg yolk/chocolate liqueur mixture while it is heated. Heat for about three minutes until the mixture is light and bubbly.

Take the mixture off the heat and immediately mix it with the mascarpone. Use an electric mixer to blend thoroughly.

*Beat Egg Whites*

In a separate bowl, beat the egg whites until they are at stiff peaks.

Fold the egg whites into the mascarpone mixture.

### Chocolate Drizzle

In a small glass bowl, pour in most of the chocolate chips (save some for a garnish). Add the milk and microwave for about one minute until melted. Stir and set to the side.

Begin the layering process:

Dunk the ladyfingers in the liquid mixture one at a time, ensuring that each receives an equal amount of liquid. Layer them along the bottom of the trifle bowl. Spread approximately half of the filling on top of the ladyfingers. Sprinkle powdered chocolate over this, then drizzle the liquid chocolate over this. Repeat for the second layer.

### Refrigerate

Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 12 hours.

### Final touches

You can garnish with whipped cream and chocolate chips. You may also want to cut up the tiramisu and garnish each plate separately.
