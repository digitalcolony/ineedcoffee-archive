Humble store-bought pound cake slathered with a coffee-infused custard sauce turned out to be the base for a recent elegant dessert. A former work colleague rolls into town periodically, so dealing with time constraints, the sauce was constructed to give the dessert some sophistication. Homemade pound cake, long proven as a base for a wedding cake, is preferred for this task. Unfortunately, there was no time to spare before our guest’s whirlwind visit. Thankfully, a store-bought cake worked as a satisfactory base, and no one was aware of the shortcut taken.

The origin of the recipe is questionable, recently I found a similar one on Epicurious.com. I had the recipe for this sauce cut and pasted onto a 3×5″ card. The card was undated, bearing only a brief note stating the sauce was delicious and would have been yummy eaten alone. Definitely a tempting thought! Choose your coffee carefully to achieve the flavor you want, then make this yummy coffee treat to express your own personal taste. Enjoy!

3.  Return mixture to the same saucepan.

7.  Stir in ground coffee beans.
