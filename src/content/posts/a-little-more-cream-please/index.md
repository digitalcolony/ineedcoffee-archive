### Make Mine A Double Espresso

A single dose of this liquid may  
not be for me,  
Especially when the day is what  
I’m trying to see.

To get me through the day with  
an extra lift,  
And to get me past the noontime  
and another shift.

This Double Espresso is what the  
doctor order too,  
When you have an extra workload  
looking at you.

Times change and people change  
their flavor,  
It’s all in the ease of work not in  
the labor.

So “Make Mine A Double Espresso,”  
to put me back on track,  
And when I want an extra jolt  
I just drink mine black.

### Get the Coffee Perking, Before Working

A Morning Without Coffee, what we  
say is give us more!  
Because we want a cup of coffee before  
we go out the door.

It will take us up to break time and  
then on beside,  
For it boost our moral and takes us  
for an aroma ride.

The aroma of coffee is not like any  
other thing around,  
As we search for a cup of coffee or  
two even all over town.

We sit in the cafes and coffeehouses  
not to be without it oh no!  
For we will have you pass the pot of  
coffee on our break before we go.

To go back to work with a cup of coffee  
on our desk,  
Will be what we need when we look at  
all the mess.

Now we have everything under control  
before the day gets into a hectic flow,  
We want our morning coffee and will  
tell you that’s the most we know.

### Coffee to Go

Running, racing  
and geared for  
success but not

Let it sit for a

Once the taste

To drink a cup of

### Coffee Nut

Call me what you want for I can  
stand the test,  
Just get for me a flavor that I  
like the best.

Pour it in my favorite cup it then  
matters not to me,  
For I just love coffee even you  
can really see.

You see that I cherish a cup of  
coffee on today,  
For it gives me the lift as I’m  
merrily on my way.

Be it nine o’clock in the morning  
or the evening at five,  
You would think I needed coffee  
to keep me alive!

It’s just a desire that came to me  
many years ago,  
And a good cup of coffee my  
taste buds do know!
