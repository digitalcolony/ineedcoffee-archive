### 10 AM

The shackles on my soul Are slipping  
Time has taken its toll  
Slowly Stretching, I donâ€™t remember  
How long ago it was spring  
In the dark Basement Of my mind  
How long have I been here Immobile, and blind, without  
Light Or fresh air?  
And how long Have you stood there,  
Pouring coffee  
For me?

*Pour Coffee*

### Snooze Button

Each morning, your eyes open slowly like small suns on the horizon of my day.  
Coffee brews on auto; waking the cat who comes to meow her indignation.  
You reach for me with nested warmth from beneath the covers to pull me back to you,  
And I am happy as the world goes away, if only for a few minutes more.
