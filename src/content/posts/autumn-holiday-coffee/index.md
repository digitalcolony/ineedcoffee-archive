*Autumn-Holiday Coffee*

### Directions

1.  Brew a pot of your favorite coffee, a little too strong.
2.  In a small pan, add 1.5 cups of water, 4-7 cloves, 1/2 inch cinnamon bark broken up, 4-7 whole cardamom -split the tips, and 1-3 teaspoons of sugar.
3.  Heat up to a boiling point for 3-4 minutes.
4.  Mix the coffee and the spice mix.
5.  Pour into cups, top with whipped cream, and sprinkle with chocolate and cinnamon.
6.  Add more sugar if desired.

This also makes a great drink with some Tia Maria or Mozart-liqueurs for a more adult evening drink.
