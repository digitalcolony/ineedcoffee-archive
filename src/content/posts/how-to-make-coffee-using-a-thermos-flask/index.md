There are various methods for creating a tasty cup of coffee and I was always looking for a cost-effective method, where the process is simplified with not many dramas involved.

As a young boy, I used to see my mother prepare this lovely cup of coffee at home every single morning, with not much effort, and I used to wonder how. I would watch the coffee come out of a Thermos flask every morning into a stainless steel cup, and my mother used to present this coffee every morning. I was not very curious to know more about it as long as I got my coffee.

This process continued for a long period until I grew to become a young man. Then one day I again came across this process in our family home. I learned that this coffee brewing method was an old PAIS family process method practiced for ages.

The golden moments were finally established, my curiosity vanished and I came to know how this lovely coffee was made. The process was very simple. Roasted coffee beans were ground to a powder and placed into a Thermos or other hot water storage flask. Hot water was added and then the flask was sealed, where the brewing would take place initially and remain hot.

Let’s make some Thermos coffee.

### #1 Grind Coffee

Place one tablespoon of coarsely ground coffee powder for a cup of coffee you wish to make. I normally powder grind my coffee beans using a mortar and pestle.

### #2 Add Ground Coffee to Thermos

Place the ground coffee into the hot water storage flask.

### #3 Fill Thermos with Hot Water

Add hot water off the boil to the flask and immediately close the lid. Preferably, do this process at night before you sleep so the coffee is ready in the morning.

### #4 Wait a Few Hours and then Flip the Thermos

After waiting a few hours (or overnight), turn the flask upside down 180 degrees. Do this a few times gently (around 3-5 times) and then return it back to its normal position.

The coffee brewing happens only instantly when the hot water is mixed with the coffee grounds, which prevents the coffee from over-extracting and tasting too strongly. If however, you discover the taste is too strong, you can reduce the amount of ground coffee added to your flask on the next brew.

Wait thirty additional minutes for the coffee grounds to settle down.

### #5 Open the Thermos and Serve

Open the flask lid. You are now ready to pour the aromatic coffee into a cup. By allowing 30 minutes for the grounds to settle, you will have a clean cup of coffee. If however, you are getting grinds, you can pour the coffee over a paper filter before serving.

A good hot water storage flask will retain enough heat overnight for a hot cup of coffee. If your model cools too much, you can always heat up the coffee in a microwave.

Add milk and sugar as required.

The effortless method will give you sufficient time to do all your other activities every morning rather than bothering yourself with a lot of time to make that critical cup of coffee.
