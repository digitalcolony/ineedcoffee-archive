I immediately noticed the resemblance when I first saw the Cosori Pour Over Coffee Maker.

It looks a lot like a Chemex except that the brewer is set up to use a metal cone filter instead of a paper filter. Why would you use a metal filter instead of the thick Chemex paper filter? Three reasons come to mind. First, some prefer coffee that tastes richer with all the oils, like the French Press. Second, you’ll never accidentally run out of filters. And third, you’ll save money by not having to buy paper filters.

Look at the photo below. On the left is the Cosori and on the right is a Chemex. Separated at birth?

### Tutorial

This is usually the part of the article where we here at INeedCoffee put together a step-by-step guide on how to brew coffee with the brewer being discussed. But we don’t need to this time because the steps to brew pour-over coffee with the Cosori are basically the same as those for the Chemex, with the exception that you don’t have to fuss with a paper filter.

For guidance, see [Chemex Coffee Brewing—History and Tutorial](/chemex-coffee-brewing-history-and-tutorial/) or follow the instructions clearly written on the side of the Cosori box.

### Review

You would purchase the Cosori because you like the design and need a pour-over coffee maker capable of making a lot of coffee at once. If you are making coffee for yourself, getting any generic Pour Over Coffee Dripper Stainless Steel that brews directly into your cup would be a better option and take up less counter space.

However, if you like the design and you are the type of coffee drinker who wants the coffee with all the oils in a “Chemex-like” glass container, consider the Cosori. The glass is thick, and I like the handle as much as the handle on my Chemex. The clean-up is easy as well.

At the time of this writing, one costs under $30, whereas an 8-cup Chemex is closer to $50.

On a side note, the metal filter included in the Cosori also fits the Chemex. I don’t believe Cosori sells the metal filter separately. Still, others sell similar stainless steel metal cone filters that I’m sure you could drop into your Chemex if you wanted to try to make coffee like a Cosori.
