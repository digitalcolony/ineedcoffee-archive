The only thing better than coffee is chocolate, or is it the other way around? Either way, they are both fabulous and go great together. You could have a cup of hot coffee while enjoying a chocolate cake or mousse, but how about putting the two together? Hershey’s now makes a dark chocolate espresso bar to give you that extra boost of energy from caffeine and sugar. Coffee can add that touch of distinction to your favorite chocolate confection. One of my favorites is a super easy and fast Mocha Chip Cookie recipe.

Preheat Oven to 350 F

-   1 box Chocolate Cake Mix
-   2 Eggs
-   1/2 cup butter
-   2 oz. Espresso (or substitute)
-   1 cup Chocolate Covered Coffee Beans and/or Chocolate Chips

If you do not have the espresso, that’s fine. Use two slightly heaping teaspoonfuls of instant coffee and add enough warm water to make 2 oz. Put this in the refrigerator to cool to at least room temperature.

Mix all items on low just until mixed, and then add the chocolate chips or chocolate-covered coffee beans or some of both if you would like. Drop onto cookie sheets and bake at 350 F for about 12 minutes. If the cookies fall when you take them out, cook the next batch a couple of minutes longer.

This easy recipe also has some great variations. Leave out the espresso and add 1/2 cup of all-natural chunky peanut butter for a chocolate peanut butter cookie, or add some cinnamon to make a chocolate spice cookie. This is one of my favorite cookie recipes, and I hope you enjoy it, too!
