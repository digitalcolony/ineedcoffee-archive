I silently wait every morning, afternoon, and evening. It is so cold and dark in the mornings. Will she rise early today, or will she be late? I ask the same question every day.

You see my name is Java. I know this because I see the reflection of the writing on the front of me. I share all of her time, and I know she loves me. We awake together, read the paper, watch the news, and at times, I lay next to her in the evenings. She is unable to function without me. My friend Mr. Coffee howls each morning, to let her know it is time to rise. She rushes in and grabs me; I feel the warmth, the sweet smell, and the taste of cream and sugar. And when it is a good day, my cup runneth over.

I know that her love for me is real, that she will always defend me. I can still hear her say: “No, that’s my Java.” I am irreplaceable. And I will never let her down. There are moments when she is not able to spend a lot of time with me. Nevertheless, I will wait, until we meet again.

Just recently Mr. Coffee spewed some words to me, “You know, you’re not the important one here! It’s the java.”

“What do you mean ‘the java’? My name is “Java.”

Again hissing at me, “You dummy, the java is what she puts in you”.

But not even his words could dampen my spirit. I know that I am the important one! Without me, she could not enjoy this so-called java. For I am the java cup.

So another day begins with me!
