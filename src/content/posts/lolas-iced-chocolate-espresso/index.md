So here I am, back again with another syrup recipe, I have conjured up over the summer months. My love for coffee syrups has grown and grown, and so has my bank of recipes. Here is one that I thought you might enjoy.

This is a personal favorite for a mid-morning pick-me-up. My early mornings are spent in commuter traffic, horns non-stop and cars bumper to bumper. When I finally arrive at work, I am confronted with a large pile of posts to open and five tasks on my desk to be completed by lunchtime. So by the time 11 o’ clock strikes, I am first to the kitchen to make my creation. I don’t always remember the ice, but cold milk alone is better than no iced chocolate espresso at all.

Here is how to make my iced chocolate espresso:

### You will need:

-   1 or 2 shots of espresso (Depending on how strong you like it, I prefer 2)
-   Cold milk (Again, the amount depends on how milky you like your coffee)
-   Monin chocolate coffee syrup
-   Whipped cream
-   Chocolate dust/sprinkles
-   Ice

### Directions:

1.  Fill your glass with ice
2.  Add cold milk
3.  Stir in your shot/s of espresso and one teaspoon of chocolate syrup
4.  Top with whipped cream and chocolate dust/sprinkles

The beauty of this creation is that you can make the drink as strong or weak as you like. If you are a die-hard espresso fan, opt for more espresso shots and just a dash of milk. If you prefer your coffee weak, opt for more milk than coffee.

This is my latest coffee syrup addiction and is a perfect pick-me-up with a sweet kick. Since joining Cafe Rico in June I have created several recipes, which I like to share with my fellow coffee enthusiasts. I still love my cinnamon syrup iced coffee, but have been trying out new syrups regularly to spice things up. I decided I needed to make something with a bit of a kick to help me through the morning. Lots of Monin coffee syrups are available, including almond, amaretto, white chocolate, and mint.

I used to hate coffee until I started working for a wholesale coffee supplier and decided it was time to confront my coffee fears. If you like mochas, you’ll love my iced chocolate espresso. I haven’t looked back, but I will post more of my recipes soon!
