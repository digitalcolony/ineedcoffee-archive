Pancakes are popular and the most loved breakfast preparations for people of all age groups. These fluffy discs are a quick and easy food option that tastes great. But, having the same kind of flavorings day after day may make even fun food preparations, such as pancakes, boring and mundane too…

Adding a variety of toppings may add an element of surprise, but creating a variation in the pancake recipe sounds more, doesn’t it? And, how about combining the two most loved breakfast preparations in one? We are talking about coffee and pancakes.
