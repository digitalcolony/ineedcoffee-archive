### Origins

Coffee Jelly was invented after westerners introduced coffee to the Japanese. The Japanese people found new uses for the coffee plant, one of the best is coffee jelly. This fantastic combination of coffee and gelatin is served as dessert, or sometimes alongside liquid coffee. Individually, coffee and gelatin have wonderful health benefits. Combined together, coffee jelly is a nutritious snack or dessert.

### Health Benefits of Coffee

Studies have shown that drinking 2 to 5 cups of coffee daily can vastly improve your health. The natural caffeine in coffee contains serious health benefits. Coffee is good for:

-   Your Liver: Caffeine metabolizes in numerous ways that promote overall health.
-   Your Skin: Drinking three cups of coffee a day fights the most common form of skin cancer. In one study, women who drank three cups a day reduced their risk by 21%!
-   Your Brain: Aside from the short-term effects (better mood, more energy, sharper thinking), sustained coffee drinking has been shown to slow down the onset of Alzheimer’s.

A Few Tips:

-   Only drink organic coffee.
-   Don’t overdo it! Too much of a good thing has negative effects.
-   Listen to your body, and it will tell you how much coffee you need.
