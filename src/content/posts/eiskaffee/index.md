Eiskaffee is German for Ice Cream Coffee. It is darn simple to make, and really hard to screw up. It is great for hot weather, especially when you want coffee, but not hot coffee.

It is somewhat reminiscent of a root beer float, with a little less sweetness and calories. Best of all, it takes just a minute or two to make.

### Basic Ingredients

-   2-3 Scoops of vanilla ice cream
-   4-8 ounces of cold, double-strength instant or brewed coffee (or double espresso, hot should be OK)
-   Real whipped cream

### #1 Put your scoops of ice cream in the bottom of the glass
