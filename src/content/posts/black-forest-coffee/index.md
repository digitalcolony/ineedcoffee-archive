Discover the delicious fusion of black forest gateau and smooth golden coffee. This wonderful recipe is ideal for the end of a meal, or as a special treat. The taste is inspired by the traditional German dessert black forest gateau, with its layers of gorgeous chocolate and maraschino cherries. The coffee, cherries, and chocolate blend perfectly to create a drink that is luxurious.

Yet, this indulgent delight is not hard to make. If you follow the instructions carefully, a black forest coffee can be prepared in very little time.

### What Will I Need?

Here is a list of the basic ingredients you will need to serve up to eight cups of black forest coffee:

![press pot coffee](press-pot-coffee1.jpg)  
*Black Forest Coffee*

-   1000ml / 35fl oz coffee
-   4 tablespoons chocolate syrup
-   200g maraschino cherries (or 50g + 4 tablespoons maraschino cherry juice)
-   Whipped cream
-   Chocolate sprinkles

Tip: Don’t be afraid of experimenting slightly. For example, adding cherry brandy will give your recipe a kick – perfect for a dinner party.

### Directions

Before you begin, make sure you have enough hot coffee for you and your guests. (This recipe works best with freshly ground coffee.)

**Step 1:** If using a French press (as in these illustrations), first crush 150g of maraschino cherries, removing stones as you go.

**Step 2:** Brew your favourite coffee using your preferred method (we recommend a French press).

**Step 3:** Mix coffee and syrup. Wait a few seconds and then, if using a French press, add the cherries. It is important to add the cherries last; this is so you don’t impair the delicate flavouring. Press the filter down now, removing the coffee grounds and cherry solids from the drink. If you’re not using a French press, simply add cherry juice.
