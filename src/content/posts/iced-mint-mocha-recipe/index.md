So here is something a little different from my wonderful selection of coffee syrup recipes. This is a refreshing beverage, perfect for a hot day or if you fancy something a little different from your average cup of coffee. I discovered this fantastic creation after buying some chocolate mint syrup and delving into my freezer to find some ice cream to complement the syrup nicely. A bit of ice, a blender, and an espresso coffee maker, together with the usual milk and coffee, and the Iced Mint Mocha was born.

Here is what you need to make the Iced Mint Mocha:

-   Plenty of ice
-   1 teaspoon of Monin mint chocolate coffee syrup
-   2 scoops of mint choc chip ice cream
-   1 or 2 espresso shots
-   Cold milk
-   Whipped cream
-   Chocolate dust/sprinkles

You will also need a blender and, ideally, an espresso maker for this creation.

### Directions

1.  Put a handful of ice into a blender
2.  Add two scoops of mint choc chip ice cream
3.  Add one teaspoon of chocolate mint-flavoured coffee syrup
4.  Pour in a preferred amount of cold milk (depending on how thick you want it) and 1-2 shots of espresso (depending on how strong you like it)
5.  Blend for one minute
6.  Pour into a glass and top with whipped cream and chocolate dust/sprinkles or a drizzle of chocolate mint syrup.

The Iced Mint Mocha is now my favourite. The refreshing mint and the sweet chocolate make this iced coffee espresso drink a light combo. This is also good as a sundae-style dessert, just add less milk so the mixture is really thick, and then top with whipped cream, chocolate sprinkles, and a drizzle of chocolate mint syrup.

Coffee syrups are available in a variety of flavours including almond, hazelnut, vanilla, and white chocolate. My coffee syrup addiction has continued ever since I started working for a coffee supplier, and Iâ€™m not willing to go cold turkey until I have created as many inspiring recipes as possible.
