A few months ago, the article “Senseo Coffee Brewing” was released. In the brewing tutorial, I concluded that the machine produced very weak and bitter coffee. Since then, I’ve received numerous emails about the Senseo brewing system. Here are some of the questions received in the last few months.

### Do you recommend the Senseo?

Typically, INeedCoffee avoids reviews. We would prefer to stick to tutorials and tips. However, I felt this was a case where we couldn’t hide the truth. The truth is that the Senseo makes dreadful coffee. The machine does a disservice to coffee. I knew Senseo was doing a massive advertising blitz, so INeedCoffee couldn’t stay silent.

### Can the bitterness be avoided by using two pods?

Using two pods will not correct the bitterness; it will only correct the weakness. For the Senseo to produce a cup of coffee that isn’t bitter, a quality third-party roaster will have to surface that offers fresh Senseo-friendly pods.

### Have you tried any of the 3rd party pods?

No. I unloaded my Senseo on the used market shortly before the article was released. I’d advise others to do the same before the price collapses after the holidays. I guess that eBay and Amazon Marketplace will be flooded with these machines in January.

### Where can you buy replacement pods?

Amazon.com sells the Senseo pods.

### What do you think of the Keurig or Flavia brewing systems?

I have never tried either. If the Keurig or Flavia people would like a brewing tutorial written on INeedCoffee, they are more than happy to ship me a unit. Of course, they run the risk that if it performs as poorly as the Senseo, our readers will find out. Or they (or one of their distributors) could send us a brewing tutorial with photos (free of marketing spin) that also covers machine maintenance.

### I like the Senseo.

Good for you.

### Can you make your own pods?

In the article, I did a quick hack using scissors and my own home-roasted coffee. It was just a quick hack. For a more detailed step-by-step tutorial, read [Make Your Own Coffee Pods](http://ineedcoffee.com/make-your-own-coffee-pods/) by John Wolf.

### Did the Senseo produce foam as it shows in the commercial?

The *foamy effect* is something that looks good, but I’m not sure if it’s good. Crema in espresso is good, crema in brewed coffee means the beans didn’t make contact with the water at that point, usually due to extreme freshness. The Senseo is neither brewing method and the coffee was beyond stale, but it did produce a foamy effect.

### Thank you. I almost bought one of these machines at Costco.

You’re welcome.

### Final thoughts?

It’s obvious that Senseo was developed for the LAZY coffee drinker that piles in so much cream and sugar that anything short of motor oil would taste acceptable. If you LIKE the taste of coffee, consider another brewing system. If you want something quick and easy, it’s still hard to beat the auto-drip machine with a timer.

**December 2005 UPDATE**

I’ve received many positive emails regarding the Ecopad refillable Coffeepod Senseo permanent filter. Although messy, this refillable filter allows users to take control of their coffee. If you own a Senseo this may be worth a look.
