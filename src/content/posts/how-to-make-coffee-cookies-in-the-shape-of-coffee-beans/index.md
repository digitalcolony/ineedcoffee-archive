### Coffee Cookies Anytime

These cookies are conceived for a typical Italian breakfast, but you can taste them at all times of the day, for a sweet break that will boost your energy, thanks to a little bit of caffeine. Moreover, this recipe is really fast and relatively easy to make, so it is suitable for everybody and could give great satisfaction to novice cooks too! Just take care of removing your cookies from the oven at the right time, in order to let them cool outside and allow them to keep their fragrant texture. You can store them in a tightly closed glass jar (also a tin box would do), which shall be kept far from direct sunlight and heat. This way, your cookies will last for an entire week.
