Making great coffee at home is something that should be easy and inexpensive. With the right equipment and our [Coffee Brewing Guide](/coffee-brewing-guide/), it is. In this article, I’d like to introduce the items on the list and match them with brewing tutorials here on INeedCoffee.

### French Press

Which French Press you pick is up to you. The important thing is to have one. French Press coffee is about as simple as it gets. Grind the coffee coarse, add water off a boil, wait 3-4 minutes, plunge, and pour. It is one of the easiest ways to make an excellent cup of coffee. For more purchase guidance check out [Buying a French Press – Picking The Right One](/buying-a-french-press-picking-the-right-one/).

### Aeropress Coffee

At less than $30, the Aeropress makes an amazing cup of coffee.

### The Chemex

This classic pour-over coffee brewer just requires a custom-sized filter and some hot water. If you are moving away from a plastic drip coffee brewer, this may be the ideal brewer for you. It has a cleaner taste than the French Press. Just be sure to rinse the paper filter before brewing.

### Electric Variable Temperature Kettle with Gooseneck

Throw out your old kettles. They are too slow. Life is much sweeter when the water you heat for coffee happens quickly. The variable temperature is a great feature if you also brew tea with a wide variance of optimal temperatures. The gooseneck spot allows for a more precise, even water flow for pour-over coffee brewing methods.

### Drip Coffee Maker with Thermal Carafe

Drip coffee makers have advanced greatly in recent years. They now brew at higher temperatures, have a more even extraction, and brew directly into a thermal carafe. The days of having a glass coffee pot cook on a warming plate for hours are over. The Bonavita, Behmor Brazen, and Technivorm are three of the best new-wave drip coffee brewers.

### Bean Grinders

The importance of grinding your coffee cannot be understated. It is the single most important thing you can do to improve your coffee quality. Below are two grinders. The Cuisinart is my _ghetto_ pick. It is cheap and extremely loud, but it works if you are on a very low budget. People in the industry have told me that The Virtuoso is the best non-espresso coffee grinder on the market. You’ll need something better for espresso, like the Rancilio Rocky Grinder. With grinders, you get what you pay for.

### Specialized Coffee Brewers

The Clever Coffee brewer is gaining popularity as an excellent way to make a single cup of coffee. Place the filter with the ground coffee into the brewer. Add hot water. Wait a few minutes and then place the brewer on your mug. This will open the bottom part of the brewer, allowing the coffee to be brewed directly into your mug.

The Clever is as rich as the French Press but without any sediment.

The Bialetti Stovetop Espresso Maker is used to make Cuban coffee. The Ibrik is used for Turkish Coffee, and for Vietnamese Coffee, you will need a coffee filter set.
