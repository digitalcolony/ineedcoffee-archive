Cincinnati, Ohio, is a city proud of its chili heritage. According to local tradition, Cincinnati chili is uniquely spiced with cinnamon and chocolate, served on pasta, and covered with pillowy cheddar cheese, onions, and beans. It is a favorite, delicious indulgence for Cincinnatians.

We made an improvement to the original by adding ground coffee.
