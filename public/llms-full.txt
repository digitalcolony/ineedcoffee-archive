## ☕ INeedCoffee Archived INeedCoffee is now an archive. INeedCoffee is wrapping up after over 25 years online, with its full archive remaining available. Launched in April 1999, INeedCoffee has spent over two decades celebrating coffee culture—from home brewing techniques to the rich history of coffee itself. Over the years, it became a gathering place for coffee enthusiasts to share knowledge, tips, and experiences. As of May 2025, INeedCoffee will no longer publish new content. However, the full archive will remain online—for coffee lovers new and old to enjoy. All 631 articles written by 166 contributors. Thank you to everyone who visited, contributed, and shared a cup with us—virtually or otherwise. Your enthusiasm made this site what it was.![INeedCoffee Logo](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/ineedcoffee-smile.jpg) Michael Allen Smith Founder, INeedCoffee

# The 5 Best Coffee Websites (2018) [Coffee Business](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/coffee-business/)---by [Michael Allen Smith](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/michael-allen-smith/)![The 5 Best Coffee Websites (2018)](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/5-best-coffee-websites/5-best-coffee-websites.jpg) It has been 21 years since I published my first coffee website. Before INeedCoffee launched in April 1999, I had a website that reviewed the coffee shops in Tampa Bay. I left that area in 1998, and that website is now gone. Since then, I’ve seen numerous coffee websites start and quit. Today, I don’t follow many coffee sites as they don’t further my knowledge or love of the beverage, but there are still a few that I consider excellent. ### The Dirty Secret About Many Best of Coffee Site Lists Before I get into my top 5 coffee sites, I want to share with the reader a dirty secret about these lists that you may not know. Often, sites are contacted in advance of the list being published. The person writing the list will ask the site for a promise to link back to the list should they make it onto the list. Your site won’t get on the list if you don’t promise. These lists are often hack jobs written by people with little experience in coffee or even reading coffee websites. They are created to get a link back to their site, which improves their rankings in search engines. They never disclose this fact when they publish their best-of lists, either. So, in the spirit of full disclosure, here are my top five coffee sites. I didn’t reach out to any of the top five, and they likely won’t share this link because they already know they are doing an awesome job. ### Perfect Daily Grind [Perfect Daily Grind](https://perfectdailygrind.com/) is a coffee education site that bridges the gap between the coffee enthusiast and the coffee professional. Its articles on every aspect of coffee are well-researched. Also, as someone who is learning Spanish, I enjoy reading its Español section.![Perfect Daily Grind](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/perfect-daily-grind.DGBWLcSf_1NtNvA.webp)_Perfect Daily Grind_### CoffeeGeek I often get asked my opinion on a particular grinder or espresso machine by someone looking to make a major purchase. I always recommend going to [CoffeeGeek](https://coffeegeek.com/) to complete their research. CoffeeGeek has detailed reviews and forums with many other coffee geeks to help you decide which coffee equipment is best for you.![espresso shot pilot ](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/espresso-photo-coffeegeek.BrloXnuw_Z1RDzlP.webp)_In addition to extensive coffee equipment reviews, Mark from CoffeeGeek has a Flickr channel full of outstanding coffee photos. This photo is titled [Building yet another Americano](https://www.flickr.com/photos/coffeegeek/34911337954/)._### Instagram Wait, Instagram isn’t a coffee site. That is true, but Instagram is the social network that is doing the best job of connecting coffee drinkers with coffee professionals. With Instagram, you can follow your favorite coffee shops and roasters. From there, you might add a few baristas. Soon, a network of coffee information will be available to you, one photo at a time. I learn more about what is happening in specialty coffee on Instagram than anywhere else. Many coffee professionals have left Facebook because their messages were not reaching the people who liked their page, and Twitter has become too noisy. These reasons have made Instagram an ideal tool for coffee professionals to share information with their fans. The only downside is that the website allows you to view only images. You will need the mobile app to post your photos.![instagram screenshot](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/instagram-screenshot.Bo9eVGIQ_1LNcLc.webp)_Photo courtesy of Instagram_### The Coffee Compass This site dives deeper into some of the current events in coffee. So the next time the Huffington Post or some other non-coffee news outlet attempts to cover a coffee story, check to see if [The Coffee Compass](https://www.thecoffeecompass.com/) has written anything on the topic. I’d rather read my coffee news from coffee professionals. The Coffee Compass is also doing an outstanding job covering regional coffee scenes. ### INeedCoffee Of course, I’m going to give my site props. 🙂 We are committed to coffee education. Our audience is people looking to make better coffee. We have numerous coffee brewing tutorials that are always being updated. INeedCoffee doesn’t post as frequently as other coffee sites, and that is by design. We don’t want to bombard our readers with noise.![INeedCoffee comic logo](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/ineedcoffee-3-200.DkQxiPRC_ZJq6Q0.webp) ### Many More Great Coffee Websites There are more great sites related to coffee that specialize in different areas. As my coffee journey continues, I will find more favorites. As for now, I consider these five to be the best coffee websites._In 2018, Perfect Daily Grind was added to the list. Sprudge fell off the list, as they now hide the year on their posts, which makes it hard to tell how current their cafe information is._ Published on July 18, 2018--- #### Michael Allen Smith Michael Allen Smith is both a coffee fanatic and a web developer. In April 1999, he combined these two interests and started the coffee website INeedCoffee.com.

# 5 Coffee News Stories That I Never Want To Read About Ever Again [Cafe Culture](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/cafe-culture/)---by [Michael Allen Smith](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/michael-allen-smith/)![5 Coffee News Stories That I Never Want To Read About Ever Again](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/5-coffee-news-stories-that-i-never-want-to-read-about-ever-again/clover-coffee-board1.jpg) Time for a little rant. People have been sending me links to coffee news stories for as long as I can remember. They know me as the publisher of _INeedCoffee_, and they believe they’ve stumbled upon some coffee news item that has escaped my radar. Most of the time, I’m not only aware of the news item, but it is something I couldn’t care less about. For this article, I’ve decided to list the five coffee news stories that I will NEVER read about again. Here they are. ### #1 Coffee Health Cheerleading Stories I plan on doing a full article on this topic, but I’ll keep it brief for now. I drink coffee because I like the taste. It often makes me feel great, and I enjoy the social aspect. If there are positive health benefits, that doesn’t impact my behavior. I will still drink coffee. We all have unique responses to coffee and caffeine. Those responses vary wildly from person to person. Those responses change over time. We are all unique. Sharing links to some study that a majority of individuals in some group achieved a minor health benefit from consuming coffee is meaningless to a group ALREADY consuming coffee. Please don’t send me any stories that glamorize the health benefits of coffee. I won’t read them because they do nothing to improve my health. Remember, we are already drinking coffee. The only people who might benefit from these stories are people who love and can tolerate coffee but have stopped drinking it for fear it is damaging their health. That isn’t us, though. ### #2 Animals Pooping Coffee Stop sending me links to stories about the latest animal that they have tricked into eating and pooping out coffee. Civet cats or birds or elephants or monkeys. I don’t care. It is old news. It may have been funny 10 years ago, but now there are [several reports of animal cruelty](https://sprudge.com/horrifying-animal-abuse-coffee-real-getting-worse-51697.html) related to civet cats and this process of coffee production. ### #3 Anything Starbucks is Up To At the time of this writing, the Starbucks Corporation is worth $40 Billion (USD). Even though they are massively wealthy, they have figured out how to get millions of dollars in free marketing. Every month or so, they send out a press release about something they are up to, and lazy reporters everywhere rearrange the words and publish it as “news”. Meanwhile, small independent coffee businesses with no marketing budgets doing far more innovative stuff with coffee can barely get a mention in their neighborhood blog. Several people have sent me the latest Starbucks “news” story about some $7 cup of coffee. Boring. In 2008, independent coffee shops charged between [$9 and $15 for a cup of Panama Esmeralda](https://ineedcoffee.com/the-2-best-cups-of-coffee-ive-ever-had/). Yeah, that is where independent coffee was four years ago. They sought the highest quality micro-lots and paid top dollar for those beans. Only for them, it wasn’t a marketing gimmick. Their mission was to push the envelope in terms of coffee quality, which they continue to do.![Trabant Clover board](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/clover-coffee-board1.60YGH2NE_Z2iI1Fo.webp)_My first Clover Coffee was at Seattle’s Trabant Coffee in May 2007. This was a full year before Starbucks purchased the company and even longer before they began deploying them into stores._ Please don’t send me any news items related to Starbucks*. When I look back at my coffee education, I consider them to be middle school at best. INeedCoffee exists to empower coffee drinkers to make better coffee at home. Tutorials on this site will teach you how to [brew](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/brewing-coffee/) and [roast](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/roasting-coffee/) coffee, which is superior to anything Starbucks can do._* This also extends to Tully’s, Dunkin Donuts, Mcdonald’s, or any other publicly traded corporation that sells coffee._### #4 Automated Single Coffee Brewers When did coffee become so difficult to make that we needed to fill our counters and break rooms with stale pod-based coffee brewers? Is making coffee really that hard or messy? May I never receive another email that mentions [Keurig](https://ineedcoffee.com/alternatives-to-using-a-keurig-coffee-maker/), [Senseo](https://ineedcoffee.com/senseo-coffee-brewing-revisited/), or whatever the latest mediocre pod-based coffee maker happens to be. These machines are the enemy of good coffee. They promote the belief that making coffee is hard and messy. It isn’t. ### #5 Any Coffee News Item Featured on the Homepage of Major News Outlets We live in a hyper-connected world. By the time a coffee news item hits the front page of major news outlets, there is more than a decent chance I have seen it or will soon. Recently, NPR did a coffee story. About seven people sent me links to the story within a few days. I think it was about some animal pooping out coffee (see #2). Before you share any news item with anyone, give them a little credit and assume they aren’t living under a rock. The best news items will always be the ones that are way under the radar. A fresh angle on coffee that hasn’t been reprinted everywhere will always be more interesting than headline coffee news. OK. Rant over. I feel better now.

# 11 Crazy Coffee Drinks You Won’t Find on a Starbucks Menu [Cafe Culture](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/cafe-culture/)---by [Alex Freemon](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/alex-freemon/)![11 Crazy Coffee Drinks You Won’t Find on a Starbucks Menu](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/11-crazy-coffee-drinks-you-wont-find-on-a-starbucks-menu/11-crazy-drinks.jpg) I don’t know about you but sometimes I feel myself getting into a coffee rut. I mean, you can only order so many half-caff, low-fat, no whipped cream macchiatos before you start to feel like you are missing out on things the greatest drink in the world can offer. Well, no more. Cultures around the world have developed an abundance of alternative ways to make (and drink) coffee, including everything from lemon juice to eggs to alcohol. So set your French press and V60 aside for a minute and learn about these crazy coffee drinks. ### #1 Turkish Coffee![turkish-coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/turkish-coffee.BCdBWpTo_Z2syKQz.webp)_[Turkish Coffee](https://flic.kr/p/9ZXQa4) by Quinn Dombrowski_ You have probably heard of, if not tried, this one. Turkish coffee is consumed all over the world, but it is the drink of choice in many parts of (you guessed it) Turkey, the Middle East, and Eastern Europe. It is a drink steeped in history, going back well over 400 years with the recipe changed very little. The preparation is relatively simple. You take water and sugar (recipe in the link below) and boil them together before adding a very fine mix of coffee and cardamom powder and reboiling. After boiling, let it sit briefly to foam before pouring it, grounds and all, into a small cup (think Italian espresso cup). You then sip slowly and enjoy. The slowly part is key here because if you do not, you learn the hard way what mouth full of coffee and cardamom powder tastes like.**Recipe:  [Preparing a Traditional Turkish Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/preparing-a-traditional-turkish-coffee/) (I Need Coffee)**### #2 Vietnamese Iced Coffee![Vietnamese Coffee Brewer](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/viet-brewing-setup.yXxdKS_0_ZitQRY.webp)_From [How to Brew Vietnamese Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/brew-vietnamese-coffee/)_ Next, we head over to Asia, where hot drinks have been commonplace for eons. Vietnamese coffee has gained popularity over recent years, so you have probably heard of it. It is immensely popular on the streets of Vietnam, and variations of it appear all over Southeast Asia. It is essentially a two-layer ice coffee with sweetened condensed milk as the base with black coffee in the middle and foam on top. It is traditionally served over ice and made using robusta beans (not my favorite) but using arabica and drinking it hot is just as enjoyable.**Recipe: [How to Brew Vietnamese Iced Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/brew-vietnamese-coffee/) (I Need Coffee)**### #3 Oliang (Thai Coffee)![thai-iced-coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/thai-iced-coffee.BM8-tywa_Z3SJ3Q.webp)_[Thai Iced Coffee](https://flic.kr/p/ap5CY3) by Chris Goldberg_ Now just a hop, skip, and a jump over to Thailand where we find Oliang or Thai iced-corn-soya bean-sesame coffee. Oliang is made by taking your coffee and additional ingredients blend (see recipe below), putting it into a [coffee sock](https://ineedcoffee.com/brewing-coffee-coffee-sock/), pouring boiling water through it, and letting it steep for ~10-15 minutes before adding sugar and pouring over ice. You then add sweetened condensed milk (how they do it on the streets of Bangkok), pop in a straw, and enjoy! If for some reason you are opposed to the sock method, you can simply steep the coffee blend in hot water for the same time and then filter it (it won’t be traditional though).**Recipe: [Thai Iced Coffee Recipe (Oliang)](https://www.templeofthai.com/recipes/iced_coffee_oliang.php) (Temple of Thai)**### #4 Yuan Yang (Coffee with Tea)![coffee-tea-pour](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/coffee-tea-pour.Bw-I5MBd_7iXVB.webp)_[Photo](https://flic.kr/p/dS63cn) by Petra Bensted_ Coffee? Tea? Why not some of both? Yuan yang is a favorite drink in Hong Kong; so much so that the Starbucks stores in Hong Kong actually had a limited-time offering of it as a Frappucino. Yuan Yang is made by making strong black tea in a pot, stirring in evaporated or sweetened condensed milk and coffee, then sweetening it to taste. Add some shortbread cookies and you have yourself an Asian twist on high tea.. ahem, coffee.**Recipe: [Hong Kong Yuan Yang Tea](http://www.food.com/recipe/hong-kong-yuan-yang-tea-496985) (Food.com)**### #5 Mazagran (Portuguese Lemon Coffee)![lemon-coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/lemon-coffee-650x425.FaV1tKpg_7UbRB.webp) Next, we head to Portugal, where they have found other unique takes on coffee, specifically adding lemon to it. Now, you may not think that coffee and lemon sound intuitive, but this iced drink can actually be incredibly refreshing. It is essentially a coffee lemonade made by mixing strong coffee with lemon juice and sugar to taste. You then pour it all over the ice, kick back, and enjoy your fresh take on lemonade.**Recipe: [Portuguese Coffee Lemonade (Mazagran / Capile)](https://www.cookingwithalia.com/247-coffee-lemonade-mazagran-capile-portuguese-recipe/) (Cooking with Alia)**### #6 Greek Frappé![greek-frappe](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/greek-frappe.DGKJkhhA_Z16dYUQ.webp)_Greek Frappé by Tilemahos Efthimiadis (photo removed from Flickr)_ Staying in Europe, another refreshing take on the world’s greatest drink, the renowned frappé, is especially loved throughout Greece. To make, add a small amount of cold water, instant coffee, and sugar to a jar or shaker and shake vigorously for 10-20 seconds or until it is incredibly foamy. You then pour the mixture over ice, add water and milk to taste, and voila, you have created a frappé!**Recipe: [Greek Frappe Recipe](https://ineedcoffee.com/greek-frappe-recipe/) (I Need Coffee)**### #7 Swedish Egg Coffee![swedish egg coffee ingredients](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/image06-650x433.DPZAvWhy_ZShTPO.webp)_Photo by [Alex Freemon](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/alex-freemon/)_ Now, we move to Scandinavia, where they have created a new take on coffee for breakfast. Popular in both Sweden and Norway, egg coffee is exactly what it sounds like. To make it, you mix a raw egg with coffee grounds and a small amount of water and mix it until it has the consistency of, well, an egg-coffee slurry. You then take the slurry, pour it into a pot of boiling water, mix, strain, and serve. The result is supposedly one of the smoothest and creamiest cups of coffee you will ever have; make sure you use good eggs though.**Recipe: [Swedish Egg Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/the-smoothest-cup-youll-ever-drink-swedish-egg-coffee/) (INeedCoffee)**### #8 Irish Coffee![irish-coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/irish-coffee1.Dqm70b2P_xFD02.webp)_Irish Coffee by [Chris Arnold](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/chris-arnold/)_  Alcohol and coffee, what else do you really need? Almost everyone has heard of, if not tried, an Irish coffee, though most people simply use Baileys rather than making the real thing. All you need for this bonafide beverage is your coffee of choice, Irish whiskey, brown sugar, and some whipped heavy cream (or just whipped cream from a can if you’re lazy). It makes an excellent after-dinner dessert drink, or, you know, something for breakfast.**Recipe: [The Best Irish Coffee in the World](https://ineedcoffee.com/the-best-irish-coffee-in-the-world/) (I Need Coffee)**### #9 Pharisäer (German Rum Coffee)![german-pharisaer-coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/german-pharisaer-coffee.CchpX_JM_1sxyIu.webp)_[Pharisäer](https://flic.kr/p/6XsvQa) by Agnes Chang_ Continuing our alcoholic trend, Pharisäer, or rum coffee. It is a decadent drink that originated in Germany but can really be enjoyed anywhere in the world. Similar to the Irish method, you simply take your favorite strong cup of coffee, add sugar and then add in a shot (or more) of rum before topping with whipped cream and a dusting of cocoa. Also, a good thing to remember is that you are not technically supposed to stir this drink once it is assembled, but rather sip it through the layer of whipped cream.**Recipe:  [Pharisees Coffee with Rum – Pharisaeer](https://www.thespruceeats.com/german-coffee-with-rum-recipe-1446818) (About.com)**### #10 Cafe de Olla (Mexican Coffee)![cafe-de-olla-coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/cafe-de-olla-coffee.Dc5kToqa_R8Jb7.webp)_Cafe de Olla by [Chris Arnold](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/chris-arnold/)_  Nearing the end of our trip is café de olla, or Mexican cinnamon coffee. While it does not contain alcohol, it is similar to Irish coffee or a pharisäer in that it is more of a dessert than a drink, but there is no shame in that. It is incredibly easy to make, you take water, coarse coffee, brown sugar, and a cinnamon stick and boil it all together. You then take it off the heat and let it infuse for about 10 minutes before straining and serving; you can optionally add whipped cream for extra richness. The cinnamon pairs excellently with the coffee and adds another depth of flavour, while the brown sugar adds decadence that plain white sugar lacks.**Recipe:  [How To Make Mexican Coffee (Cafe de Olla)](https://www.mrbreakfast.com/superdisplay.asp?recipeid=1644) (MrBreakfast.com)**### #11 Ethiopian Coffee Ceremony![ethiopia-coffee-ceremony](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/ethiopia-coffee-ceremony.xxVeIOip_Z1FtPQE.webp)_[Ethiopian Coffee Ceremony](https://flic.kr/p/4inn2W) by Matt Handy_ Last on our crazy list is more of a ritual than a type of drink, but bears an honorable mention. Similar to a tea ceremony in Japan, the coffee ceremony considers everything from the type of cups and pots used to the atmosphere of the environment. It is traditionally performed as a sign of friendship and welcoming and should never be turned down as it would be a great insult to the host. To begin, the woman (traditionally it is a female that performs it) will burn incense to ward away evil spirits and will continue to burn it throughout the ceremony. She will then set a jebena, or clay coffee pot, filled with water and place it over heat before taking green coffee beans and cleaning them over hot coals. After the heat removes the husk, the hostess will then proceed to roast the beans over the hot coals similar to how one might use the stove to make popcorn; she will typically roast the beans until they are medium to dark brown. The freshly roasted beans are then ground in a mortar and pestle and added to the jebena, where the entire mixture is brought to a boil before serving in handle-less cups. The entire process can take several hours and each part should be treated with reverence and respect. If you ever get the chance to attend a ceremony be sure to take advantage of the opportunity!**Ritual:  [Coffee Cultures: Eritrea and Ethiopia](https://ineedcoffee.com/coffee-cultures-eritrea-and-ethiopia/)  (I Need Coffee)**### Conclusion So there you have it: 11 unique and crazy ways to spice up coffee—not that it needs them.

# 5 Ways to Make Your Coffee Habit More Sustainable [Cafe Culture](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/cafe-culture/)---by [Daniel Foster](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/daniel-foster/)![5 Ways to Make Your Coffee Habit More Sustainable](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/5-ways-to-make-your-coffee-habit-more-sustainable/sustainable-coffee-habit.jpg) If you are looking for ideas on being more sustainable about your daily coffee habit, read on for five ideas. ### #1 Use a thermal coffee carafe Many drip coffee makers have warming plates designed to keep coffee warm for hours. What these plates really do is burn your coffee and burn your wallet. One Computer World writer said his warming plate consumes nearly 1,000 watts of electricity while powered on. These plates also overheat coffee and ruin the taste. Brew with a thermal coffee maker instead. Thermal carafes keep coffee warm for hours without the need to heat up. Your coffee and your energy bill will both be easier to digest, and metal carafes never break. ### #2 Try cold brew Cold brewing coffee could significantly cut down your energy usage. Devices such as the [Toddy](https://ineedcoffee.com/cold-brew-coffee-with-the-toddy-coffee-maker/) or even [coffee grounds mixed with water in a bottle](https://ineedcoffee.com/cold-brew-coffee-is-not-rocket-science/), you can substitute energy with time. Traditional coffee makers use heat energy to quickly brew coffee. With cold brew, you must wait 12-24 hours, depending on the method, to enjoy your coffee. You can brew at room temperature or in a refrigerator. Heating up the coffee in a microwave uses very little energy, and since cold brew requires a relatively coarse grind, electric grinder owners will use less energy (hand grinding is the way to go)![cold brew coffee - coffee sock - close lid](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/close-lid-jar.DhdqHh6F_2u8QVj.webp)_From the INeedCoffee tutorial, [Cold Brew Coffee is Not Rocket Science](https://ineedcoffee.com/cold-brew-coffee-is-not-rocket-science/)._### #3 Don’t forget about the birds! These days, birds have more than Windex to worry about. As our penchant for coffee grows, millions of acres of trees are being cut down to make way for plantations, destroying the habitats of many rare and endangered migratory birds. This affects ecosystems thousands of miles away from coffee-growing areas. Look for a retailer that stocks Bird-Friendly-certified coffee. These shade-grown beans have all the benefits of organic and shade-grown coffee, including better taste, but also support the Smithsonian Migratory Bird Center. The birds and other wildlife that depend on preserving tropical forests will thank you. Keep in mind that fair trade coffee isn’t necessarily organic (though most are), and organic coffee usually isn’t shade-grown unless otherwise specified. If you can’t find Bird Friendly coffee in your area, organic shade-grown coffee is your next best bet.![bird friendly coffee in India](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/bird-friendly-coffee-650x433.DhIGimLr_1Gscaa.webp)_Photo from the article [Ecofriendly Shade Coffee as Stopover Sites in Bird Migrations](https://ecofriendlycoffee.org/ecofriendly-cofriendly-shade-coffee-as-stopover-sites-in-bird-migrations/) by Dr. Anand Titus Pereira._### #4 Reuse Coffee Grounds Reuse coffee grounds to make the most of your purchase. And by reuse, I don’t mean put them back in the coffee maker. Coffee is an excellent fertilizer. Coffee grounds are rich in phosphorus and potassium. They also contain nitrogen and other trace minerals essential for plant health. Add some to your houseplants or throw them in the garden. You can also use coffee grounds to deodorize refrigerators as part of your beauty routine. Gently rub coffee against the skin to exfoliate. You can even dye your hair, albeit temporarily, with coffee! ### #5 Rethink single-serve coffee makers Single-serve coffee makers such as the Keurig line and Nespresso are certainly convenient. Yet the pods are clogging up landfills across the country. Coffee capsules are made of a combination of plastic, aluminum, and paper that can be recycled individually, but not as a single unit thrown in the trash can. Switch to a reusable coffee pod such as the Ekobrew for Keurig or the CoffeeDuck for Nespresso to be more sustainable. Your wallet and Mother Nature will thank you. If you’re in the market for a new coffee maker and single-serve is a must, look for a model that uses a flow-through water heater. These heaters warm up water only as needed and power down when coffee is not brewing, resulting in up to 50% energy savings. The Department of Energy recommends the Bosch Tassimo for its flow-through heater.![Discarded Colors by Thomas Guignard](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/capsules640.ba3bg2_-_qt06l.webp)_[Discarded Colors](https://www.flickr.com/photos/19614198@N00/2478359433) by Thomas Guignard_### Bonus Idea – Switch to Compostable Keurig K-Cups When this article was first published, Keurig K-Cup brewers did not have fully compostable options. Now they do.

# 20 Years of INeedCoffee [Coffee People](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/coffee-people/)---by [Michael Allen Smith](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/michael-allen-smith/)![20 Years of INeedCoffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/20-years-of-ineedcoffee/ineedcoffee-20-comic.jpg) Twenty years ago today, on April 4th, 1999, INeedCoffee.com went online with our first article. We are still here, still brewing, and still posting. ### History INeedCoffee was started while I was living in the Washington DC Metro. I had just moved there from Tampa Bay, where I had another website called the [Tampa Bay Coffee Guide](https://web.archive.org/web/19970610013528/http://www.cyberspy.com/~mas/Coffee/index.html) that reviewed local coffee shops. Once I moved to the DC area, I quickly learned that I could no longer update my old website, as this was still the age of dial-up modems, and connecting to my Tampa-based Internet Service Provider would have been a long-distance phone call. I wanted to start something new. I liked coffee and creating web pages, so on September 1, 1998, I registered the domain INeedCoffee.com. Over the years, I’ve both liked and disliked the name. At one point, I tried to change it to AllCoffee.net, but it didn’t stick, so I reversed course and stayed with INeedCoffee.![2000 INeedCoffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/2000-inc-650x546.B80Xxohe_Z109JjT.webp)_A screenshot from the original INeedCoffee design._  My team leader at work offered to host INeedCoffee from his home server for free. This turned out to be a bad decision, as it was often down and I could not connect to the server most of the time. Months were wasted on that setup until I moved the site to a legitimate web hosting company. Had I hired a real web host from the start, INeedCoffee would have had a 1998 birth date. Lesson learned. Since then, I’ve only used excellent web hosts. The first article went live on April 4th, 1999. [Coffee History Primer](https://ineedcoffee.com/coffee-history-primer/) was written by Ryan Jacobs. Ryan also taught me how to home roast coffee, which is as cool as it sounds, especially if you’ve never done it before. Home roasting became an important topic for several posts in the early years. In the first decade, INeedCoffee experimented with accepting content from many writers across many coffee-related topics. Some topics, such as brewing tutorials, home roasting, and comics, were popular, whereas fiction, poetry, and travel articles weren’t. We stopped publishing those topics. Our agriculture section grew so big that we spun off that content to [EcoFriendlyCoffee.org](https://ecofriendlycoffee.org/), which releases new content monthly. Over the years, we have increasingly focused on coffee education, which has turned out to be our niche. When INeedCoffee started, most Internet users used dial-up modems and had those terrible heavy CRT computer monitors. Pages were small and slow, so we had to keep our images small so they would load quickly. Today, that is no longer an issue. Having photo-rich tutorials helps us communicate better with our coffee-loving readers.![hearthware](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/hearthware1.CN3FXxd-_1xXDek.webp)_A photo of the Hearthware Precision roaster from 2000._ ![](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/iroast2-1st-crack.-9uHZbyS_Z1hzvq2.webp)_Hearthware I-Roast 2 photo taken by [Chris Arnold](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/chris-arnold/) in 2007_ In recent years, we’ve taken new photos for many older articles. It is something we continue to do from time to time. Today INeedCoffee is based out of Seattle, a legendary coffee market. Our website is secure (runs on HTTPS), mobile and tablet friendly, and uses a CDN (Content Delivery Network) to speed up the site, especially to readers outside of North America. We continue to publish a few articles each month. ### Lessons Over the last twenty years, I’ve seen many sites start and quit. I’ve also seen people who want to start a blog but never do. Here are a few tips. 1. Don’t wait for everything to be perfect before you launch. It never will be. Start with something plain and worry about making it pretty later. 2. You don’t need to buy a domain and hosting to see if blogging suits you. Go to [WordPress.com](https://wordpress.com/) and set up a free account. Later, you can transfer it to your domain, either with them or a third-party web host. 3. Once you know you want to blog and are committed, register a domain name and purchase web hosting. 4. When choosing a web host, find one that offers Let’s Encrypt, a free way to make your site secure (HTTPS). There are a few reasons you want your site to be secure. 5. Don’t focus on making money first. Focus on getting a valuable message to the reader. Do that enough times, and the traffic will come. Then, if you want, see if there is an opportunity to earn extra income. This is probably the primary reason people quit. They do it for money, and the money isn’t that much, so they lose their motivation and quit. INeedCoffee went the first 8 years without a single ad or affiliate program. 6. Make sure your site is fast and mobile-friendly. If you are looking for themes, search for _Responsive_ design. Most new sites are fine, but many older sites still have designs that look awful on smartphones. 7. Stay up to date with security patches and make regular backups. I know of one popular fitness site that lost everything. They didn’t patch their blog software or make any backups, and then they got hacked. 8. Don’t let your domain registration expire. INeedCoffee.com is usually registered out 5 to 10 years. I didn’t include any social media tips because I’m not very good at them, and the rules are changing constantly. ### Thank You All! I want to thank all our readers, contributors, and sponsors. Here is to another 20 years!

# 20 Amazing Facts about Coffee [Cafe Culture](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/cafe-culture/)---by [Ralph Buck](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/ralph-buck/)![20 Amazing Facts about Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/20-amazing-facts-about-coffee/20-amazing-facts-coffee.jpg) I can’t remember the last day I started without my daily cup of coffee. I stumble out of bed every morning and drag my body to my coffee maker, brew myself a cup, and then, only then do I feel alive enough to start my day. My love for coffee was so deep that I started thinking. I wanted to know everything that I could know about my favorite drink. And here are a few of the facts I found most amazing.![Honore de Balzac](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/balzac1.AKacO-TY_283DLR.webp)_Honore de Balzac_1. During Turkish wedding ceremonies, grooms were made to vow to always provide their brides with coffee. Failure to do so could result in divorce. 2. Beethoven (like me!) was such an ardent coffee lover that he’d count 60 beans per cup before making his brew. 3. The Boston Tea Party resulted in Americans switching from tea to coffee as an expression of freedom. 4. Did you know that coffee doesn’t just give us humans a buzz? No siree. BEES get a buzz when drinking coffee, and what’s even more interesting is that it supercharges their long-term memory! How else do you think they find their way back to the same plant over and over again? ([reference](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/130308-bees-caffeine-animal-behavior-science)) 5. Exfoliate your skin with moist coffee grounds at least twice a week, rinse, and watch your face glow. ([reference](https://www.sheknows.com/living/articles/956905/how-to-make-your-own-exfoliating-scrub-2/)) 6. French novelist and playwright Honore de Balzac supposedly consumed 50 cups of coffee a day to fuel his inspiration while writing. It’s scary to think that the lethal dose is about 100 cups of coffee. 7. Back in 1674, there was a mass uprising against coffee. In fact, the [‘Women’s Petition against Coffee’](https://ineedcoffee.com/the-coffee-house-a-history/) said that coffee was turning British men into ‘useless corpses’ and so a ban was demanded for those under the age of 60. 8. In 1511, coffee was banned in Mecca on the grounds of preventing free-thinking people from getting together to hang out. 9. Kopi Luwak, the world’s most expensive coffee is made from coffee beans eaten and excreted by a Sumatran wildcat. And at one time commanded a price of over $300 a pound! 10. During WWII, American soldiers ordered their espresso watered down because it was too strong for them. 11. In fact, the term “cup of Joe” comes from the American soldiers, also known as GI Joes of WWII, who loved their coffee and were big drinkers. 12. Coffee was declared illegal not once, not twice, but a whopping three times in three different cultures! The first was in Mecca in 1511, followed by Charles II in Europe in an attempt to quell the ongoing rebellion, and the third was by Frederick the Great in Germany in 1677, who was worried about the economic implications of money leaving the country to buy this beverage. 13. There has been an indication that coffee can actually be used to [fuel a car](https://ineedcoffee.com/chicken-john-coffee-achiever/). Not now, of course, but maybe someday in the future. Kind of reassuring, don’t you think, to imagine a world where one day we might never have to worry about running out of fuel? 14. In 1906, a Belgian man living in Guatemala by the name George Washington invented instant coffee. Not the first American president, but the first inventor of [instant coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/the-history-of-instant-coffee/). Not bad at all, if you ask me! 15. In ancient Arab culture, a woman could only divorce her husband if he didn’t like coffee enough. Talk about extreme love for coffee! 16. The word coffee originates from the Arabic word *‘*qahhwat _al-bun’_, which was then shortened to ‘qahwa’. The Turks called it ‘kahve’, after which the Dutch made it ‘koffie’, until it was finally translated to ‘coffee’ in English. 17. In the 17th century, there was great debate over whether or not Catholics could drink coffee. It was only after Pope Clement VII Okayed it that they were allowed to drink it. 18. We now drink coffee with our breakfast, but back in the 17th century people [drank beer](https://ineedcoffee.com/before-there-was-tea-there-was-coffee/) along with their breakfast every morning! 19. Teddy Roosevelt drank a gallon of coffee every day. (Not something you’d want to try today. Just putting it out there.) 20. Coffee was so scarce in Germany during WWII that ‘coffee bombs’ were dropped from planes to turn the people against the government.![Teddy Roosevelt](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/teddy-roosevelt.IC-hlxrr_1XqgvN.webp)_Teddy Roosevelt_ Published on April 4, 2022--- #### Ralph Buck Ralph Buck runs a cozy bistro in suburban North Carolina with his wife.

# 10 Reasons I Love Cold Brew Coffee [Brewing Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/brewing-coffee/)---by [Michael Allen Smith](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/michael-allen-smith/)![10 Reasons I Love Cold Brew Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/10-reasons-i-love-cold-brew-coffee/cold-brew-coffee-love.jpg) The first time I had cold-brew coffee, I didn’t like it at all. I used a Toddy with coffee that was ground too fine, and I didn’t know I was making a concentrate, so the coffee was much too strong. It would be years before I would try cold-brew coffee again. I’m so glad I did because I’ve become quite a fan. I now drink cold-brew coffee every day. The other day, I jotted down ten reasons I love cold brew coffee. Maybe an idea or two from this list will inspire you to make your own cold brew coffee. ### #1 Simple to Make Add cold water over ground coffee and let it sit for a day. Filter, and you are done. That is as simple as it gets. Anyone is capable of making great cold-brew coffee. INeedCoffee has some detailed tutorials customized to different brewers, but the steps are mostly the same. [Cold Brew Coffee is Not Rocket Science](https://ineedcoffee.com/cold-brew-coffee-is-not-rocket-science/) ### #2 Easy to Fix Coffee That is Too Weak or Too Strong With other brewing methods, if you mess up when brewing your coffee, there isn’t anything you can do but start over. With cold brew, you can fix your coffee. If you discover the coffee is too weak at the end of the brew cycle, you can extend the brew time. With some brewers such as the [Penguin](https://ineedcoffee.com/make-concentrated-cold-brew-coffee-with-the-penguin-coffee/), this will be as easy as removing the filter and returning it to the brewing chamber. If the coffee is too strong, that is fine, as you are usually making a concentrate. Just add water until you reach the coffee strength you prefer. Usually, it only takes one or two brew cycles to find your optimal level of grounds, water, and brewing time. For example, I’m currently filling my Penguin filter about 70% full of medium-coarse coffee. Then, I fill the brewer 100% full of water and brew for 24-30 hours. When complete, I cut the concentrate 50% with water. My roommate, who likes stronger coffee, cuts it 25% with water.![penguin cold brew](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/brewing-cold-brew.DwOPNgnH_Z12mVgk.webp) ### #3 Save Time, Perfect For Non-Morning People Having a quart of coffee concentrate in the refrigerator already made means I don’t need to spend time making coffee. I used to make an AeroPress first thing in the morning. I’d set the kettle, weigh the beans, grind the coffee, pour, stir, wait, and then press. Now, I just grab the pre-made cold brew. I’m a morning person, but I can see cold brew being a godsend for people who don’t have the energy to make coffee first thing in the morning. ### #4 Power Outages are Not a Problem This winter, we had a few power outages, one lasting 10 hours. During this time, I could not grind coffee or heat water, but it wasn’t a problem for me because I had a quart of cold brew already made. Not needing power also makes cold brew coffee a good candidate for camping and long road trips. ### #5 Old Coffee Works Great I learned this trick from a few coffee shops here in Seattle. They use old coffee that wasn’t sold for their cold brew. Cold brew is super forgiving. Coffee that is too old and stale for most brewing methods can be saved with cold brew. I’ve used medium to lightly roasted coffee, two months old, for a delicious cold brew. Using old coffee that I normally would have thrown out is great because it saves me money—less waste. ### #6 Cold Brew is Quiet If you live with others and wake up before them, pouring a glass of cold brew is far quieter than firing up a grinder and a kettle. Let everyone else sleep a little longer. If you are the first to rise, be ninja quiet with your coffee. ### #7 When you need “just a sip” Sometimes in the late afternoon, I want some coffee, but I also know it could interfere with sleep. With cold brew, I can grab “just a sip”. Other brewing methods are not ideal for anything less than a mug. This also makes cold brew ideal when you are detoxing from coffee. As you reduce your coffee intake below a mug, a sip or two of cold brew is a good idea to ward off any caffeine headaches. ### #8 Tastes Good Hot or Cold You do not need to drink cold brew cold. It tastes good when heated up. I heat my morning mug in the microwave. First, I do 55 seconds, followed by a stir, then 36 more seconds. This brings it to the perfect heat level without heating the coffee too much. Every microwave is different, so your times may vary. ### #9 Easy on the Stomach I had no issues drinking black coffee on an empty stomach for many years. Then early last year, I gradually started noticing minor pain and growling. I experimented with a few ideas, including Coffee Tamer mineral packs, decaf, and using half & half. In the end, cold brew worked best for me. Cold-brew coffee is known for having low acidity. For months now, I have been drinking cold-brew coffee on an empty stomach with no issues. ### #10 New Cold Brewers Make Brewing Much Easier Cold brewers historically had two problems. First, you needed to weigh and measure the water and the coffee, get out a calculator, and figure out a ratio. Second, cleanup wasn’t easy. These problems have been eliminated with some of the newer glass brewers that use fine-mesh metal filters. New brewers such as the Penguin and the Alkani have been designed to make cold brew easier to make and much easier to clean up.![Alkani Cold Coffee Brewer setup](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/cold-brew-coffee-setup.BWTiOpQS_qdYR4.webp) The [Alkani](https://ineedcoffee.com/alkani-cold-brew-coffee-maker-review-tutorial/) is one of the new cold brewer models that uses a metal filter, which makes cleaning a simple task. Remove the filter, empty the grounds into a compost bin, rinse, and it is ready for the next brew. ### Other Reasons There are other reasons to love cold brew that I haven’t even explored. One growing area is the use of cold brew in coffee-based cocktails. It is also great to have on a camping or backpacking trip. ### Getting Started Although you could start making [cold brew coffee in your French Press](https://ineedcoffee.com/making-cold-brew-coffee-french-press/), I love the newer dedicated cold-brewers much more. Look into the Penguin or the Alkani. New cold brewers are hitting the market all the time now. Look for a sturdy glass frame, a metal filter, and a size that best suits your needs. ### Resources [21 Reasons I Love Cold Brew Coffee](https://criticalmas.org/2021/04/21-reasons-i-love-cold-brew-coffee/) – An updated list by the author.

# 7 Easy Tricks to Make Your Coffee More Eco-Friendly [Coffee Business](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/coffee-business/)---by [Raza Imam](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/raza-imam/)![7 Easy Tricks to Make Your Coffee More Eco-Friendly](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/7-easy-tricks-to-make-your-coffee-more-eco-friendly/7-Easy-Tricks.png) Coffee is among the most popular drinks in the world, if not the most popular drink in the world. Unfortunately, all those coffee drinkers are unknowingly taking a toll on the environment. Just think about how many coffee drinkers there are in the US. Imagine the coffee shops, office coffee makers, home coffee makers, coffee drunk in hotels and restaurants, and coffee served in airports, schools, and malls. Now take that number and imagine how many similar instances there are across the globe: Europe, Asia, Australia, the Middle East, and South America. Then think about the millions and millions of paper and plastic products that go with the coffee. Things like cups, stirrers, lids, coffee carriers, napkins, etc., are thrown in the trash daily. That is in addition to the massive amounts of water that are taken to grow, harvest, and brew the coffee. Then think about the amount of fuel it takes to ship that coffee around the globe. In some cases, coffee travels 10,000 miles to reach your cup. No surprise that after oil, coffee is the most traded commodity in the world. What’s worse is the massive amount of deforestation that is needed to produce enough coffee to keep up with the world’s demand.![compostable cup](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/compostable-cup1.l29YH3iw_1XOWNI.webp)_Compostable Cup_ So yes, coffee does do a number on the environment, but that doesn’t mean you have to give up coffee cold-turkey. There are plenty of things you can do the lessen the effect of your coffee habit on the earth. ### #1 Just Drink Less This isn’t the easiest thing for most people, but cutting at least some coffee out of your diet is bound to help the environment (not to mention keep your [teeth whiter](https://ineedcoffee.com/no-coffee-or-tea-for-at-least-2-weeks/)). If this isn’t possible, don’t fret, there are plenty of good tips below. ### #2 Buy Local Coffee Because shipping coffee beans around the world spews tons of toxic smoke into the atmosphere, look for coffee beans grown in countries closer to you. Love Kopi Luwak (the bean is best when it passes through the digestive tract of a small tree mammal called the Luwak)? There are tons of other specialty blends that you can get that are grown much closer to home. I know Kopi Luwak tastes good, but it comes from an animal’s feces and it is shipped from halfway across the world. I’m just sayin’… ### #3 Look for Organic Coffee and Fair Trade Coffee Organic coffee is great because it’s (obviously) grown without chemicals, and is usually grown in such a way that protects sensitive ecosystems and the birds that live within them. Most of these toxic chemicals are produced in factories that spew toxins into the environment themselves, so you’re killing birds with one stone by going organic. If you’re going organic and avoiding corporate coffee, you might as well buy fair trade coffee. Rainforest Alliance and Transfair coffees not only ensure fair living wages for coffee farmers, but they also take into account environmental standards in their certification process. It won’t immediately lift people out of poverty, but it’s a start. ### #4 Stay Away From Corporate Coffee More and more coffee giants are cutting down the forest and converting them into large agricultural coffee plantations. Deforestation is not only horrible for the environment, it produces inferior quality coffee. Add that to the fact that the coffee farmers themselves can barely make a living working in these massive corporate coffee farms. ### #5 Use a Mug This one is a no-brainer. But it’s easier if you invest in a really cool mug that you will want to use over and over again; eliminating the need for plastic or Styrofoam cups. There are plenty of websites that sell cool, unique, and funny coffee mugs. You can also create one yourself at CafePress. ### #6 Use Better Filters Not only are they better for the environment, but reusable gold coffee filters also yield a better, less bitter cup of coffee. If that’s not your thing, look for unbleached, biodegradable ones. ### #7 Recycle the Coffee Grounds If you already have a compost heap, you probably throw eggshells, banana peels, and old food into it. Why not add coffee grounds (if you haven’t already done so)? The next time you make some coffee, rather than throwing out the used coffee grounds, toss them in your compost heap or directly into your garden. All the nitrogen in the coffee is a powerful fertilizer. Alternatively, you could use the coffee grounds to keep neighborhood cats from using your garden as a litter box. Instead of using harsh chemicals in your garden to keep away unwanted pests like ants and neighborhood cats, sprinkle coffee grounds and orange peels in your garden. The nitrogen in the coffee burns ants’ legs and is better for the environment than using harmful chemicals. Cats don’t like the smell of coffee either. So here are seven easy ways to make your coffee habit less harmful to the environment. I’m sure there are tons of others. Please feel free to share your own tips. ### Resources [Coffee Brewing Guide](https://ineedcoffee.com/coffee-brewing-guide/) – Our collection of coffee brewing tutorials has many ideas for brewing coffee at home.

# A Coffee Eulogy [Cafe Culture](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/cafe-culture/)---by [Michael Allen Smith](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/michael-allen-smith/)![A Coffee Eulogy](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/a-coffee-eulogy/broken_mug1.jpg) For those who thought the most ridiculous INeedCoffee story was how my kitten was tearing up my Kona plant, it gets worse. This is a story about finding the perfect coffee mug, owning that mug, and then watching it die. It is sort of like the timeless story of Romeo and Juliet, only this time Juliet is a coffee mug. ### Background The year was 1998, and I was working in Clearwater, Florida, at Nielsen Media Research. NMR developed software applications for Nielsen TV ratings and other media. As a software development house, we were always courted by third-party vendors. These vendors were always trying to sell their databases, code libraries, or any other tool to improve our products. Although vendors must get purchase approval from management, they must win over the developers. Developers need to be wooed with bagels, T-shirts, mousepads, and other gifts. When the final decision on which vendor to go with is too close to call, developers make a recommendation based on the company that gave them the best loot. It is a sad but true fact that a $200,000 contract could be lost simply because the sales representative forgot to pass out frisbees to the programmers. ### Forbidden Love MicroStrategy was wooing one development group. At the time, I was building a collection of coffee mugs, and word got back to me that MicroStrategy was passing out mugs to that group. My collection was becoming cumbersome, and I was considering getting rid of a lot of my mugs, so I sort of brushed off the information. I didn’t need a 50th mug taking up space in my cabinet. Then I saw a developer walking by with the mug, and it was love at first sight. This mug was a far cry from the traditionally bland pharmaceutical mugs. It was tall and black with a cool picture of an “agent” on the side. The product being promoted was something called DSS Agent, and the agent design had a 1940s retro look. What made it special was the handle. The handle was blocked and large enough to comfortably fit all four fingers. The first time I grabbed it, I knew it was my _Excalibur_. But it wasn’t my mug; it belonged to members of another group, and they knew this was too good of a bounty to trade for. Despite various attempts, I could not get a mug of my own. A few days later, I was in the break room, and I spied one of the mugs by the sink caked with old coffee. Either someone had yet to clean their mug, or they sat it by the sink, hoping that someone would clean it for them. At that moment I decided I’d clean it for them, back at my house. When the break room was empty, I tossed the mug into a plastic bag and slipped out the back door. From there, I went to my car and buried it under the seat. Thankfully, no one saw me or came around asking for the mug. The mug of my dreams and I were now united. ### Good Times Although I never brought the mug to work, I drank my morning, evening, and weekend coffee almost exclusively from the mug. Coffee seemed to taste better. The larger size was perfect for a single French press. My other normal-size mugs no longer were of any value to me. But the handle was what made this mug perfect. My pinky wasn’t jammed into the handle like it was with smaller mugs. This chalice had no equal. ### The End On January 26th, 2000, the fairy tale ended. Now living in the Washington, DC, metro area, my mug and I headed to work at 6 a.m. to avoid the traffic that normally occurs during snowstorms. The snowstorm was a dangerous semi-blizzard that blanketed the roads and sidewalks with about 12 inches of snow. While hiking from my car to the building in a blinding snowstorm, I dropped the bag holding my mug. When I got into the building, I saw the mug in pieces.![broken mug](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/broken_mug1.DElpiKID_wnF09.webp)_My favorite mug was now broken._ My favorite mug was dead. It was beyond repair. Goodbye, old buddy. You will be missed. Published on February 20, 2000--- #### Michael Allen Smith Michael Allen Smith is both a coffee fanatic and a web developer.

# A Coffee Lover’s Guide to Tea [Tea](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/tea/)---by [Michael Allen Smith](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/michael-allen-smith/)![A Coffee Lover’s Guide to Tea](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/a-coffee-lovers-guide-to-tea/coffee-lover-guide-to-tea.jpg) I never had much respect for tea. I enjoyed the beverage, but it didn’t interest me as much as coffee. That all changed in September 2007. I went to a tea shop in Seattle and tried several teas. Not the dull Earl Grey or the herbal crap, but high-quality loose leaf tea. I got to drink different types of tea brewed at the right temperature for the optimal brewing time. And in an hour, I gained a newfound respect for tea. At that tea shop, I realized that the tea journey is very similar to the coffee journey. The majority of coffee consumed is either poor quality, made incorrectly, or both. The same is equally true for tea. Most of what passes for tea is bland. Just like with coffee, I decided right then and there that I would source high-quality teas and learn to brew them correctly. No more bagged tea, no more boiling water, no more over-steeping.![tea steep in glass teapot](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/DSC01041.DWaRy6LU_9XUxa.webp) I went to tea tastings, took tea classes, went to tea festivals, and brewed a lot of different teas. Most of the teas I tried I had never known existed before. Coffee will always be my first love, but I decided that I wanted to take that journey with tea—the same journey I began with coffee many years before. Within 6 months, I was a tea aficionado. Tea went from blah to ah! If I haven’t convinced you to invest time and effort into quality tea, let me say that good tea always tastes better than OK coffee. Tea is far less perishable than coffee and, in most cases, less expensive. This article will be geared toward the coffee drinker who wishes to get up to speed quickly on tea. ### Types of Tea All tea comes from the Camellia sinensis plant. What makes teas different is the level of oxidation and fermentation. Oxidation, in simple terms, is the browning of the tea leaves. Green teas are not oxidized, whereas black teas are fully oxidized. Oolong teas are partially oxidized and can vary from low oxidation to high oxidation. Pu-erh teas are fermented and aged. They can be a few years old or decades old. When you read about tea, note that many books and websites use the term fermentation instead of oxidation. It can be confusing. For our sake, fermented applies only to Pu-erh teas. Here is a list of the basic tea types. This is an overview. Entire books have been devoted to cataloging the different varietals of tea. 1. **White Tea** – White tea is made from the first buds picked and has a light color. 2. **Green Tea** – This tea is pan-fried or steamed to prevent oxidation. 3. **Oolong Tea** – Oolong teas are partially oxidized teas. They could be lightly or darkly oxidized. They might even be [roasted](https://ineedcoffee.com/home-roasting-oolong-tea/). Some are aged. This is where you’ll find many tea lovers. Some of the world’s finest and most expensive tea plants are used to make oolong tea. 4. **Black Tea** – Black tea is fully oxidized tea. 5. **Pu-erh Tea** – Another area of outstanding tea is the pu-erh (pu’er), which is divided into two groups: raw (green) and cooked (black). Raw pu-erh is fermented green tea. Cooked is fermented black tea. The tea might be one year old or decades old. I once had pu-erh tea that was 40 years old. 6. **Herbal** – Herbal tea is not tea. You might like it, but it is not tea. However, Chai is a mixture of tea and herbs. See our [Traditional Chai Tea Recipe](https://ineedcoffee.com/traditional-chai-tea-recipe/) for more information. I’ve noticed that tea people think coffee drinkers will prefer black tea the most, but my observation is that coffee aficionados most like oolong and pu-erh. Black tea doesn’t hold our interest compared to black coffee. The unique flavors found in oolong and pu-erh are more enticing. My favorites are raw pu-erh, lighter oolongs, and a handful of green teas.![pu-erh-tea cake](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/pu-erh-tea.D6X6beVx_Z1QNgnb.webp)_Pu-erh tea from The Tao of Tea._### Gear Before we get into brewing tea, I want to cover the gear we will need. Coffee drinkers tend to view making their beverage in a scientific way. We measure and time everything. Some tea people do this, but not nearly as much. They like using fancy teapots and appreciate traditional tea ceremonies. None of which, in my opinion, makes the tea taste any better. It’s nice for special occasions, but not necessary for our purposes. Tea is all about water temperature, steep time, and dose. We will ignore everything else. To make excellent tea, you will need: 1. A mug tea infuser or teapot with a filter. 2. Temperature-controlled kettle. 3. Timer 4. Digital scale (optional) We are brewing with a narrow range of temperatures just off a boil with coffee. Teas have a much wider range of brewing temperatures. The less oxidized a tea is, the more sensitive it is to water temperature. Black tea will be fine with water just off of boil, but a Japanese sencha wants water at 155° F. You could screw around with a thermometer in a regular kettle or pot, but we don’t need to do that anymore. Bonavita makes a kettle you can program to the exact degree you need. This is a godsend for making excellent tea, and the goose-neck makes it ideal for coffee pour-overs such as the [Kalita Wave](https://ineedcoffee.com/kalita-wave-coffee-brewing-tutorial/) and the [AeroPress](https://ineedcoffee.com/upside-aeropress-coffee-brewing-tutorial/). That is all the gear you will need. You don’t need the drip tray or the special gong fu pots. ### How to Make Tea With coffee, the brewing variations are determined more by the equipment than the bean. That is not true with tea. Each tea type has its own brewing recommendation, which varies by water temperature and steep time. If you do a search on times and temperatures for brewing tea, you will get wildly different recommendations. Most advise temperatures that are too high for green or lighter oolongs. Many teas can be steeped multiple times. Oolong and pu-erh teas will usually taste better on subsequent steeps. Teas that may cost more are often the ones that can hold up to many steeps. Here are my general guidelines for tea temperatures and first steep times. Start here and adjust to your tastes. Good tea shops will include specific instructions for each tea on the bag. | Tea | Temperature | Steep Time |
| --- | --- | --- | | White Tea | 170-185° F | 2 minutes | | Green Tea | 155-180° F | 1.5 - 2 minutes | | Oolong Tea | 170-195° F | 2 - 3 minutes | | Black Tea | 200-212° F | 3 minutes | | Pu-erh Tea | 200-212° F | 2 - 5 minutes | When you brew a second, third, or greater pot of tea with the same leaves, you may gradually extend the brew time or increase the temperature. Coffee drinkers can be very specific about dosage. In several of the tutorials on this site, I advise using a gram scale to optimize the brewing ratio. Measuring by volume when making coffee can be a little inexact, and measuring by volume in tea is even more problematic. Look at the two teas below. The Japanese kukicha is flat, whereas the Taiwanese oolong is airier. Other teas are rolled into balls and some are packed into cakes. A tablespoon of each will yield different amounts of tea. A digital scale solves the dosing problem.![japanese green tea](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/japanese-green-tea.y_j-VW-y_oqvh3.webp)![oolong tea loose leaf](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/oolong-tea.DvbqjkY8_ZMboK0.webp) Our go-to brewing ratio for coffee is 17 to 1. That means 17 parts water for every 1 part coffee. For tea, it is much higher. I’ve seen ranges from 50 to 1 up to 80 to 1. When dealing with ranges this wide, it speaks to the fact that tea doses are somewhat forgiving. If you are set on nailing down an optimal ratio, get a digital scale with 0.1 gram precision. In my opinion, the dose is the least important variable when it comes to making great tea. Sourcing excellent tea, using filtered water, getting the temperature right, and not over-steeping are far more important. Ratios are more important for coffee. Even though I use my scale religiously for coffee, I usually follow the volume dosing instructions provided by the tea vendor.![kukicha tea brewing instructions](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/kukicha.DxmyNQQK_DYHd7.webp)_Kukicha brewing instructions from Adagio Tea._### Sourcing Good Tea I’ve been to many tea shops, and they seem to fall into two camps. The most common are the ones that specialize in black and herbal teas—think British. The other group is the Asian tea shops focusing on green, oolong, and Pu-erh teas. I strongly prefer Asian shops. They tend to have the teas I am more interested in trying. Just like coffee drinkers seek out single-origin coffee from a region, tea shop owners should be cognizant of the labels they use. A generic label such as “Oolong tea” is suspicious, whereas “2014 Spring Alishan” is transparent and more informative. Mail order is a great option. Those in the Seattle area can find high-quality tea from Floating Leaves, Miro Tea, and Phoenix Tea (Burien). ### Take the Journey! My fellow coffee drinkers, I invite you to take the tea journey. I’m not saying it will be better than coffee—it probably won’t be—but it will be pretty awesome and very enjoyable. If you are going to have a backup beverage, tea is a great option. Just use the tips in this article, and you’ll be ahead of most tea drinkers.![Jo Sencha Green Tea](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/my-green-tea.DvxlwpiG_Zi3LtU.webp)_Don’t mess around with the alligator-style or caged tea filter. Oolong teas are often rolled into balls that can’t be unrolled unless there is room. The in-mug style of infuser lets the tea expand fully. Plus, it is easier to fill and clean._### Resources [Coffee and Tea Tasting Notes For Beginners](https://ineedcoffee.com/coffee-and-tea-tasting-notes-for-beginners/) – A method for learning which teas you like the best.

# A Coffee Education in Columbus Ohio [Coffee History](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/coffee-history/)---by [Ryan Jacobs](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/ryan-jacobs/)![A Coffee Education in Columbus Ohio](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/a-coffee-education-in-columbus-ohio/insomnia.jpg)_Editor’s Note: This article was written in June 2000. Many of the places in this article are now gone. Enjoy this time capsule of the Columbus coffee scene._ Columbus, Ohio is home to The Ohio State University as well as many excellent coffee shops. Whether you want to learn about chemistry or coffee, you can do both here and at the same time. Prior to moving to Columbus to attend _The Ohio State University_, I considered myself a connoisseur of coffee. I would scoff at my father’s pot of Folger’s, while I brewed “hazelnut” coffee for myself. I had much to learn. ### Caffe Fino Caffe Fino resides in The Ohio Union, which is part of the OSU campus. It was here that I had my first espresso-based drink — a Caffe’ Latte. I was very impressed by the rich flavor that came through the steamed milk. At the time, Armando Escobar was running the shop. Soon after that latte, I graduated to drinking straight espresso, also a first at this shop. I am forever grateful that my first espresso was here because I still believe that theirs is consistently one of the best espressos I have ever had. I can only imagine what my attitude toward espresso would be if I had tasted a poorly made one my first time around. I may have been forever scarred, swearing off the drink forever.![Caffe Fino](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/fino1.CtSUUtpg_1j9sqw.webp)_Caffe Fino at The Ohio State Student Union_ Fortunately, I took a sip and found it to be very good. In fact, at the time, I remember thinking that the pungent aroma and bitter taste combined with the creamy texture was intriguing. It wasn’t scalding hot — it was just right. I never imagined that a coffee beverage could have such body without adding sugar or cream. I didn’t realize it until much later, but their demitasse cups were very important to the quality of the espresso. They use the same cups used to serve cappuccino, which I would normally consider too large. However, they do a great job of keeping them heated on the espresso machine. By drinking the espresso from these wide-mouthed cups, your nose is stuck inside as you taste the espresso, which allows you to inhale the aroma as you taste it. This enhances the whole experience. For four years, Caffe Fino was there for me when I needed it most. Before and after classes, before and after exams. Needless to say, I spent a lot of time there. ### Staufs Coffee Roasters To me, finding Stauf’s coffee was like finding the Holy Grail of coffee. I came to Stauf’s shortly after having my first latte at Caffe Fino. Here, with their wide varieties of coffees from around the world, I learned that there was more to coffee than Colombia and Juan Valdez. When I walked in, I was immediately drawn to the new aromas that came from the large drum roasters and bins of coffee. As I examined each bin, I noticed the different sizes of beans, the different colors, textures, and roasts. At the time, darkly roasted coffees were new to me and smelled exotic and tasted the same. My first half-pound of coffee was Baba Budan blend, named after the hero who smuggled coffee seeds strapped to his belly out of Ethiopia. I was virtually obsessed with oily coffee for about six weeks.![Stauf&amp;#x27;s Coffee Roasters](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/staufs_roaster.BGOzbwUJ_Z1VAMXJ.webp)_Stauf’s Coffee Roasters – 1277 Grandview Ave._ I then began ordering the lighter roasts and was amazed at the differences in flavor I was discovering. What Stauf’s excels at is roasting. They treat each coffee carefully and roast it to just the right level. I soon tried blending their different beans to create customized blends and experienced moderate success. Stauf’s was opened in 1988 by Tom Griesemer. Griesemer, originally from Davis, California, teaches a class routinely for the Creative Activities Program at their Grandview location. These classes are one night only, but they are informative and fun. ### Insomnia My exposure to Insomnia started at their campus store. They also have a downtown location. Their house blend is unique (roasted by Stauf’s) and they have a very vibrant cafe. Some places are nice just to hang out in, and this is one of those places. The campus location caters to the students while the downtown location caters to the businessfolk who need a quick fix. As a result, the two locations harbor a different crowd, but the purpose is still the same — coffee.![Insomnia Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/insomnia.-53HD_Ji_ZNMs6B.webp)_Insomnia Coffee – 1728 N High Street and 31 E Gay Street_ I didn’t limit myself to campus stores, though they were the most convenient. I found many other good coffeehouses in the Columbus area. Eventually, this led me to create The Columbus Coffee Guide, a website where I gave the location, hours of operation, phone numbers, and reviews of each shop I visited. I stopped writing the guide in 1997 when I moved to Indiana, but working on that site led me to the following gems. ### Cup O’ Joe When I initially moved to Columbus, there was only one Cup O’ Joe. Now there are four. Bexley, German Village, Campus, and the Airport all have a Cup O’ Joe. This coffee shop serves Stauf’s coffee and, like Insomnia, has a great atmosphere. This cafe has been repeatedly voted “Favorite Coffeehouse” by Columbus readers of Columbus Alive, a local weekly paper. If dessert is your thing, they have a reputation for having a great dessert menu as well. Recently, Stauf’s Coffee Roasters and Cup O’ Joe merged. In the future, Cup O’ Joe will be responsible for handling retail operations while Stauf’s focuses on the coffee. In my opinion, this is a good plan. It is interesting to note that Starbucks really has weak infiltration in Columbus. I attribute this to the fact that Stauf’s excelled at supplying many of the local coffee houses with excellent coffee long before Starbucks became the force it is today. Merging a top-notch roaster with a great retail operation should strengthen both parties.![Cup O Joe Coffee ](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/cup_o_joe.B8rHX427_1HyeBS.webp)_Cup O Joe Coffee – multiple locations_### The Coffee Table The Coffee Table is a very trendy coffee shop in the heart of the Short North area of Columbus. They use Stauf’s Coffee and have tremendous window space, which gives it a bright atmosphere. The Coffee Table is one of longest-running coffee shops in Columbus and has a loyal customer base.![The Coffee Table ](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/coffee_table.DHcHRqKu_y23yT.webp)_The Coffee Table – 731 N High Street_### Basso Bean Not far from the Coffee Table is Basso Bean. They also serve Stauf’s coffee. The interesting thing about this location is that they also serve craft-brewed beers and have a wine list. You can get a great double espresso and they have good food to go along with whatever you get. This is a smoking establishment and you will recognize this upon entry.![Basso Bean](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/basso_bean.CNBNMb1t_ZEi33J.webp)_Basso Bean – 691 N. High Street_### The Crimson Cup The Crimson Cup doesn’t have any retail fronts that I know of, but they provide the coffee for Caffe Fino as well as Columbus Espresso Bars, a drive-thru espresso bar. They also roast coffee for Wild Oats, a large health food store. ### Sweet Maria’s Sweet Maria’s opened in Columbus in 1997, right around the time I moved for a brief stint in Indiana. The irony is that I might never have discovered Sweet Maria’s if I hadn’t left Columbus. Sweet Maria’s caters to the home coffee roaster, and since Columbus was full of places that served good coffee, I had no reason to home roast. Living in Kokomo, Indiana with horrible coffee, however, put me in a tough spot. I was faced with a few choices: 1. Go strictly mail order 2. Revert back to the days of Hazelnut and French Roasted Folgers 3. Investigate something I remembered reading about on a coffee newsgroup long ago — home coffee roasting. Fortunately for me, I chose the third option. After discovering how to do it, I needed to find a supply of green beans. My research told me time and again that the best place was a shop called Sweet Maria’s in Columbus, Ohio. _Note: since the writing of this article, SweetMarias has relocated to Oakland, CA._![Sweet Marias ](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/sweet_marias1.Hmz0up2E_ZvvtiK.webp)_Sweet Marias – 9 E 2nd Street_ As I mentioned earlier, Sweet Maria’s caters to the home roaster. If I had thought that Stauf’s had a wide variety of coffees, Sweet Maria’s had more still. Tom, the owner, continually gets new beans in and even lists roast profiles of each bean on their website. Catering to the home roaster allows such luxuries as not carrying a Kenyan coffee if the particular crop is low grade. It is much more difficult to do this in a cafe where customers always expect Kenyans to be available. Home coffee roasters tend to understand the crop quality variations much more. ### Summary Over the years, many stores have opened and many have closed. However, the good ones seem to have survived — even flourished. If you are ever in Columbus, check out some of these places if you get a chance. They have given me a well-rounded education, and I plan on being a perpetual student.

# A New Tradition : Chocolate Coffee Cake [Recipes](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/coffee-recipes/)---by [Christopher Schaefer](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/christopher-schaefer/)![A New Tradition : Chocolate Coffee Cake](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/a-new-tradition-chocolate-coffee-cake/coffee-pot450.jpg) This all started with some coffee, some leftover ingredients, and sheer boredom. It culminated in a new tradition. One which I hope to pass on to guests, to friends, and of course, to family. Many of my compatriots already know both my passion for fine specialty coffees and my love of cuisine and the culinary arts. It is my desire that, through this piece, you the reader might also become acquainted with how I have melded the two together and ended up with a new tradition. Alongside my love for cooking and coffee, I also indulge in, and perhaps to too great a degree, a love for chocolate. These three passions lead me to a new after-dinner treat; one that pleases the senses as well as sharpens the home chef’s culinary skills. And this is exactly what I look for in new foods: something simple and yet challenging; something that, when shared with others, makes for a wonderful experience for the chef as well as the guests. Simply, it is a light chocolate and egg white cake dipped into espresso. The two tastes complement each other as they combine the simplicity of the two to make the simplicity of one. One act that can only be had from two distinctive parts. There is much joy found at the end of a wonderful meal, where an individual can sit and relax, and partake of two of the most common after-meal traditions: coffee and dessert. ### From My Family to Yours And like all traditions, it has the leeway to evolve into more if you so desire. Traditions tend to have a greater significance when coupled with a particular event. For my household, this new tradition is perfect for those times when close, personal friends are over because they know how much I love coffee, and how I much I enjoy baking. They share in the taste and the significance to the host. It doesn’t need to stop there. As it is a very easy tradition to learn from, it becomes all that much easier to pass it along to the guest. Imparting them with the tradition, for them to take to their homes and for their own personal enjoyment. And, hopefully, they might pass their version along to others. ### The Coffee To start, we need coffee. While I could wax poetically about the proper brew, grind, and tamp I need only reinforce that one can not truly live this experience without a good coffee. Does this mean that you must go out and buy a fancy new home espresso/cappuccino machine? No. Can you get by with a wonderfully strong pot of drip/pour-over coffee? I wouldn’t suggest it. Instead, I stress the importance of Italian espresso from a stovetop espresso machine. ### Stove Top Espresso Found in the kitchens of Italians, adorning the stove top, is a coffee pot. This simple pot implores a bottom vessel for holding water, a fluted filter for holding coffee, and a top portion with a built-in screen that screws onto the bottom vessel. Add coffee, add water, apply heat, and in a few moments, you have made stovetop espresso. It works on the principle of energy expansion and mass transport. The water, as it is heated in the bottom vessel, expands into a gas. The gas pushes the heated water up the flute and into the bed of coffee. It, too, expands and brews as it is continually forced upward into the upper chamber.![coffee pot](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/coffee-pot450.HQSHRi9A_Z1QcJJi.webp)_The Stovetop Espresso Maker_ And while it is not truly espresso, it is a great way to make a richly aromatic, and robust brew. Dark roasted coffees and blends for espresso lend themselves well to this device. They are readily had both at specialty retailers and on the Internet. Look for names such as Bialetti and Mr. Moka. I particularly enjoy the coffee from a stovetop espresso machine because it seems to make many different blends of coffee always end up very rich and aromatic. And because it uses a larger volume of water for brewing, your demitasse is somewhat larger than a shot of true espresso from a pump-driven machine. ### The Cake Once you have conquered the espresso, you can turn to the cake. This is a variation between a sponge cake, a torte’, and a brownie. I call it _Rotondo Luce Torta di Cioccolata_, in Italian, or, _Round, Light Cake of Chocolate_ in English. Its simplicity is paralleled by the dessert itself. ### Ingredients - 4 egg whites - 2 tablespoons powdered sugar, sifted - 4 tablespoons baking flour, sifted - 2 tablespoons unsalted butter (do not use margarine) - 2 ounces unsweetened dark baking chocolate, finely chopped - 1/3 cup granulated white sugar ### Step-by-Step Directions 1. In a glass or stainless steel mixing bowl, whisk or beat on high with a mixer the 4 egg whites until they stiffen. While continuing to beat, gently add the powdered sugar a little at a time until thoroughly incorporated and the whites form stiff peaks. This is the beginning of a simple meringue. Next, gently fold in the flour, one tablespoon at a time. Take care not to break down the whites. Set aside and chill for five minutes. 2. While the meringue is cooling, prepare the chocolate sauce. In a heavy-bottomed saucepan, over a low flame, melt the butter, chocolate, and sugar together until thoroughly melted. Stir rapidly off of the heat to cool. 3. Prepare a shallow cake pan. Lightly cover the bottom and sides with a non-stick cooking spray. Gently dust with flour or unsweetened baker’s cocoa. 4. Remove the meringue and, while folding with even strokes, add the sauce quickly but gently. It incorporates fully but leaves small, lighter streaks within. Immediately fill the prepared pan. 5. Cook in a pre-heated oven, at 325 degrees F, for 25 – 35 minutes. Test regularly for doneness with a toothpick or cake needle. The cake is finished when it begins to pull away from the sides of the pan or when the needle runs clean. Times - Prep. Time = 10 minutes - Bake Time = 25-35 minutes - Total Time = 35-45 minutes ### The Presentation The presentation is key to this newfound tradition. Each person is served a thin slice of the warm cake with his or her shot cup of coffee. They are then allowed to dunk the cake into the coffee. This is the final step to ensure proper exposure to the treat. Alone, the cake is dry and airy. The coffee was rich and strong. Together, they are sweet and moist yet bold and robust. Hence, a compliment and balance of tastes, textures, and flavors. This tradition lends itself well to follow with a hearty meal, and on cooler days. However, I would argue, that it would be acceptable for any day. It might also be served as a stand-alone dessert with a sweet, heavy liquor.

# A Vac Pot Primer [Brewing Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/brewing-coffee/)---by [Mark Prince](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/mark-prince/)![A Vac Pot Primer](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/a-vac-pot-primer/A-Vac-Pot-Primer.jpg) Visit any “hardcore” coffee website or newsgroup these days, and you’ll find mention of something called a “vac pot”. They also go by the names “siphon pot”, “siphon brewer”, “syphon coffee maker” and several other monikers. ### So what’s this thing all about? Simply put, it’s one of the coolest and most fascinating ways to make coffee. The bonus is that it is also one of the best-tasting cups you might ever have. ### History of the Vacuum Brewer Back in 1842, a woman by the name of Mme. Vassieux registered a patent in France for a coffee brewing device that was based on the vacuum brewing method. But she wasn’t the first. In the early 1830s, a few Berliners patented vacuum brewing machines, and Richard French copied those designs in an 1838 patent. The reason why Mme. Vassieux is often mentioned as the “inventor” of the vacuum brewer is because her machine was the first to actually make it into production, and her design is strikingly similar to those in use and made to this day. Through the 1800s, various brewing devices based on the vacuum brewing method surfaced in Europe, including the side-by-side design by John Napier (called a Napierian), and other modifications on Mme. Vassieux’s designs. People liked the resulting coffee, but the very nature of the pressure used in these devices and the materials used (these were the days before Pyrex) sometimes made them dangerous devices. By the end of the 19th century, they started to fall out of favor.![Faberware Vac Pot](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/coffeerobot1.9z_B_-Vs_ZwqxLd.webp)_The Faberware was the first North American electric automatic vacuum brewer. This model is circa 1935._![Tayli Syphon Brewer ](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/taylisyphon.B0QGDPw9_1J7fUR.webp)_This modern-day Tayli Syphon Brewer (Japanese origin) is strikingly similar to Mme. Vassieux’s original design from 1842._ In the early 20th century, the mantle was taken up by American companies, including Silex, Sunbeam, General Electric, Cory, and more. With the invention and perfection of heat-safe glass like Pyrex, the devices became safer. Companies like Cory and Silex (and Cona in Britain) devised a glass filter pipe with a bulbous, rough middle that also eased the use of the devices. By WWII, vacuum brewers were enjoying a good run of success in the American kitchen. In the post-war years, the vacuum brewing method, superior in almost every way, lost out to percolation and auto-drip devices because they lacked convenience and easy cleaning. Americans were all too willing to give up the superior taste for “okay taste” if it was automatic and cleanup was as simple as dumping a paper filter. ### How a Vacuum Brewer works A vacuum brewing device uses temperature changes in water, which results in the vaporization of water to both brew and filter coffee. The way it works is fairly simple. A vacuum brewer has two globes, one on top of the other. They are connected with a syphon tube running between them. The bottom globe, which has an exit hole at the top, contains the water and has heat applied to it. The top globe contains the syphon tube in the bottom, is open at the top, and holds both a filtering device (usually cloth-covered ceramic or a glass filter pipe) and the ground coffee. When assembled and heat is applied, the water in the bottom vessel heats up, expands, and creates water vapor. Vapor (or gas) takes up more physical space than liquid, so as the vapor increases, the pressure on the glass grows, and the remaining liquid seeks to escape. The only route it can take is up the syphon tube to the top globe, through the filter, and into the coffee grounds. Once the device is at full boil, all the water that can go up the syphon does (there will always be some water left in the bottom, as the syphon tube by design is not long enough to reach the bottom of the globe). At this point, the vapor is escaping up the tube instead of water, and this in turn continually heats the water/coffee mixture in the top globe and also creates a gentle rolling action in the mixture. This agitation helps the process and keeps the top coffee at near-perfect constant brewing temperatures – about 10F below boiling. After about 2-3 minutes of brewing (this is a personal preference and dependent on the grind), you remove the heat source, and almost immediately, all these heat-expanded gases in the bottom globe start to contract and turn back into liquid. This contraction contains a fair amount of force. As the vapors contract, something is required to fill the space being left in the bottom globe, and that something is your brewed coffee liquid in the top globe. It gets pulled back down the syphon tube through the spent grounds and the filter (gravity isn’t much of a help to get through those obstacles), and it is pulled down with sufficient force that it actually “vacuums” your coffee grounds once all the water has gone “downstairs”. The finish is usually a bubbling action in the bottom globe for a few seconds as air is pulled through the spent grounds. The “vacuum” name of this brewing method doesn’t come from that particular action; it comes from the fact you are creating a partial vacuum in the bottom globe that uses the coffee liquid to fill the said vacuum. The entire process takes about 12 minutes, including water heating, brewing, and finishing, and is very fascinating to watch. ### My first time About six months before I purchased my first vac pot, I’d heard mention of it on the Internet, and I had vague recollections of my grandmother owning a Cory Vacuum Brewer. I heard claims it was the best coffee going, but like many claims about something I’m not familiar with, I was skeptical. Around April 1999, I was in a Starbucks and noticed they were selling off their supply of Bodum Santos’ Vacuum Brewers for 40% off. I was too tempted to resist, so I bought one and rushed home. I admit I was kind of excited by the prospect of brewing coffee with a method nearly unheard of among everybody I knew. I guess it is a tell-tale sign that I’m a complete coffee geek when I admit I was even giddy at the process I was about to witness. Just witnessing the process for the first time is hard to describe. Remember how cool (or secretly cool) you thought some of the little experiments were in your Grade 10 Physics class? Like when your teacher would do things that go contrary to conventional thought, made things happen that you didn’t think would happen? A vac pot is like that. The very aspect of water traveling against gravity is hard for people to normally imagine. You always think about water traveling downstream, down a pipe, heading for lower ground. With a vac pot, water meets something stronger than gravity: pressure. This forces the “trip north” as I’ve coined it, up to the top globe. Then, when heat is removed, the “trip south” occurs but occurs with enough force that it literally vacuums your grounds dry. The grounds in the top vessel end up with little craters, which is kind of cool to see and definitely indicates complete extraction of your precious brew. I think everyone’s first time with a glass vacuum pot is a similar experience – they can’t get over how cool it looks, forgetting for a moment that they just brewed probably the best coffee of their lives.![Sunbeam](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/coffeemaster.CnqHZNgS_ZJtQgh.webp)_Sunbeam ruled the automatic vacuum brewer market from the 1940s to the 1960s with their CoffeeMaster series. Unfortunately, the coffee produced wasn’t as good as manual devices._![Hario Nouveau](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/harionouveau.DWylB6Zw_1WHzXa.webp)_This Hario Nouveau (Japanese origin) is state-of-the-art in modern-day portable vacuum brewers. It features an angle-locking handle, a superior denatured alcohol burner design, and a unique design and filtering system._### Vacuum Brewers Today and Beyond During the 1990s and beyond, vacuum brewers are enjoying a bit of a renaissance. Not enough to make them even faddish yet, but enough to make them relatively easy to find and add to your household. Companies like Bodum, Cona, Hario, Tayli, and [Yama](https://ineedcoffee.com/vac-pot-brewing-with-the-yama-syphon/) all make vacuum brewers today, and some are pretty economical (Yama models can be had for $35 new, [Bodum Santos](https://ineedcoffee.com/vac-pot-brewing-with-the-bodum-santos/) models for $35-40). They come either ready for your stovetop or self-contained with alcohol or gas burners. They come in a variety of sizes, from 1-cup models from Hario (that makes 8 ounces) to 8-cup models from Cona. And you can pick up some of the mid-century Cory, Silex, Sunbeam, and GE models on eBay for reasonable prices, as long as you don’t expect absolute mint quality (the rare mint ones can cost quite a bit). During the first decade of the 21st Century, I believe this renaissance will continue with either the revival of some long-defunct vacuum brewer makers or new companies forming to manufacture and sell these unique brewing devices. You can thank (or blame) this primarily on Starbucks, which has played a huge part in waking middle America up to coffee that is at least better than the coin-op machine at the gas station. Quality coffee is seeing a full-blown revival, and I believe that in some small way, vacuum brewing, which is arguably the best possible way to make brewed coffee, will ride the crest.

# A Month Without Coffee [Coffee and Health](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/coffee-health/)---by [Michael Allen Smith](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/michael-allen-smith/)![A Month Without Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/a-month-without-coffee/blue-no-coffee.jpg)_This article was originally posted on November 15, 2012._ I did it. I went an entire month without coffee. No coffee and no decaf either. I didn’t even consume coffee ice cream. And somehow I survived, although at times I didn’t think I would make it. You see I have had a very strong relationship with coffee. Even before _INeedCoffee_ was launched in 1999, I consumed a lot of coffee every single day. With the exception of four days in 1997, I have been consuming an average of 4-5 coffees a day for over twenty years. Whenever someone is shocked at how much coffee I consume, I can always point to others who drink way more than I do. Even my caffeine consumption today is half of what it was 10 years ago. ### Addiction and Motivation But coffee addiction is still an addiction. I explained my concern on my blog in a post titled [Caffeinated Delusions](https://criticalmas.org/2012/09/caffeinated-delusions/). > Is comparing current caffeine usage to past caffeine usage a useful metric? That question has been bothering me for a while. This week I conceded that it is wasn’t. **The fact remains that I am equally addicted to caffeine albeit at a lower level than before.** My addiction might even be greater, because today I am consuming espresso that is far better quality than just a few years ago. The strides I’ve made in my home roasting and shot pulling at home have improved a lot recently. By collecting more data and interviewing the best baristas in Seattle, my home espresso quality has improved more in the past 9 months than in the first 9 years I was making coffee. Every month or so my coffee tastes better than it did before. This is making my addiction stronger. People ask me why I decided to take an entire month off coffee. That same post sums up my thoughts at that time. > I need to know who I am without caffeine. This isn’t going to be easy. Tuesday morning I woke up after a perfect night of 8+ hours of deep sleep. I decided I would wait a while before making coffee. I should have been ready to take on the world without caffeine, but I couldn’t. My head wanted coffee. Even though I was fully rested, I was mentally paralyzed. That is when I knew I had to do a real detox, but this one will require more planning, because I need to break the addiction at every level. I had done other health experiments in the last four years. I’ve tested how my body responds to eliminating and reintroducing dairy, gluten, fermented foods, chocolate, and sugar. Those experiments were highly beneficial. I learned I had a gluten intolerance. Removing it from my diet was highly beneficial, as I lost 25 pounds effortlessly, reduced my headaches, and cured a skin issue in the process. The one test I hadn’t done was caffeine and coffee. ### Coffee Taste Deconditioning Countless articles on different strategies used to cut back or eliminate coffee. My favorite is another _INeedCoffee_ article titled [Accelerated Caffeine Detox](https://ineedcoffee.com/accelerated-caffeine-detox/), but I had more than caffeine addiction. Not only was I addicted to caffeine, but I was addicted to the taste of coffee – more specifically, I was addicted to the taste of espresso. Not just any espresso, but some of the best espresso in the world. In addition to my home-roasted espresso blends, by living in Seattle I had access to some of the best espresso in the world. To be successful on my quest to go a month without coffee, I’d have to not only address the caffeine addiction but the taste itself. Enter Seth Roberts. In 2007, he wrote a book called The Shangri-La Diet. This book tackles fat loss by addressing how much reward we place on the flavors we are exposed to. Instead of counting calories or carbs, you consume certain food combinations with weak flavor profiles to _decondition_ yourself from foods with a high food reward. Flavors that are stronger, more frequent, and more predictable end up increasing the body’s fat setpoint. Because espresso, when made properly, has a higher flavor signal than brewed coffee, I decided to create my coffee taste deconditioning plan. For the 10 days leading up to my detox, I decreased my espresso intake and increased my brewed coffee intake. I was still getting caffeine and tasting coffee, but the flavor signal was weaker. Then I purposely started making defective espresso shots. I’d pull shots too fast, so they tasted thin. Or I’d slightly over-roast my coffee and brew it while it was too fresh. Another thing I did was pull the shot before the temperature of the machine had risen to where it was supposed to be. The result was that I was consuming espresso with a weakened flavor signal. The coffee taste deconditioning strategy worked. It allowed me to gradually lower my caffeine levels while reducing the quality of the beverages. This made cutting back and eventually going the full month much easier. ### The 2 Goals My goal was to go all of October 2012 without coffee or decaf; during that month, I would also go 15 days with zero caffeine. At the start and end of the month, I would allow myself some tea, mostly green tea. I exceeded my caffeine goal by going 21 days without caffeine, including chocolate. Many websites say caffeine is out of the body in 3 days, so going longer provides no additional benefit. Although it may be factually true that caffeine has left your body, that doesn’t mean your addiction is cured. When I did my 100-hour caffeine-free experiment in 1997, I was back to drinking massive amounts of coffee within a week. The reason for the longer test is not just to address the physical symptoms, but the psychological ones as well. And I would learn that those were the toughest to deal with. ### One Depressing Month Most people ask if I had headaches the first day. I didn’t, because I gradually lowered my caffeine intake over two weeks. Caffeine headaches are nothing compared to the complete collapse in my mood. For a good chunk of the month, I was extremely sad. It was like a death in the family. During the depths of this period, I realized that I had been using coffee to avoid feeling down. And I had been doing that multiple times a day for two decades. From the post [Medicating Mood With Caffeine](https://criticalmas.org/2012/10/medicating-mood-with-caffeine/) on my blog: > This month my mood has been terrible. Things are slowly getting better though. Prior to the experiment I was consuming 3 or 4 espressos a day plus a few mugs of tea. These beverages were all high quality and tasty. I would spread out my enjoyment of these drinks from morning to early afternoon. Last week a thought came to me that these experiences were little _pockets of joy_. No matter how I was feeling at the moment, I could always rely on caffeine improving my mood. Going caffeine free has removed all these _pockets of joy_. Turns out I am not a happy camper. In addition to having great love for coffee and tea, I now can see that my habit was also my unconscious way of dealing with feeling down. The fact that coffee can improve mood is well known. My concern now is that my addiction to coffee has kept me from addressing the root causes of my low mood. I had another odd side effect of going caffeine-free. Instead of getting better sleep, I started waking up in a near panic at 3 AM on a near-daily basis. I’d be dead tired and unable to fall back asleep. Only in the last week has this gotten better.![Metal Tree Seattle Sculpture Park](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/metal-tree-seattle-sculpture-park.DVhFJpuh_Z23yGzQ.webp)_Photo by Michael Allen Smith (free to use [CC 3.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/))_### My Journey Is Not Yours This month, I received a lot of negative feedback. Many people saw me as a traitor to the coffee cause. I was bombarded with links to health studies that glorify the use of coffee. Of course, I didn’t read them because I recognize that the response to caffeine is highly individual and changes over time. How a group of strangers responds to 5 cups a day holds no relevance to me. Plus, I drink coffee for the taste. Thankfully, I did have a few supportive friends. Three talked me down from the ledge when I was ready to throw in the towel. ### Returning To Coffee My first espresso was on November 1st at 6:30 AM. My heart raced for almost four hours. I thought I had broken my system, but over the next week, I was able to drink one coffee every other day. Now, I am restricting myself to a single coffee or espresso a day, with some days when I have no coffee.![espresso Ballard](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/espresso-ballard.kmgzP853_2rA5Ul.webp)_Returning to espresso._ Although there isn’t a clear consensus on adrenal fatigue, I suspect I had some adrenal damage. About halfway through the experiment, I learned about the herbal adaptogens ashwagandha and rhodiola. Those herbs, in addition to vitamin B5 (pantothenic acid), have a long history of restoring and healing adrenals. Several days after I began taking those supplements, I began to feel better, and my sleep quality improved. Going a month without coffee was extremely tough but a highly rewarding experience. I learned a lot about myself, and I’m now getting by with far less caffeine than I used to. For the first time in my coffee-drinking life, I no longer needed coffee. I plan to do a monthly detox once a year going forward. The next time, I’ll do it in the summer. Going without coffee in Seattle in October wasn’t the best timing. ### Resources [Accelerated Caffeine Detox](https://ineedcoffee.com/accelerated-caffeine-detox/) – An effective way to quickly lower caffeine levels without the pain of going cold turkey.

# A Kona Coffee Farmer Considers Global Warming [Coffee Business](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/coffee-business/)---by [Gary Strawn](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/gary-strawn/) We’ve all heard about global warming and the problems it may create. We’re aware that it could cause severe weather, melting glaciers, and rising sea level. Most people live in the city though and when living in the city, it’s easy to ignore the weather. I spent years working in a tall, climate-controlled building with windows that didn’t open. Even with a torrential downpour, I could go from my house to the garage to my car to work without ever getting wet. We didn’t live near sea level and we didn’t live on a glacier. Severe storms, heat waves, early frosts, droughts, and flooding were interesting news stories but not something that really affected my daily life. Growing Kona coffee for a living is a whole different story. Farming requires me to watch the weather closely and it can have a big impact on my daily life as well as my annual income. This year’s rainy season started a bit late and I can definitely tell because the coffee trees haven’t bloomed correctly yet. Without a good bloom, there won’t be a good coffee harvest. Last year’s weather was slightly cloudier than usual, so we never had a good bloom. It was nothing severe, just slightly cloudier than usual, but it was enough to cut our production in half. The lasting effect will be felt this year, too. Unusual weather one year can have a dramatic effect even years later. It doesn’t take a huge heat wave, prolonged drought, or 100-year flood to get my attention now. I notice even the slightest drop of rain.![waiting for rain](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/Rain1.4U28F0t3_1SiqfQ.webp)_Waiting for rain in Kona_ Some farm jobs, such as spreading fertilizer, are best done when it is going to rain soon. Spread the fertilizer in dry weather, and most of the nitrogen will disappear (volatilize) and fall straight into the atmosphere. On the other hand, too much rain will wash the fertilizer away. Light rain is ideal, maybe 1/4 inch immediately after fertilizing. Fertilizing in the rain is not fun, so I try to guess when the rain is going to arrive and start fertilizing a few hours ahead of time. Sometimes I guess right, sometimes I don’t. Most farm work is easiest to do when it’s not raining. To plan my day I will often check the local weather forecast as well as look out my own window. I plan my schedule based on what I think the weather will do. Sometimes I guess right, sometimes I don’t. I’m not a trained meteorologist, but I can often guess better than the local weatherman. Did you know that many TV weathermen don’t actually have a degree in meteorology? Apparently, good looks and a pleasant personality are more important than actual forecasting abilities. TV weathermen usually rely on the national weather service anyways because they’re the ones with the fancy radars and weather satellites. I have a good friend who majored in meteorology. I remember him taking a class on forecasting. They had data for several different cities across the country and the students competed with each other to see who could make the most accurate weather forecasts. They also competed against a thing called persistence. Basically, persistence is nothing but forecasting the same weather as yesterday. If the weather stays the same, persistence is correct; if the weather changes, persistence is wrong. Forecasting more accurately than persistence is not as easy as it sounds.![weather forecast](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/forecast.nPDIX9Fh_Z1eFEaU.webp)_Weather Forecast_ I once needed a stretch of sunny weather so I could do some painting. Every morning, I’d wake up and look out my window to see bright sunshine. Then I checked the weather report, and it showed heavy rain for the next several days. Taking the weatherman’s word for it, I’d put off the job until the forecast looked better. Of course, it stayed bright and sunny all week until the forecast showed sunshine. As soon as they predicted the sun and I started painting, then it would rain. A couple of months ago I was driving into town and the rain was coming down in torrents. It was so windy and rainy that I almost pulled over to wait it out. At that very instant, the weatherman came on the radio and said “Today will be sunny and warm with calm winds.” Obviously, the guy must have been standing in a studio with no windows because any idiot could see that it was neither sunny, warm nor calm. I don’t put much trust in the daily weather forecast and I never trust the extended forecast because it is almost guaranteed to be wrong. The extended forecast is wrong more often than it is right. That seems extra amazing to me since the persistence model is almost guaranteed to be correct here in Hawaii. With weather radar and satellites that can see the storms coming for miles across an empty ocean, it seems like predicting the weather in Hawaii wouldn’t be all that difficult. There are some very bright people at the national weather service but even with all their fancy technology, sophisticated modeling, and years of experience, they still can’t reliably predict today’s weather. Apparently, this weather forecasting stuff is much more complicated than it seems.![Downpour in Kona](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/Downpour.OorMRzsI_ZPXNpm.webp)_Downpour in Kona_ And that is why I am unconvinced by weather predictions for 100 years from now. Reading news articles and watching the Discover channel, it seems that global warming is a foregone conclusion. I’ve seen Al Gore’s “An Inconvenient Truth” and he seems to present a lot of convincing evidence. His conclusions certainly make good drama. But if you look at the actual data, what we know for certain rather than just what we think might happen, then the conclusions aren’t so straightforward. Even the IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change), the group that advises the UN on global warming, admits that “…long term prediction of future climate states is not possible”. ([Climate Change 2001, part 14.2.2.2, fifth paragraph](https://web.archive.org/web/20181123014117/http://www.ipcc.ch/ipccreports/tar/wg1/505.htm)) Too bad they keep giving predictions anyways. In my lifetime, there have been many dire predictions about global weather. In the 70s it was a coming ice age. The predictions were based on a measurable drop in global temperatures but not much else. In the 80s, Carl Sagan published a report titled “Nuclear Winter: Global Consequences of Multiple Nuclear Explosions” that had us worked up about nuclear winter, a scenario that is impossible to predict accurately. In the early ’90s, Sagan used his nuclear winter theories to predict a “year without a summer” triggered by the burning oil wells in Kuwait during Desert Storm (ABC, Nightline, 1-22-1991). That never happened, despite Saddam Hussein igniting nearly 700 oil wells. The late ’90s were filled with concerns about CFCs and the hole in the ozone layer, which turned out to be easily fixable. Now, there is global warming. At the risk of sounding overly skeptical, I think I see a pattern. I’ll need some solid evidence before I panic this time. It’s been said that we have to act now before it’s too late. I agree that it’s important to look ahead and not be complacent, but I’m not convinced we really know what’s best for the planet’s future. Imagine someone from 1900 trying to decide what is best for us in 2000. In New York in 1900 they had a big problem with horse manure because nobody drove cars, they certainly weren’t capable of legislating our gas prices. President Theodore Roosevelt established the national park system, establishing himself as a conservationist, yet he knew nothing of carbon emissions. Here, from Michael Crichton is a short list of words that Teddy Roosevelt did not know the meaning of: > _airport, antibiotic, antibody, antenna, computer, continental drift, tectonic plates, zipper, nylon, radio, television, robot, video, virus, gene, proton, neutron, atomic structure, quark, atomic bomb, nuclear energy, ecosystem, jumpsuits, fingerprints, step aerobics, 12-step, jet stream, shell shock, shock wave, radio wave, microwave, tidal wave, tsunami, IUD, DVD, MP3, MRI, HIV, SUV, VHS, VAT, whiplash, wind tunnel, carpal tunnel, fiber optics, direct dialing, dish antennas, gorilla, corneal transplant, liver transplant, heart transplant, liposuction, transduction, maser, taser, laser, acrylic, penicillin, Internet, interferon, nylon, rayon, leisure suit, leotard, lap dancing, laparoscopy, arthroscopy, gene therapy, bipolar, moonwalk, spot welding, heat-seeking, Prozac, sunscreen, urban legends, rollover minutes_ The list may be a bit specious but the point is to not assume that we know everything. I’m not willing to bet that citizens of 2100 will drill for oil or drive gasoline-powered cars, are you? Imagine if, during the 70s, we had decided to prevent the coming ice age by trying to warm the Earth. It’s important to keep moving forward and there are some things we can do that are very likely to be a good thing, such as reducing carbon emissions. The danger is that we’ll inadvertently do something counterproductive, such as forcing everyone to use biofuels or banning nuclear power. We can’t predict the future so let’s keep our options open. As a Kona coffee farmer, I am very dependent on stable weather patterns so global warming could have a big effect on me. As an outdoor enthusiast, I am a big fan of environmental responsibility. I’m not saying that global warming isn’t happening, all I’m saying is that let’s not make any rash political decisions. The universe is a highly complex place. I can’t predict the future, and neither can anybody else. Making rash decisions usually backfires, and personally, I’m not yet convinced one way or the other what tomorrow’s weather will be.![Horses](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/Horses.ByCxiDI9_bEN4Q.webp)_1900: Horses_![Astronaut](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/Astronaut.Cwuja0Ie_Z1DaMDx.webp)_2000: Astronaut_![star trek](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/Transporter.C3LAhVnu_ZV804K.webp)_2100: ???_ Published on June 1, 2009--- #### Gary Strawn Have you ever dreamed of quitting your high pressure job, leaving the city and moving to a tropical island?

# A Small Screwball Cake Recipe for Two [Recipes](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/coffee-recipes/)---by [J.B. Bulharowski](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/j-b-bulharowski/)![A Small Screwball Cake Recipe for Two](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/a-small-screwball-cake-recipe-for-two/screwball-cake-recipe.jpg) We are now a small family of two (2), my hubby and me. Not needing or wanting a large chocolate cake; this smaller cake was my adaptation/revision of mom’s WWII vintage recipe. A much larger recipe comes with an interesting World War II history. Prompted by the fact that there WAS rationing in the United States, much innovation in our kitchens was born out of need. Today’s young folks have no concept of the war; even if you didn’t fight, you were affected by it each day you lived. Many staple grocery items were unavailable, or rationed, particularly eggs, butter, and meat. Most families received government-issued ration books which they filled with stamps, and the books were used to procure rationed items as available. My job as a kid was to paste our accrued stamps into the ration books. Other rationed items were products like steel, and luxuries like silk. Silk was used to fabricate parachutes. Many women, I’m sure missed their sheer silk stockings, which were replaced by cotton ones. Families saved steel cans, crushed them to make stacks which we tied up in piles, then delivered them to be recycled and re-processed for war use. Planes and tanks were being built in our factories around the clock, 24/7. We all contributed in our own ways to the war effort. Since butter was rationed, margarine came into being. Margarine was used for public consumption. I remember crushing and mixing a “flavor” pill into some saturated-fatty mix; Crisco, perhaps? Crushing and mixing in the colored flavored pill stained the fat mix an ugly, yellow-orange! Most staples were reserved for military purposes. Our troops got first claims on many foods and grocery items. Eggs, too, were at a premium, unless you were friends with a local farmer who had laying hens. Sometime during the war, dried eggs and powdered milk were introduced. Since butter and eggs weren’t available for luxurious cakes, clever housewives used ingredients that were readily available during that time, and the Screwball/Wacky cake was born out of necessity! Cook’s Illustrated attributed the Wacky recipe to Mrs. Donald Adam of Detroit, MI., who submitted the recipe into a contest sponsored by Time Magazine in the 1940s. Cooking oil was substituted for butter and eggs. Baking soda and vinegar were used as the leavening agent giving the cake a fleeting lift. My addition of coffee to this recipe was inspired by the fact that I despise dumping leftover coffee and I used it as a substitute for the cup of water used for the cake’s liquid ingredient. Hopefully, you’ll enjoy a slightly different flavor the coffee adds to the Screwball treat. Here’s how!![screwball cake finished](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/screwball-cake-finished.DtvRN5AX_1MMYV.webp) ### Ingredients For a serving size of 6. - 1½ cups all-purpose flour - 3/4 scant cup sugar - 1/4 cup natural cocoa powder, not Dutch-process - 3/4 teaspoons baking soda - 1/4 teaspoon table salt - 5 tablespoons vegetable oil - 1 tablespoon distilled white vinegar - 2½ teaspoons vanilla extract - 1 cup water OR 1 cup cold strong-brewed coffee - 1/2 tablespoon Espresso Powder dissolved in coffee (Optional) - confectioners’ sugar, for dusting (Optional) - cooked milk frosting (see below)![screwball cake ingredients](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/screwball-cake-ingredients.DfFHCTfT_Z17yDN1.webp) ### Directions #### #1 Wacky/Screwball Cake Heat oven to 350℉ Adjust oven rack to the middle position. Coat 8″ square baking pan with nonstick cooking spray. An 8” round baking pan may also be used. I seldom use spray anymore due to the residue left on pans, even after washing. I’ve adopted the use of LOL soft butter with canola oil. Works well and there’s no detectable background taste! #### #2 Vitamix Revised/Adaptation Place oil, coffee, vinegar, vanilla extract, and espresso powder into the Vitamix container and secure the lid. Select Variable 1 or the Purée program. Start the machine, slowly increase to its highest speed, and blend for 1 minute; or start the machine and allow the Purée program to complete. Now add the sugar and salt. Pulse till combined.![screwball cake mixer](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/screwball-cake-mixer.Ie120BKx_ZEtPoj.webp) #### #3 For the Dry Ingredients I prefer to mix the dry ingredients; flour, cocoa powder, salt, and baking soda in a small bowl. Whisk the mix, then add to the blender container securing the lid. Remove the lid plug and insert the tamper. Select Variable 6 and Pulse 10-12 times, using the tamper to press the ingredients toward the blades. Pour batter into the prepared pan. _(Optionally, you can sprinkle pecans or chocolate chips atop the batter)._![screwball cake mixing](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/screwball-cake-mixing.CwJbgGo5_Z1XUej3.webp) I prefer to stay with the basic batter. Bake for 25-30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Cool in pan, then dust with confectioner’s sugar, if desired. _(Tightly wrapped, cake will keep for 3 days at room temperature.)_ A good frosting/topping similar to one from Martha Stewart can be used, see [Cooked Milk Frosting](https://www.marthastewart.com/1514932/cooked-milk-frosting).

Never fear. There is hope! No fancy Italian import of a machine can defeat the power of an informed homeowner, armed with a step-by-step tutorial! You can, and you will make the perfect espresso – that IS why you bought this machine in the first place, right? ### 10 Steps to the Perfect Espresso – Courtesy of Rancilio Silvia (and this tutorial)**Step 1:** Once you’ve set up your Rancilio Silvia espresso machine, your first step should be to fill up the water reservoir at the back, being careful not to exceed maximum capacity. There will be a fill line near the top of the tank that indicates the maximum amount of water that can be placed inside.**Step 2a:** Check to ensure all the switches are set in the “off” position, and then plug the espresso machine into an appropriate outlet.![Silvia Machine Off Switch](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/2a-Rancilio-Silvia-Espresso-Machine-Switches-off.C1lvoq1X_Z1P3nz5.webp)**Step 2b:** Then, like all good appliances, you’ll need to turn it ON before you can actually make the espresso. Before making your espresso, you’ll have to allow the machine to heat up. Just like you would let an oven reach the correct temperature before baking a casserole, most espresso coffee machines need to reach their own correct internal temperature before producing the “perfect brew”. Wait until the rectangular orange light next to the power switch goes out; this means the temperature is right.![power on Silvia](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/2b-Rancilio-Silvia-Espresso-Machine-Switch-on.DtF0MIV1_1cInFI.webp)**Step 3:** You can then take the edge off your espresso cups by preheating those, too – place the cups under the steam wand.**Step 3A:** Turn on the hot water button.**Step 3B:** Turn the round button counterclockwise to allow just enough water to fill the cups.![warming cups](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/3a-3b-Rancilio-Silvia-warming-cups.DcRQ7P-y_Wfq0w.webp)**Step 3C:** Turn the hot water button off.**Step 3D:** Close the steam wand valve.![close steam wand](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/3c-3d-Rancilio-Silvia-warming-cups.Cxp46OjE_1e8n3q.webp)**Step 4:** After everything’s been heated up, it is time to get brewing. So, remove the portafilter from its place on the left-hand side of your espresso machine.![remove portafilter](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/4-Rancilio-Silvia-Portafilter.Y1sH194B_Z1i9AmQ.webp)**Step 5:** The basket held by the portafilter is where you’re going to want to dose your ground coffee. For best results – which is obviously what you’re going for if you’ve purchased this high-class machine – use freshly ground coffee. To be honest, stale coffee may result in espresso that tastes a bit off.**Step 6:** Unlike a regular home coffee brewer, you can’t just place the grounds in an espresso machine and be done with them! There’s another step: you want to press down on the coffee grounds. This is called [tamping the grind](https://ineedcoffee.com/espresso-tamping/). Use about 30 lbs of pressure as you press down with the tamper, being sure to give a 90-degree twist before easing off.**Step 7:** During tamping, it’s possible that some loose grounds can migrate toward the edge of the portafilter – so take your tamper and tap it a few times against the portafilter, getting rid of any grounds along the rim. You can also brush them off.**Step 8:** Now that you have a portafilter of tamped coffee grounds, you can install it back onto your Rancilio Silvia, using a left-to-right motion to lock it in place. The portafilter should be almost lined up with the red dot along the front, which lets you know that it’s been inserted properly.![line up](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/8-Rancilio-Silvia-Portafilter._N_9hEs3_Z1MCMik.webp)**Step 9:** Finally, the exciting part: press the button to start brewing! A 2-ounce shot is typically considered a ‘double-shot’, and this espresso machine should take only about 25 seconds to produce a double. Don’t remove the cups too fast though – see that little bit of froth on top? That’s the espresso crema, a brown foam that collects on top of your shot as it brews. A good, thick crema is an indication of a great brew.![silvia brew](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/9-Rancilio-Silvia-Brew.ChKwaawh_Z24TStM.webp)![espresso shots silvia](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/9-Double-shot-crema-from-Rancilio-Silvia.DNBTjih3_Z60SWq.webp)**Step 10:** And as tasty as your espresso was, you also need to remember to clean the machine afterward, in order to keep it in top condition. All commercial espresso machines and grinders need regular maintenance to ensure longevity – and really, once you’ve tasted the Rancilio Silvia espresso, you’ll definitely want this machine to last. After every use, make sure you empty the coffee grinds from the portafilter and run them under hot water. The spouts can easily be kept clean by allowing hot water from the reservoir to flow through while the machine is still warm – not to mention that this will also help prevent any stains from developing on the machine. Clean the group head, seal with a brush and you’re done. ### Resources [Rancilio Silvia Espresso Machine Tips](https://ineedcoffee.com/rancilio-silvia-espresso-machine-tips/) – INeedCoffee article Published on December 28, 2015--- #### Andreanne Hamel My partner Luc Cloutier and I are a team of business owners and espresso lovers, combining our passion for publishing online and our coffee affair into our espresso machines website.

# A Tour of Cafe do Brasil’s Roasting Factory [Coffee History](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/coffee-history/)---by [Barbara Zaragoza](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/barbara-zaragoza/)![A Tour of Cafe do Brasil’s Roasting Factory](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/a-tour-of-cafe-do-brasils-roasting-factory/QualityControl.jpg) Coffee aromas saturate the air along the freeway next to Melito, a town ten miles outside of Naples. A little beyond the off-ramp, a security guard monitors the gate to __Cafe do Brasil_‘s_ roasting factory (also known by one of its brands, Caffe Kimbo). Like most roasters, the factory is located in a suburb where transport vehicles can easily travel to their destination points. But with more than six hundred coffee roasters throughout Italy, blends are proprietary and fierce competition makes most companies shy about opening their doors._Cafe do Brasil_, however, is the second-largest retail seller of coffee in Italy and the number one international exporter in the south. The company has an external relations department headed by Dottoresssa Signora Marizia Rubino, the daughter of Francesco Rubino – one of the three brothers who established the roasting plant. She agreed to give me a tour of __Cafe do Brasil_‘s_ factory, first welcoming me into the company’s slick administrative offices where pastries spread along a table and a hot demitasse of cafe was offered immediately._Cafe do Brasil_ traces its roots back to the three Rubino brothers – Francesco, Gerardo, and Elio – who in the 1950s began to roast coffee beans in their father’s pastry shop and sold their blends in paper bags. Their successful roasting techniques contributed to the reputation of the south’s dark bittersweet blends. Soon, they created the company name, _Cafe do Brasil_, which gave an exotic aura to their roasts.![The Cafe do Brasil Factory in Melito](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/Kimbo.TWvWvMz8_2qjvma.webp)_The _Cafe do Brasil_ Factory in Melito_ While coffee originated in the Middle East, coffee historians traditionally give the year 1615 as the date when Venetian merchants brought the beverage to Italy, thus introducing the dark brew to Europe. But the Campania region knew about coffee far before this date. Medieval physicians from the _Schola Medica Salernitana_ between the tenth through thirteen centuries collected a compendium of dietary recommendations called _The Code of Health of the School of Salernum_, in which coffee was mentioned twice. One Latin hexameter says: > “Coffee to some gives sleep, to some unrest; Headache relieves, and stomach when oppressed; Will monthly flow and urine too procure. Take it slow-roasted, each grain picked and pure.” Written evidence of coffee use in Campania vanished for centuries thereafter. Only at the end of the eighteenth century did coffee re-emerge as an important cultural ritual in Naples when Vincenzo Corrado wrote a treatise specifically dedicated to the brew. A celebrated Neapolitan gastronome, Corrado published _Il credenziere di buon gusto_ in 1773, which listed no less than eleven ways of making the beverage. At this time, caffettiere ambulante or wandering coffee peddlers also popularized coffee as a drink for everyone. Yelling _“Vui vulite o’ caffettiere!”_ they set up tables along the street replete with small burners, cups, saucers, sugar, and a bottle of rum. But coffee roasting, grinding, and boiling remained predominantly an art passed down by parents in the home. Only in the 1960s did a grand split occur with the invention of the tin can. Roasted coffee could now be preserved for longer periods and shipped over wider distances, so people began to buy already roasted beans from a store. _Cafe do Brasil_ became one of the forerunners of this trend, establishing its Melito factory in 1963.![Fresh Roasted Beans](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/FreshRoasts1.S-4_5M5E_ZfsPCv.webp)_Fresh Roasted Beans_ While the legacy of the _caffettiere ambulante_ can be seen today, with cafe bars on every block offering a mere counter to sip-and-go, more than seventy percent of coffee drinking in Italy still takes place in the home. _Cafe do Brasil_ specifically meets this market need, their brands are a near-ubiquitous sight at any grocery store. Signora Rubino takes me from the administrative offices past massive trucks, many filled with sacks of raw beans. She explains that Interkom, a company located in downtown Naples, goes abroad to acquire the beans and then sells them to various roasters. _Cafe do Brasil_ exclusively blends and roasts the coffee. At the far end of the complex, we enter a warehouse rumbling with wall-to-ceiling machinery. Hidden from the naked eye, coffee beans whisk through long tubes into silos, scales, and roasting machines. In the middle stands the ‘brain’ of the warehouse – a trailer brimming with hi-tech computers. Here, several operators in white coats control the roasting process. They first remotely tell the machines to separate the raw beans into a number of different silos. Operators can distinguish between 101 and 117 different qualities of beans, and their skill lies in blending them together. Once they have a blend ready, they send the beans to a scale where they are weighed. Operators then wait for one of four roasters to open and tell the computers to drop the beans inside. _Cafe do Brasil roasts approximately 400 kilograms of beans every eight minutes at temperatures ranging from 200-220 degrees Celsius._ Inside the computer trailer, raw beans chink through a metal tube where operators can physically see and touch a sample of raw beans they plan to roast. A few minutes later, the same beans clank in an adjacent tube, giving operators the chance to evaluate the quality of the final product. The roasted beans are then transferred through tubes into other silos for maturing, a process that takes anywhere from a few days to a maximum of seven days. Once mature, the beans move on to the packaging side of the warehouse, where assembly-line equipment automatically pulls and folds large Kimbo labels on a turnstile to create coffee bags. A machine drops coffee grinds inside the packages and then clamps down to vacuum-seal them. Next, a conveyor belt sends the packages to a monster mechanical arm that lifts them onto a palette. From there, a bright yellow robot drives up, digs a fork into several palettes, and transports the coffee to trucks waiting outside.![Quality Control Machine Inside Computer Trailer](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/QualityControl.CHPm2phf_jmkco.webp)_Quality Control Machine Inside Computer Trailer_ When we return to the administrative offices to talk about coffee quality and taste, Signora Rubino explains that _Cafe do Brasil_ supports two different brands – Caffe Kimbo and Caffe Kose. Each brand has its own blends that range from the fragrant taste qualities of _Aroma Espresso_ to the milder acidic tones of _Caffea Arabica_. Their best-selling _Macinato Fresco_ has a nutty aroma with a bittersweet taste. According to the company website, the Macinato Fresco is made up of beans from Brazil. But when I ask what kind of beans _Cafe do Brasil_ specifically uses, Signora Rubino explains that the company buys beans that come from many different parts of the world. What’s more, when beans are roasted they give off more than eight hundred flavors and aromas. The roasting process, therefore, is complex.![Naples and Mount Vesuvius](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/Vesuvio.CSPyvDi1_Z1EXe3O.webp)_Naples and Mount Vesuvius_ But _Cafe do Brasil_ surely wants to maintain the reputation given to southern Italy of making dark semi-sweet coffee? Signora Rubino answers no. Their company doesn’t want to be known for creating one strong flavor, but rather they strive for an equalization of many flavors and aromas, balancing astringency, acidity, and sweetness together. So what is the roast recipe for any one of their blends? Aaah. Now that’s proprietary. Only the nose and palette can truly ascertain. But the delight, for a coffee lover, lies in the guessing.

# A World of Coffee Flavors [Brewing Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/brewing-coffee/)---by [Alex Scofield](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/alex-scofield/)![A World of Coffee Flavors](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/a-world-of-coffee-flavors/ethiopia-flag.jpg) You’ve heard the routine before, whether it’s from a stand-up comedian or just a friend who remains entrenched in the pre-Starbucks coffee world. Their mantra is a yearning for the old days when options were fewer and a coffee drinker’s choice was between regular or decaf. They cry out, “I just want a large coffee!” The option is still there, folks. Even at Starbucks, the torchbearer of coffee’s New School, you can still get a large, unadorned cup of coffee for less than two bucks. Mr. Angry 21st Century Coffee Drinker will have only one problem here: At many coffee houses, plain ol’ coffee is offered in the form of a Coffee of the Day/Week. Perhaps you’re like me and just accept the daily offering. After all, there’s usually a manageable number of coffees to choose from._Front Porch Cafe_ in Kill Devil Hills, N.C. is typical of many coffeehouses, offering a choice of four coffees each day – a house blend, a single-source coffee, a light roast, and a decaf. For those who consider decaf out of the question, it is tempting to take the path of least resistance and buy what is available. However, when I began buying coffee by the pound and brewing most of my morning cups at home, I knew the time had come to learn about the characteristics of coffee beans throughout the world. Commitment to a pound of beans sustaining me for the next two weeks required some informed decision-making. Learning a bit about major world coffee beans doesn’t hurt for the regular Coffee of the Day customer either – we might as well know what we’re about to sip, right? In the name of informed coffee consumption, it’s time to explore the differences between the taste of beans from major coffee-producing regions. ### Location, Location, Location… and Other Factors First of all, any consumer of global coffee varieties should be aware that the origin of the beans is not the only factor in the coffee’s taste. In some situations, it will not even be the most noticeable factor. The roast of the beans will be a major factor in the taste of your coffee. French Roast and many Starbucks coffees are made of beans that have been roasted to a dark color, giving the coffee an intense taste. It is a roaster’s task to bring out a bean’s characteristics through an appropriate roast level. The brewing method is another major determinant of how a coffee will taste. Several of us at INeedCoffee prefer the [French Press](https://ineedcoffee.com/press-pot-tutorial/) method of coffee-making. This holds especially when the aim is to distinguish between the nuances of taste in different coffee beans. Other methods may produce a “cleaner” coffee with less sediment, but no other method will convey the unfiltered impact of a coffee bean’s flavor than a French Press. Furthermore, differences in bean taste will usually be more evident in the absence of any creamer or sweetener. While I often enjoy sugar in my coffee, I find a pressed, unenhanced cup is the best way to experience a bean’s truest nature. “Every stop on the way from the coffee plantation, how the coffee is harvested, processed, and stored will affect the end result,” said Paul Manning, the owner of _Kill Devil Coffee Roasters_, housed at Front Porch. “Of course, the roasting process ultimately determines many of the final characteristics, but you will never get good results if the raw materials (unroasted beans) are not up to the task” Sure enough, the region still matters. Different countries – and sometimes different regions in the same country – can produce coffee beans whose flavor cannot be imitated anywhere else. Below are some of the most popular types of coffee beans, and some general characteristics of the beans from these regions. ### Colombian Supremo Perhaps the first nation that jumps to a coffee lover’s mind, Colombia remains a coffee-producing giant in both quantity and quality. Colombian Supremo takes moderation to excellence. Colombia’s best beans are moderate in acidity and sweetness and moderate to full in body. “No quality is extreme,” says coffee author Kenneth Davids![Colombia](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/colombia-flag1.RVWiRAUH_nGAvB.webp)_Colombia_### Costa Rican Rich and full-bodied, Costa Rican coffee has a smoky trace evident to many of its drinkers. “Guatemalan and Costa Rican coffees… have wonderful distinctive acidity,” said Manning of two of Central America’s best coffee countries.![Costa Rica](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/costa-rica-flag.BB6DpMRc_fsUtq.webp)_Costa Rica Flag_### Ethiopian For Americans who came of age during the USA For Africa era, there is a pop understanding of Ethiopia as a barren desert with no agricultural capacity. Premium coffee drinkers know better. Ethiopian coffee is my personal favorite, with a rich and sometimes spicy taste that is perfect for a French Press. Ethiopian coffees run the gamut of tastes, and Davids says they are now among the world’s most varied and distinctive beans.”![Ethiopia](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/ethiopia-flag.CPXjk1_T_1441sP.webp)_Ethiopia Flag_### Guatemalan Guatemala’s coffees tend to be rich and flavorful, in part from the volcanic soil that nourishes much of the country’s crops. “Guatemalan coffees generally have a relatively high degree of acidity and often taste of chocolate,” says _SmelltheCoffee_. Many coffee aficionados also note a smoky taste to the Guatemalan bean.![Guatemala](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/guatemala-flag.CQYSTBnG_ZgyuW6.webp)_Guatemala_### India Indian coffee is not a common find with roasters or at coffeehouses, but some aficionados hope that will change. “Indian coffees are under-represented in the coffee market: they are good balanced, mild coffees,” says _Sweet Maria’s_, praising the coffee for its “pronounced body, low acidity and subtle spicy notes.”![India](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/india-flag.C37Ftvk4_1D8cUb.webp)_India_### Jamaican Blue Mountain Jamaica’s finest coffee tends to be expensive, but if your favorite coffeehouse offers it by the cup, be certain to try it. “It has almost perfectly balanced aroma, body, acidity, and flavor,” says _Green Mountain Coffee_. Like Kona (see below), Blue Mountain has some inferior imitators piggybacking off its good name.![Jamaica](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/jamaica-flag.CWqtL4lR_ZcB4jR.webp)_Jamaica_### Kenya AA The ‘AA’ so often associated with Kenyan coffee refers to the bean’s size, the largest on a scale that also includes ‘A’ and ‘B.’ As for the taste? “Kenyan coffees are generally very mellow and often have a citrus taste. …A top quality medium-bodied coffee that is very popular in Europe,” says _SmellTheCoffee._![Kenya](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/kenya-flag.CGLijXTX_Z1uEcND.webp)_Kenya Flag_### Kona You are unlikely to find Kona as a _Coffee of the Week_ offering but can instead find it at gourmet shops or from specialty roasters. True Kona is “medium-bodied, fairly acidy, with some subtle winey tones, very richly flavored and overwhelmingly aromatic when fresh,” says Davids. Like Jamaican Blue Mountain (see above), some inferior coffees sometimes purport to be Kona, and it is worthwhile to find out whether you are drinking the real product. Be especially wary of coffees that are “Kona blends” or “Kona-style,” both allowing for the possibility that little or none of the coffee is true Kona. ### Mocha Java Often an all-purpose synonym for coffee, Java is an area of Indonesia producing a light-bodied coffee bean. Davids notes a “low-toned richness” in Java coffee, high in acidity, and “quicker to finish” than other Indonesian coffees. ### Sumatra Sumatra is the way to go for those who prefer dark and full-bodied coffees, says Manning. There is a wide variety in tastes of Sumatran coffee, often depending on its “wash,” but _Sweet Maria’s_ describes a typical Sumatra as earthy, musty, and natural. ### Conclusion Elvis Costello once said, “Writing about music is like dancing about architecture.” Anybody who writes about the taste of coffee runs up against the same limits – reading some fundamentals never hurts, and it’s good to have some basic knowledge when buying whole beans. But there are limits to how far the written word can convey the differences that exist between the coffees of the world. In the end, it’s best to get away from your computer and begin tasting these coffees yourself. Better still, try two or more coffees back-to-back, to gain a true appreciation for the differences in taste. Coffee Cupping is a method designed specifically for this purpose. Perhaps your favorite coffeehouse will let you try small samples if it serves multiple coffees of the day – it can’t hurt to ask. The global economy has been good for coffee gourmets, who have many more choices than they did two decades ago. The number of options can be intimidating, but some knowledge combined with tasting experience will make it easier for anybody to navigate the world of coffee flavors now available. ### Resources [Coffee Cupping: A Basic Introduction](https://ineedcoffee.com/coffee-cupping-a-basic-introduction/) – INeedCoffee article Front Porch Cafe/Kill Devil Roasters (NOVEMBER 2019: site down) Smell the Coffee (JUNE 2011: site down) Lucid Cafe (JULY 2018: site down) Published on February 1, 2003--- #### Alex Scofield Alex Scofield is a freelance writer who lives in Cape Cod, Mass.

# Accelerated Caffeine Detox [Coffee and Health](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/coffee-health/)---by [Rachel Elliot](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/rachel-elliot/)![Accelerated Caffeine Detox](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/accelerated-caffeine-detox/Accelerated-Caffeine-Detox.jpg) How much coffee is too much? 5 cups a day? 10 cups a day? Perhaps there is no limit? We are all different. Some of us can handle more, some less. As a proponent of quality coffee, I believe that flavor must always come first and caffeine second. When our love for caffeine exceeds taste, we may yield to the dark side of cheap, gut-wrenching coffee to get our fix. Do you want to give up a good Kenyan or Puerto Rican coffee and end up on the street drinking 3-hour-old coffee from the lobby of a tire store? Of course not. How can you tell if you are at risk? Although I’m not a scientist, I do believe I can detect if you are consuming too much with a single question: > _When you are drinking a mug of coffee, do you ever start to think about that NEXT cup you are planning to have?_ If the answer is YES, then this should set off a warning that maybe you are consuming too much. If the great coffee in your mug doesn’t have your undivided attention and instead, you’re off dreaming of the next mug, then, in my opinion, the quest for caffeine has exceeded the quest for quality coffee. An alcoholic doesn’t savor the taste of that first 40oz malt liquor. It is merely a pit stop on the path to drunkenness. Good coffee should never be the pit stop.![coffee planet shaking](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/coffee-planet-shaking1.M68_ViIq_Z2in6nO.webp)_If this describes you, it may be time to cut back on the coffee._ If you just realized that you have been cheating on your beans with a caffeine fling, have no fear. It happens to us all from time to time. There is a way to restore peace to your coffee relationship: DETOX. Short for detoxification, it simply means you will bring back the focus on why you drink good coffee in the first place. Cutting back on the quantity of coffee you drink will shift the balance back to the bean and will upset the caffeine monkey on your back. Detox is rarely easy and will likely be uncomfortable. Ending a caffeine addiction can bring headaches and constipation. There are also health reasons to detox having to do with adrenal support, but that isn’t the focus of this article. ### Different Techniques There are two major schools of thought on how to best detox, as well as a third customized method I’ve developed. One is cold turkey, and the other is called fading. I’ve done both many times and found problems with both. Along the way, I developed my own method, which I’ll explain last. Let’s examine the three methods. #### 1- Cold Turkey If anyone had seen the Frank Sinatra movie The Man with the Gunden Arm, they would have understood what it means to go cold turkey. Sinatra’s character was kicking heroin, not caffeine, so there probably won’t be a need to have a loved one lock you in a closet for the weekend, although some of you may want to retain the services of that loved one just in case. Cold turkey programs work best if there is a start date, end date, and exit strategy. This is the quickest and most painful method of detox and, in my opinion, the least effective. The problem is that although you kicked it for 3 days or so, your body needs a longer period to adjust. I’ve had cold turkeys where I return to pre-detox quantities in less than a week. In other words, it takes a lot of effort and doesn’t stick very long. In conclusion, do not plan on being productive during a detox. You will spend every waking moment wishing you had some caffeine to lift the dark cloud in your head. #### 2- Coffee Fading Coffee fading is cutting daily coffee consumption by 1/2 a cup. Gradually, you can work down to zero or a tolerable level. This method is pain-free but does require planning. You need to measure current consumption and then keep track of every beverage throughout the day. If you drink 10 cups daily and the goal is to get down to zero for 3 days, then this can take 22 days to complete. Do you want to plan every beverage for 22 days? It’s pain-free, requires extensive planning, and requires a longer time. I like coffee fading better than cold turkey, but not by much. It just takes too long to go through the entire process. To resolve the differences and develop a better way, I came up with our third technique, which I called Accelerated Coffee Fading. #### 3- Accelerated Coffee Fading (ACCELERATED DETOX) Instead of decreasing by a measly 1/2 cup a day, you reduce your consumption by 50% daily. Once you go below 1 cup of coffee, drop to zero the following day. Accelerated Coffee Fading is less painful than cold turkey or as long and tedious as traditional coffee fading. The body also has a longer period to adjust to lower caffeine levels than cold turkey. I’ve also included a “pull-out” strategy. Resume your target level by incrementing at no more than a 50% increase daily. ### Summary Using the ACCELERATED DETOX, one can bring coffee consumption back to a level where the beans are the primary love in half the time as traditional coffee fading without the pain and misery of going cold turkey. Although this article deals with quality coffee, you could use it for any addiction you wish to tackle, be it sugar or soap operas. ### Resources [Pre-Surgery Caffeine Detox](https://ineedcoffee.com/pre-surgery-caffeine-detox/) – INeedCoffee article.

# Arabica vs Robusta: No Contest [Coffee Business](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/coffee-business/)---by [Sandi J. Holland](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/sandi-j-holland/)![Arabica vs Robusta: No Contest](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/arabica-vs-robusta-no-contest/arabica-coffee-beans.jpg) Though my research on coffee revealed over 30 species of the genus, the major commercial coffee beans come from Arabica and robusta trees. Arabica (Coffea arabica), named for the Arabs, is the better and more expensive of the two. These trees grow in semitropical climates near the equator, both in the western and eastern hemispheres, at high altitudes. Because ripe Arabica cherries (unroasted beans) fall to the ground and spoil, they must be carefully monitored and picked at intervals, which increases production costs.![arabica-coffee-beans](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/arabica-coffee-beans.CbVzSX7U_1s1YMV.webp)_[Arabica coffee beans](https://www.flickr.com/photos/andreasbalzer/169092459/) by Andreas Balzer_ Robusta trees (Coffea canephora), which are grown exclusively in the eastern hemisphere, also thrive in equatorial climates, but at low altitudes. Their cherries require less care since they remain on the tree after they ripen. Robusta beans have twice the caffeine of Arabica, but less flavor. Some supermarkets carry Arabica, but most of their brands are robusta. Coffee shops generally use Arabica beans, but because their brews are so strong, I don’t enjoy them. I had always been satisfied with the various Maxwell House roasts and blends, until I bought my first bag of Arabica beans, ground them, brewed them, and drank the elixir. To describe the taste of Arabica is difficult without using trite words like smooth and mellow. It has a round taste that is both rich and delicate, with good acidity. This does not refer to an actual degree of acidity, but to the sharp and pleasing taste that is neither sour nor sweet. The difference was evident in my first cup, probably because I had been drinking robusta for years. I was sold, high cost or not, and now I only buy Arabica. In fairness, although most robusta coffee is of a lower grade and inferior to Arabica, there is a premium crop that is the top of the line for robusta beans. Premium robusta is primarily used in specialty espresso blends and is never found in canned coffee. Though it only constitutes 5-15% of the blend, it is used because these beans add body to the taste and make a nice crema in the shot of espresso. This additional body distinguishes the blend in a cappuccino or latte. Premium robusta should only be used for espresso and not other brewing methods. Surprisingly, I have found 100% Arabica coffee in Kroger decaffeinated and Eight O’Clock regular, both in bags of whole beans. If your coffee is Colombian, it will probably say Arabica on the side or back of the package, since this country produces nothing else. Guatemala, El Salvador, Tanzania, and Kenya also produce all Arabica beans. Once when I was a salesperson, a customer asked if we had leather handbags. After our discussion, I stated, “So, you really like leather purses, huh?” She asked, “Have you ever had a leather purse?” I tentatively said that I wasn’t sure and she replied, “Well, once you’ve had one, you will never want anything else.” I purchased a leather purse because of her conviction, and she was right. So, I state with conviction that once you try well-brewed Arabica coffee, you may never want robusta again. It invades the tongue and palate with a delightful taste and divine aroma. You will be encouraged to close your eyes and savor the flavor, just as I describe in my poem [Heavenly](https://ineedcoffee.com/heavenly-coffee-poem/ "coffee poem").

# Adjusting the Mr. Coffee Burr Mill for Espresso Grind [Grinding Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/grinding-coffee/)---by [Eugene Hanks](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/eugene-hanks/)![Adjusting the Mr. Coffee Burr Mill for Espresso Grind](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/adjustable-mr-coffee-burr-mill/adjustments445.jpg) I’ve been a whole-bean coffee drinker for many years and I am also very picky when it comes to coffee. No swill for me! I am also mechanically inclined and love to take things apart. After reading reviews of burr grinders and agonizing over the prices (did I also mention that I prefer to spend more on coffee than equipment?) I decided on a cheaper model- the Mr. Coffee Burr Mill Coffee Grinder – BMX3. The price was right and despite the wildly fluctuating reviews, I knew I could make this thing work right or have my money back from Target. When I got it home and got it out of the box I pulled the coffee catcher out and looked at the burrs. By dialing the coarseness wheel back and forth I could immediately recognize that the space between the two wheels would produce either a ridiculously chunky coarse grind at “E” or an acceptable drip grind at “A”. I wanted a better range to get an “espresso” grind. If you possess the minimum ability to use a Phillips head screwdriver, small adjustable wrench, and maybe a cordless drill you can adjust this grinder and have the fine grind you want.![A 3/32 drill bit worked well](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/tools450.DDZgiEVf_Z29Dgus.webp)_A 3/32 drill bit worked well_### Step By Step Overview Inside the hopper, there are three small rubber grommets/plugs covering three screws. I was able to easily pop one of them off but had to bust out the cordless drill and extract the other two. I lightly pressed the small drill bit and slowly drilled as the grommets extracted on the drill bit.![3 screws must be removed ](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/3screws450.DdErJM4P_Z20mj9G.webp)_These 3 screws must be removed – this is after the little rubber plugs were extracted._ Next, I removed the top 3 screws as well as the single screw on the underside where the top of the catcher goes. It was tricky since I had to get a Phillips hex bit for the cordless and back the screw out with a small adjustable wrench to grip it. I had to do it this way since only a very short screwdriver will fit and alas, I didn’t have one that size.![4th screw](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/4th-screw.BvrWMT7c_Z2e9oRE.webp) I lifted the whole top part and placed it slightly to the side, as much as the wiring would allow. This exposes a large gear and a small gear. I turned the selector all the way to “A” and then removed the small screw holding the small gear. I did scratch a mark on the large gear and small gear so I could return it to the original alignment if necessary. I then lifted off the small gear.![top lid](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/adjustments450.BZEbSe4t_iOycp.webp)_Once you have the top lifted away, this is what you’ll see._![adjustments](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/adjustments445.C-4h_9hR_YooK2.webp) Then I turned the large gear to the right until it stopped. I worked it back and forth peering up through the opening on the underside to see how close the two burrs (wheels) came. I believe about one 1/8th of a turn back to the left by the large gear is about right though closer is certainly possible. I may fine-tune it but this produces a pretty fine grind. I then replaced the small gear being careful not to displace the positioning of the big gear. Then I put it back together in the order I took it apart. Bean test. I ground a couple of tablespoons each at “A” through “E” and was quite satisfied with the results throughout the range. “A” was quite fine and all of the grinds were consistent.![espresso grounds](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/grounds450.DrgR7CdT_ZMwj53.webp)_These grounds were at an “A” setting and they are as fine as any espresso grind._ I must stress that this was a snap to do. Don’t let yourself be intimidated. As for the pros and cons, the machine is space-efficient; tidy, it doesn’t spray coffee grounds everywhere since the collector fits real snug; it’s quick and relatively quiet. It does tend to kick grounds up into the hopper when it has emptied itself of beans. I suspect it will need frequent cleanings, but the top burr twists out quite easily so this is not a problem. There is some static but that is unavoidable due to the laws of physics and will occur to some degree in any electric coffee grinder. If the motor craps out it will be returned to Tar-zhay’ at once. However, I suspect this is a cleaning issue. I also suspect that if you try to grind a whole pound of beans without letting it rest between hopper fills there will be a problem with the motor. Remember, it’s not an industrial or commercial-type device! For the price and the ease of adjustment, I think it’s a hell of a deal.**UPDATE January 2012:** An INeedCoffee reader has informed us that the Mr. Coffee Burr Mill, model BVMC-BHM23, is significantly different than model BMX3 and this tutorial will not apply.

# Alex’s Worst Cup of Coffee Ever [Cafe Culture](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/cafe-culture/)---by [Alex Scofield](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/alex-scofield/)![Alex’s Worst Cup of Coffee Ever](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/alexs-worst-cup-of-coffee-ever/skull-in-latte1.jpg) No need for melodrama; I’m sure that heroin addiction is a whole lot worse than coffee addiction. Regretfully, I have no first-hand tales to offer of robbing a liquor store, shivering in the gutter, or swan-diving into the [worst toilet in Scotland](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0117951/), just to score some coffee. All the same, in my own middle-of-the-road, essentially law-abiding life, bad coffee has brought me to some pretty low places. My love of coffee is partially a taste for the gourmet and partially a need for caffeine. Caffeine cravings prevent me from being 100 percent uppity about coffee quality – in a pinch, I’ll drink mass-market or fast-food coffee that would make some of my INeedCoffee colleagues retch. Inevitably, that leads me to the occasional moment when I’m so hard-up for a caffeine lift that I’ll drink damn near any cup of swill that calls itself coffee. As for the worst coffee I’ve ever had, it’s a two-way tie. I can still taste these two vile brews many years after I ingested them. Both times, all five of my senses screamed, “NOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!” (Yes, historically awful coffee even sounds revolting.) Both times, my caffeine cravings waged epic warfare against the senses, urging me to keep drinking to the last, wretched drop. Two internal Armageddons and the result is a tie – once it was bad enough to stop me, the other time, I kept on drinking.![skull latte art](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/skull-in-latte1.RnqpS46I_1kag48.webp)_Skull Latte_### Coffee Disaster No. 1: Getting What I Paid For God bless that woman who served me that legendarily disgusting cup of coffee in West Virginia. I know neither her name nor the name of the daytime diner where she worked. I only know the place was somewhere west of Charleston. Whatever her name and wherever she may be, that good woman tried everything within her power to prevent the oncoming taste travesty, and she would accept no payment for it. Hours of mountainous highway driving left me weary on the return swing leg of a road trip from Washington, D.C. to Memphis. On a state route, I stopped at a diner mere minutes before its mid-afternoon closing time. If you forced me to guess, I’d wager the diner’s clientele consisted almost entirely of morning coffee drinkers – not types to stumble in during p.m. hours in need of a caffeine fix. I asked if they had any coffee I could get in a go-cup, and the woman behind the counter pointed to a nearly empty pot, in which brown residue clung to the glass above the puddle of coffee at the bottom. “It’s leftover from the morning,” she said. “That’s fine; I’ll take it.” “Are you sure?” I was. The woman poured the remnants of the day’s brew into a Styrofoam cup, popped on a lid, and handed it to me. I pulled out my wallet, but she waved me and my money away. Back on the highway, I took my first sip. I’ve had plenty of coffee that tasted burned from too long in a drip pot. But this was a whole new league of burned. This tasted as though it had been steeped in the grime that collects on a drip-pot burner after a spill. Worse, I hadn’t put any sugar in it. On this day, if I wanted the caffeine, I’d have to drink this badly burned coffee raw, unfiltered, and unsweetened. As I drove, I took several sips, tensing up in defensive anticipation each time. These few sips, however, gave me the jolt I needed. My fatigue was gone, displaced by distaste for the coffee and my reluctance to drink it. As evening approached, I arrived at my destination of Lewisburg, W. Va., having only consumed about one-quarter of the cup. In Lewisburg, the coffee received a fitting disposal. Though I knew about the environmental perils of pouring hazardous waste down the toilet, that’s what I did with the remainder of this coffee. I flushed it out of sight, but I didn’t dare ruin the moment with any flip comments. I’d received fair warning, and the price was right. ### Coffee Disaster No. 2: Main Line Mud I didn’t have the luxury of pouring out the other, transcendently disgusting cup of coffee I drank. It was finals week of my sophomore year at Villanova University, on a morning after my third consecutive all-nighter. Two finals loomed ahead that day. The morning coffee was more crucial than ever. Coffee at Villanova’s dining halls was unremarkable but adequate for someone lacking any coffee snobbery – Maxwell House from a self-service machine. It did me fine. But on that morning in Dougherty Hall, something was terribly wrong. The coffee machine sputtered and clicked before any liquid came out. I stubbornly continued to clutch the self-serve lever, in hopes that something would come out. Be careful what you wish for… The liquid finally sputtered into my mug, and no steam arose. I held the mug, and no warmth emanated from it. Was it possible that somebody at the dining hall forgot to brew up coffee on a morning during finals week? This morning, the clock was ticking, the first of my finals was just minutes away, and I wasn’t going to make it without the caffeine. There was no time to complain to anybody, no time to wait for them to brew a new batch. All I could do was accept what was in my mug, and drink it. Heat can make bad coffee more palatable. At room temperature, the taste of a bad coffee is fully evident, as it was on this day. I sipped what was assuredly the previous day’s coffee, and it almost tasted solid – like very badly burnt grounds that had been retrieved from the garbage. No amount of sugar could negate its rancid flavor, but I tried my best. I added three, then four, then five packets of sugar to the cup. I took another sip, and my stomach recoiled at the yucky yin-yang of a taste, both charred and nauseatingly sweet. As I continued sipping, tears began to fall from my eyes, at first a drop or two, then a Guy Watches “Field of Dreams” Catch Scene amount, then a Woman Watches “Beaches” amount. There I was, bawling in the bowels of Dougherty Hall, finishing a coffee despite my body’s unrestrained pleas to the contrary. It gave me what I needed. I made it through the two exams, and a few days later, I was home catching up on sleep. Such were the times when I could abuse my body through marathons of sleep deprivation and recover fully within a matter of days. ### Conclusion: All Apologies That’s my Awful Coffee Hall of Fame – two members. May there never be a third. I apologize to all who want to hear more hardcore tales from addiction’s depths. As far as addicts go, we the coffee junkies rate pretty low on the drama scale – our drug of choice is legal, widely available, and potentially inexpensive. I’m at peace with my coffee habit, even if it drives me to some desperate lengths at times. The pleasure I derive from the ritual of drinking good coffee outweighs the misery of the occasional gruesome brew.

# Advice on Starting A Coffee Business [Coffee Business](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/coffee-business/)---by [Alex Fisenko](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/alex-fisenko/)![Advice on Starting A Coffee Business](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/advice-on-starting-a-coffee-business/advice-on-starting-a-coffee-business.jpg) One of the main reasons for starting a business is to make money. If you want to make some real money with the coffee retail business, you must follow the steps that will lead to that goal. ### Location This will be the most important factor in your success or lack of it. You may have the best coffee in the world, but if the prospective customers can’t see you, or your access is not convenient, your chances of success will be greatly reduced. Some espresso bars gross $2000-$3000 a day, 70% of this revenue coming from espresso-based drinks, and the owners of these establishments put in their pocket (or purse) about $25,000 a month in profits! If you have an excellent location, and assuming that you do everything right, you can expect to gross anywhere from $20,000-$30,000 in your second month of operation and end up the first full year with over $500,000 and reach over one million on your third year. Assuming that your rent is $3000-$8000 per month, this should leave you with 30%-40% of your sales after the break-even point. Therefore, if your rent is $3000 and you gross $20,000 your break-even point will be approximately $12,000 and your earnings about $3000-4000 from the $20,000. You can figure how much you will make from $500,000 a year or more.![undertown-port-townsend-wa](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/undertown-port-townsend-wa.cdaRVzMv_J2o05.webp)_Undertown Coffee – Port Townsend, WA_ The locations with the best probability of success are, in order: 1. Next to colleges and universities, on a commercial _walking_ street 2. Downtown business district, in a large office building 3. Neighborhood commercial _walking_ streets 4. Heavy foot traffic tourist areas with great visibility 5. Airports and large medical facilities (for carts and kiosks) 6. Strip Malls 7. Inside shopping malls Don’t forget to check with zoning and Restaurant Health Inspection Departments and make sure that they will allow you to open and operate such a concept on that location. This is especially important for the drive-thru locations. ### The Design Besides an attractive visual design, your espresso station must also be designed for speed and efficiency of service so your customers don’t have a long wait. There have been times when I had to wait ten minutes to get served my latte, with only a few people ahead of me. Slow, sloppy service like that may reduce the number of drinks that you sell in a given time period, reflecting directly on your revenues. It will also upset your customers, which will also affect your revenues. ### Marketing If your menu is meaningless and confusing to a new customer, the customer will end up asking for the most familiar item, “house coffee”, and you won’t be able to develop an espresso drink customer base. Think about the price difference between a cup of house coffee and a latte! That difference is almost pure profit. I believe that one of the best ways to build your coffee business is by developing an effective, customer-friendly espresso drink-based marketing program. By achieving that you will make more money for yourself and be in a stronger position against your competition. After twenty-seven years in this business, I have come to the conclusion that the single most important factor besides the location- for the success of an espresso operation is whether the owner, the CEO, or the person responsible for the overall project is an espresso-based drink consumer himself or herself, and understands what a properly prepared drink should taste like. Unfortunately, properly prepared espresso drinks are hard to find in most parts of this country. So when a prospective CEO or a future franchise owner of a bagel shop, for instance, has his or her first “espresso experience” at a place that has no clue, and that first sip proves to be unpleasant or indifferent, these CEOs never develop a taste for espresso and are probably wondering what all that excitement is all about. With such a mindset, espresso-based drinks won’t be on the priority list of many owners and espresso drinks will represent only a minor part of their revenues. Most of the coffee sold will be of the “regular” type. This will result in lower revenues, lower customer satisfaction, and the failure of providing the customer with a compelling reason to return on a daily basis. ### Taste If your customers do not like the taste of your espresso-based drinks because of faulty preparation techniques, they either won’t order it again or won’t come back. Unfortunately, most of the espresso served in this country has no relation to the real thing, and the only way it can be consumed is by drowning its thin, overheated, bitter, flavorless, overpriced taste in some fancy flavored syrup. By the way, the taste of an espresso-based drink has more to do with the way it is prepared than with the coffee or equipment being used. I had some tasteless cappuccinos prepared with $11.00 a pound coffee with a $10,000 machine, and some excellent ones made from $5.00 a pound and a $3000 machine. You may be surprised to know that most of the espresso operations in this country do not understand how to properly prepare espresso-based drinks. By “properly”, I mean good-tasting drinks made fast. Though taste is subjective, most of the customers, when tasting the same coffee, prepared with the same machine, but one cup made “right”, and the other made following the training guidelines of the operation, will taste the difference and prefer the “right” cup 95% of the time. What is the use of blending and roasting the best coffee in the world if it becomes unpalatable during the preparation stage at the retail level, and the only way it can be consumed is by drowning its bad taste with flowered syrups? ### What it takes to be successful To succeed in the coffee bar business, you must make coffee drinks your main product; from these, espresso-based drinks should account for at least 50% of your total sales. Espresso-based drinks account for over 65% of their total gross sales in many of the most profitable and successful coffee bars. You can brew around 50 cups of regular coffee from the same pound, and sell it at $1.00 a cup. That is around $45.00 gross profit! Add the cost of a paper cup, lid, sugar, cream, and that brings the cost to around 25 cents per cup. You make 75 cents a cup. Now, let’s go a step further: suppose that most of the coffees sold are espresso-based drinks, you would still pay from $5.50-$7.00 a pound for the beans and produce, on the average, around 60 shots from a pound at a cost of around 12 cents for a single shot. Add for the cup, milk, etc., and that would bring the cost of a cappuccino or latte to around 35 cents. But your sale price per cup, on the average, would be around $2.00. You make $1.65 a cup! That would make an enormous positive impact on your bottom line! ### Sample Statements Here are actual statements (rounded) from two of my past stores: Example 1: Opening cost (1981): Large office & retail complex in a business district (San Francisco) Operating Cost: $42,000 total build out from shell Size: 630 square feet Opening Cost: $42,000 total build out from shell Hours of operation: 7 AM – 5 PM, Mon-Fri. Sat & Sun doing one-third of normal sales Bean usage: 120-150 pounds a week Cost of cappuccino/latte: $1.10 (1986) Sell Price: (1986) $150,000 Food cost $6600 22.1% Labor $6860 22.8% (2 FT, 1 PT) Rent $3000 Paper, Supplies $1800 Phone $100 Insurance $350 Maint & Repairs $200 Utilities $500 Refuse $150 Misc. $200 Total operating Expenses $19,760 Profit before depreciation, taxes, repayment on loans, etc. $ 10,240. (month) As you can see, 85% of my gross sales was from espresso-based drinks. Example 2: Location: Next to a University in OR Rent: $3,000 (month) Size: 1800 square feet Build Out Cost: $95,000 (1994) Rent: $2500 in 1986, ($4100 when sold) Bean usage: 130-250 pounds a week Hours of Operation: M-F 6:30 AM – 6:30 PM Summer business is one-third to half of normal Sales when sold: $290,000 yr. Net Income: (to owner) $55,000 yr. ### How Much Investment? Here are rough estimates of how much capital you will need to open your business. - Fully Equipped Cart or Inside Kiosk: $10,000-$30,000 - Fully Equipped Drive-Thru: $25,000-$120,000 - Coffee House/ Bar: $50,000 and up Let me be more specific about coffee houses: all the equipment (espresso machine, grinders, refrigerators, ice machine, sinks, etc.) that you will need to operate a coffee/bar house will be approximately $18,000, the rest will be used for remodeling costs, furnishings, signs etc. I opened stores from $17,000 to $120,000 for myself and from $63,000 to $187,000 for my clients. I served as a consultant to clients that opened coffee bars/houses ranging in total initial investment from $50,000 – 187,000. Considering that Starbucks invests around $325,000 to open a store, my clients did OK! Your start-up investment to open a coffee bar may vary greatly with the chosen location. Though the cost of the equipment will remain the same, around $18,000, the remodeling costs may go from $30,000 to $250,000 or more, depending on the quality of the location and the surrounding stores. Obviously, if you are opening in a prestige location the landlord will demand a sizable investment to make the store look good, comparable to the adjacent stores. They won’t even talk to you unless you can show them that you have enough capital to develop such a project. ### Resources [Starting Your Own Coffee Franchise](https://ineedcoffee.com/starting-your-own-coffee-franchise/) – INeedCoffee article Published on June 16, 1999--- #### Alex Fisenko Alex opened and operated 16 espresso bars in diverse locations, including the Ohio State University Student Union and the University of Michigan.

# 3 Alternatives To Using a Keurig Coffee Maker [Brewing Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/brewing-coffee/)---by [Michael Allen Smith](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/michael-allen-smith/)![3 Alternatives To Using a Keurig Coffee Maker](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/alternatives-to-using-a-keurig-coffee-maker/alternatives-to-keurig.jpg) You do not want a _Keurig Coffee Maker_. Is making coffee really that hard? I don’t think so. If you are considering buying a _Keurig Coffee Maker_, please read this article. I have faith in you, and I think you can handle a simple coffee brewing method that will yield a much better-tasting cup of coffee. With the brewing method alternatives described below, you won’t be using stale pod coffee. You can seek out whatever coffee you want and grind those beans before brewing. You will discover that your coffee’s quality will be much better. A _Keurig_ is probably an acceptable option for the lobby of a tire store but for your kitchen? No. You can do much better. Here are three ways to make a single cup of coffee that are better than the Keurig. ### #1 Porcelain filter (aka Dripper) Put ground coffee into a paper filter. Set the filter in the ceramic holder over a mug. Pour hot water and wait. This coffee brewing style is straightforward and has a much smaller footprint than the Keurig. It is also much cheaper, at less than $20. Several different shapes and colors are available for this coffee brewing style.![Pour Over coffee Porecelain](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/pour-over-coffee-porcelain.DkO4BYpv_Z10bXLY.webp)_Porcelain Pour Over Coffee Filter_### #2 The AeroPress The AeroPress makes a great cup of coffee.

# The Alkani Cold Brew Coffee Maker – Review and Tutorial [Brewing Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/brewing-coffee/)---by [Michael Allen Smith](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/michael-allen-smith/)![The Alkani Cold Brew Coffee Maker – Review and Tutorial](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/alkani-cold-brew-coffee-maker-review-tutorial/Alkani-Cold-Brew-Coffee-Maker.jpg) One of the great things to happen in home coffee brewing in recent years has been the innovation in cold-brew coffee gear. What do I mean by innovation? After all, a cold brewer doesn’t require power or need to maintain a specific temperature. It is simply a vessel for letting ground coffee contact water for 12-24 hours. The innovation is making this process easier to start and clean up. Back in the day, the only non-DIY (do it yourself) option for cold brew coffee was a big old Toddy plastic bucket with that weird pad-like filter that needed to be cleaned and then replaced after every 10 or so uses. And it was fine for the time, but things are better now. Today, you can purchase cold brew coffee makers that are glass, use metal filters, and are both easy to set up and easy to clean up._The Cold Brew Coffee Maker_ from Alkani is the latest example of a cold-brew coffee maker that gets it right. The brewer uses a sturdy glass container that serves as both the brewer and the pitcher to store the brewed coffee. Along the side, you have volume markings indicating how much coffee is in the pitcher once the brew is complete. The Alkani has a thin metal filter with a handle, which makes it easy to remove once the brew is complete.![Alkani Cold Coffee Brewer setup](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/cold-brew-coffee-setup.BWTiOpQS_qdYR4.webp) ### Step-by-Step Tutorial for the Cold Brew Maker by Alkani Let me show you how easy it is to make cold brew coffee with the Alkani. #### #1 Grind Coffee There is no need for scales. Just grind 1 to 1.25 cups of coffee medium-coarse to coarse. See our [Coffee Grind Chart](https://ineedcoffee.com/coffee-grind-chart/) for a visual explanation. I found that 1.25 cups is enough to fill the metal filter. I’m using a lighter roast. Darker roasts might take a few more beans, as coffee expands and becomes lighter in weight during the roasting process. #### #2 Place Filter Into Cold Brewer A metal ring with a rubber edge serves as a collar to hold the filter up during brewing. Make sure it is in place. Once it is in place, lower the metal filter into the coffee maker.![place filter inside cold coffee brewer](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/cold-brew-setup-with-aeropress-filter.jcGPrHy7_WkPAU.webp)_I placed my AeroPress funnel over the Cold Brewer to prepare for the next step._#### #3 Add Ground Coffee to Filter This is the hardest step since you need to aim the grounds into the opening, but it isn’t hard. Just get a funnel. I discovered that the AeroPress funnel is the perfect size for loading the cold brew filter with coffee grounds. If you don’t have an AeroPress funnel, you can roll up a piece of printer paper and hold it together with tape.![add ground coffee to cold brewer with aeropress filter](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/cold-brew-add-coffee-aeropress-filter.6n6kgq7W_Z1xAJIH.webp) #### #4 Slowly Add Water Until the Grounds Are Covered Slowly add water over the grounds. I do not use the markings on the brewer’s side for guidance. I’m filling the brewer so the water line is high enough to cover all the ground coffee. If you are using 1.25 cups of coffee, that means to the top. Using less ground coffee, you won’t need to fill the brewer with as much water.![add water to cold coffee brewer slowly](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/cold-brew-add-water.CimvqYn7_qMY4y.webp) #### #5 Wait 18-24 Hours Let the coffee brew sit for 18-24 hours. I use my kitchen counter, but you could also place it in the refrigerator.![cold coffee brewer in progress](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/cold-brew-finished-side.C16srKWc_4gALE.webp) #### #6 Completing the Brew When you remove the filter, some coffee will leak, so do this step at your sink. Place the filter in your sink and serve or store the finished coffee in the refrigerator. Later, you can empty the coffee grounds into a compost bin. The only step left is to clean your equipment so it is ready for the next brew. ### Alkani vs Home and Above (Battle of the Cold Brew Coffee Makers) I like the _Alkani Cold Brew Coffee Maker_. It is similar to the _Cold Brew Coffee Maker_ from Home and Above, which was covered in the post  [An Easy Guide to Making Cold Brew Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/easy-guide-making-cold-brew-coffee/). There are a few differences: 1. Alkani uses a thicker glass with a fatter bottom, which makes it more stable on the counter. 2. Home and Above uses a thicker, more sturdy metal filter. 3. Both units have a slight opening that exposes the coffee to the air, but that opening is very small for both. If this concerns you, place a plastic bag or wrap over the opening during brewing. Also, because both units are not watertight at the opening, resist the urge to shake the brewer to accelerate the brewing, or if you do, cover the top and agitate it slowly. 4. If you use the container to store your coffee, the Alkani will take up more space horizontally (wider), and the Home and Above will use more space vertically (taller). I don’t use either for storage; I transfer the coffee directly to Mason jars. Shortly after publishing the tutorial on the _Cold Brew Coffee Maker_ from Home and Above, a bag of groceries tapped my brewer, and it tipped over on the counter, rolled, and then crashed to the floor. Glass was everywhere. I believe that had that happened to Alkani, it would not have tipped over and rolled onto the floor because the weight is mostly in the base. (The brewer was empty at the time) The metal filter from Home and Above is thick and more sturdy, but it doesn’t impact the quality of the brew. I have used that filter since I brew directly into a Mason jar. I like both brewers, but I prefer the thicker bottom-heavy design of the Alkani.  If I wanted a brewer that occupied less space on the counter and in the refrigerator, I’d give the edge to Home and Above. If I could provide one improvement idea to either cold brewer, it would be to develop a cover to protect the glass. It could look and function similar to the one used to protect the glass on the [Eva Solo Coffee Brewer](https://ineedcoffee.com/eva-solo-coffee-brewing-tutorial/). ### Resources [Cold Brew Coffee is Not Rocket Science](https://ineedcoffee.com/cold-brew-coffee-is-not-rocket-science/) – The basics of cold brew coffee.

# An Introduction to Affogato (Recipes and Tips) [Recipes](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/coffee-recipes/)---by [Greg Nolan](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/greg-nolan/)![An Introduction to Affogato (Recipes and Tips)](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/an-introduction-to-affogato-recipes-and-tips/affogato-recipes-tips.jpg) Though you may know the dessert drink as affogato, the full name of this delicious concoction is **affogato al caffe**, which translates literally to “drowned in coffee.” This is a pretty apt name, as the classic recipe for affogato is simply a scoop of ice cream and an espresso shot over it. That simple recipe is pretty easy to make at home, but there are a few ways to transform your affogato al caffe into art. You can go the classic route and use vanilla gelato instead of ice cream, freeze your glass for a frosted look and chilly presentation, or even garnish it with a variety of different options. The affogato is the perfect, simply impressive dessert for dinner parties and other get-togethers. When it comes to presentation, consider buying an affogato glass. Any short, heavy glass will work, but most companies actually have an affogato glass available. The shape of the glass is what’s important—it’s narrower at the bottom and wider at the top, allowing the ice cream to stop part of the way down and melt into the bottom. This mixes with the espresso and is both delicious and aesthetically pleasing.![affogato with vanilla ice cream](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/affogato-vanilla-ice-cream.C_-ewwBb_ZKSKcf.webp)_This Affogato is Vanilla Ice Cream with an Aeropress “shot” of espresso._  ### Delicious Garnishes to Consider - Coffee beans are either coarse or fine (as a Turkish grind). This will not only offer a tasty garnish, but also an interesting texture experience. - Powdered cocoa (for a sweet tooth, use hot cocoa packets). - Chocolate Shavings. You can do this with a room-temperature chocolate bar and a vegetable peeler. - Cookie crumbs. Biscotti is perfect for this. - Chocolate syrup is a classic and an old favorite. - Whipped topping with chocolate syrup creates a classic “ice cream sundae” look that will appeal to those who may not be adventurous enough to try it otherwise. - Wafer straws or chocolate straws Crushed nuts or almonds ### Variations on the Affogato Not everyone has an espresso maker, but it’s possible to use regular coffee if the coffee is made double or triple-strong. This allows for the same flavor as the espresso. In addition, you can replace vanilla ice cream with chocolate ice cream or even add sponge cake to the bottom. For more adult variations, consider sweet chocolate and coffee-based liqueurs. Chocolate is good, as well as Amoretto or Kahlua. ### Affogato Tips You have about a minute and a half to enjoy affogato al caffe. The contrast of the dish matters—the cold of the ice cream versus the hotness of the espresso and the sweetness of the ice cream versus the bitterness of the espresso. Affogato al caffe is a dessert very common in Italy, but outside of the country, it is usually categorized as a beverage. Considering how fast it melts, you may want to provide guests with both a spoon and a straw. ### Resources [Making Lattes Without an Espresso Machine](https://ineedcoffee.com/making-lattes-without-espresso-machine/) – If you don’t have an espresso machine, you can still make affogatos.

# AeroPress Coffee Maker Tutorial [Brewing Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/brewing-coffee/)---by [Ryan Jacobs](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/ryan-jacobs/)![AeroPress Coffee Maker Tutorial](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/aeropress-coffee-maker-tutorial/aeropress-coffee-maker-tutorial.jpg) The Aerobie AeroPress is a single-cup coffee brewing system that is excellent for traveling or as a solution for quality office coffee. The system is priced between $25 and $30, which I find reasonable. In addition to the core brewing system, you will get 350 AeroPress filters and a holder for them. The device shares similarities with several other [coffee brewing methods](https://ineedcoffee.com/coffee-brewing-guide/). It uses a plunger to force water through the coffee, which will be familiar to [French press](https://ineedcoffee.com/press-pot-tutorial/) users. The pressurization in the plunging action is similar to that of an espresso machine. Let me be clear: this is neither an espresso machine nor a press pot. Compared to other brewing methods, I find the richness of flavor comparable to French press coffee, while the smoothness is more like a Cafe Americano. This AeroPress brewing system makes coffee by forcing water through the coffee under pressure. The result is a concentrated brew of coffee that you can then use for different purposes. These instructions focus on brewing the coffee and then diluting it with hot water to _normal_ strength.![aeropress coffee maker](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/aeropress-coffee-maker400.Cf-cSmdd_doHSA.webp) *Aeropress Coffee and Espresso Maker *### #1 Insert Filter Select one of the round AeroPress filters and place it into the bottom of the black filter cap.![aeropress empty black cap for filter](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/aeropress-empty-black-filter-cap.D5MtDLwy_PK6TV.webp)_AeroPress filter cap_![add paper filter to aeropress cap](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/aeropress-black-filter-cap-with-filter.DivNzmUy_ozN8v.webp)_AeroPress filter_ At this point, you should rinse the filter. This will help the filter stay in place and minimize the chance of any paper-residual flavor entering the coffee. ### #2 Twist Filter Into Place Place the filter into the bottom of the brewing chamber and twist it into place. Now, place the brewing chamber, filter side down, and on top of the mug that you will be drinking from.![aeropress brewing chamber](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/aeropress-brewing-chamber.DIUBwA2M_1CKkYD.webp)_AeroPress brewing chamber_![twist filter onto aeropress](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/aeropress-twist-filter.DeSKEiWb_1bUL6V.webp)_AeroPress twist filter_### #3 Add Coffee Using the scoop that came with the AeroPress, measure two scoops of coffee for a 16-oz mug. You’ll want to experiment a bit with your grinder and taste preferences when selecting the grind, but in short, a grind between espresso and drip is a good target to shoot for. See our [Coffee Grind Chart](https://ineedcoffee.com/coffee-grind-chart/) for a visual explanation. If you misplace your Aeropress scoop, two scoops equal 20-22 grams of coffee. A funnel comes with the AeroPress to help you get the coffee into the brewing chamber without causing too much mess. While this is definitely a convenience, it isn’t absolutely necessary. In either case, get that coffee into the chamber.![aeropress scoop coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/aeropress-scoop-coffee.DdWzI2wx_1bpY9U.webp)_AeroPress coffee scoop_![add coffee grounds into aeropress coffee brewer with funnel](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/aeropress-add-ground-coffee-funnel.DeZKtgdU_1D4Rwa.webp)_Pour coffee grounds._### #4 Heat Water The AeroPress instructions indicate using water at a temperature between 165 and 175 degrees F. Feel free to experiment a bit to see what works for you. I actually found that water just off the boil worked great for diluted coffee. Make sure to heat enough water to reconstitute your mug to 16 oz. ### #5 Add Water and Stir Use the markings on the cylinder to determine how much water to pour into the brewing chamber. Since we are making diluted coffee, we will use the top of the markings as a guide. Add just a portion of the water at first so that the grounds can swell a bit, then give it a good stir with the included stirrer so that the grounds settle back down a bit—similar to preparing French press coffee.![use aeropress paddle to saturate coffee grounds](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/aeropress-paddle.CYT9Diei_ZoeXLu.webp)_AeroPress coffee stir_ Add the remaining water so the brew is at the top of the number 2 oval. Let the water steep for about 10 more seconds, and give the brew another quick stir.![aeropress add hot water](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/aeropress-add-water.CJemUFa7_2lVvBn.webp)_Add water to AeroPress and stir with the paddle._### #6 Plunge After a total brew time between 45 and 90 seconds, place the plunger into the chamber and apply a steady amount of force to move the plunger downward. Make sure you plunge all the way down until the plunger just begins compacting the coffee at the bottom.![aeropress post plunge](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/aeropress-plunge.CjKj3EWS_24r2n5.webp)_AeroPress plunge_### #7 Remove AeroPress and Add More Water Remove the brewing unit from your mug and reconstitute the brew with your remaining hot water.![add water to aeropress concentrate](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/aeropress-add-more-water.BRlRtA2D_ZBj9KR.webp)_Add hot water to AeroPress brewed coffee._### #8 Serve and Enjoy! Enjoy your AeroPress coffee! ### Cleanup Remove the filter cap from the AeroPress brewer and push the plunger the remaining way over a compost bin. This will eject the coffee grounds, which now resemble an espresso puck. Once this is complete, rinse the AeroPress so it is ready to use again.![aeopress coffee finished brewing](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/aeropress-finished.CXoA9G-o_Z1rnYLP.webp)_AeroPress filter after brewing_### Resources [The Upside Down AeroPress Brewing Tutorial](https://ineedcoffee.com/upside-aeropress-coffee-brewing-tutorial/) – Our detailed tutorial explores other variables you can manipulate when making coffee with an AeroPress.

# Anti-Starbucks Crusader To Run For New York City Mayor [Coffee People](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/coffee-people/)---by [Michael Allen Smith](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/michael-allen-smith/)![Anti-Starbucks Crusader To Run For New York City Mayor](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/anti-starbucks-crusader-to-run-for-new-york-city-mayor/rev-billy-anti-starbucks-sermon1.jpg) Bill Talen, who is better known as Reverend Billy, is now running to be the next Mayor of New York City. Some longtime INeedCoffee readers will recall that in 2002, Reverend Billy went after coffee giant Starbucks. He delivered sermons in Manhattan on the _ruthlessness_ of Starbucks Coffee. From _Reverend Billy’s Starbucks Invasion_ by Bill Talen: > When Starbucks’ scouts enter a new neighborhood, they listen for the laughter. They find where culture is still original, not corporatized, and that is their opponent and prey, for Starbucks is a jealous God. They approach the landlords of the community, whether it’s a diner or a restaurant or a bar. They offer far more than the traditional tenant can afford, because Starbucks arrives with its Nasdaq funny money. They arrive from a completely different economy, and evict the business that native residents have built for years. This is a famous Starbucks tactic and has been repeated throughout the country and abroad. It is a kind of bombing. It is violent. READERS. DO I HAVE A WITNESS? STOP THE BOMBING!!![rev billy](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/rev-billy-anti-starbucks-sermon1.Dulcjsn6_1qu7GM.webp)_[Reverend Billy / What Would Jesus Buy](http://www.flickr.com/photos/canarypromo/422816266/) by Mason Wendell_ Reverend Billy is now going after Wall Street and banking bailouts. Since New York is home to this crisis, Billy has decided to run for Mayor as a member of the Green Party. The election will take place on Tuesday, November 3rd, 2009. From his platform page on the _Reverend Billy Talen for NYC Mayor_ website: > As Mayor of New York, Reverend Billy Talen will continue the work he has done for more than a decade as a champion of local ingenuity and neighborhood know-how. United as he already is with the city’s many communities, his administration will be the connecting force reaching out to all New Yorkers, to create a city that is sustainable, just and free; defending public space, self-determination, and the right for every New Yorker to earn an honest, independent living. As a friend and contributor to INeedCoffee, we wish him the best of luck. RESULTS: Reverend Billy finished 4th in the Mayoral election with 0.8% of the vote. ### Sources [Billy Talen](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/billy-talen/) – Contributor page on INeedCoffee.

# Ascent of the Green Beans – 5 Ways Cafes, Chains and Consumers are Going Green [Coffee Business](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/coffee-business/)---by [Alex Scofield](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/alex-scofield/)![Ascent of the Green Beans – 5 Ways Cafes, Chains and Consumers are Going Green](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/ascent-of-the-green-beans-5-ways-cafes-chains-and-consumers-are-going-green/tall-french-press-pot.jpg) Umesh Bhuju tries to do his bit to make the world a bit greener. These days, it’s more than the “Reduce, Reuse and Recycle” mantra long associated with environmental consciousness. Umesh and his wife Zillie opened Zumi’s Ice Cream and Espresso in Ipwsich, Mass. in 2003. In addition to implementing eco-friendly business practices, Zumi’s hosts lectures on global coffee-related issues, like Fair Trade practices or landmine victims in coffee-growing communities. The Bhujus’ efforts are typical of many small coffeehouse businesses that try to raise environmental awareness on both the local and international scale. Umesh Bhuju said he’s seen an increase in customers’ interests in “going green” since Zumi’s opened in 2003. “The whole idea of sustainable coffee awareness … I think that trend has really taken off, especially Fair Trade,” Bhuju said. “That type of customer we’re getting is increasing.” Coffee is the second most highly traded commodity in the world, trailing only petroleum. In 2005, the average U.S. citizen consumed an estimated 24.2 gallons of coffee, according to a [survey](http://web.archive.org/web/20160331225810/http://www.ers.usda.gov:80/amber-waves/2007-june/coffee-consumption-over-the-last-century.aspx) by the Agriculture Department’s Economic Research Service. The same survey estimated that the sales of coffee at coffeehouses nearly doubled between 1998 and 2003. Given the scope of coffee consumption and its international impact, it’s not surprising that an increasing number of coffee lovers want to be conscientious consumers. The Organic coffee sector alone grew an average of 33 percent annually between 2000 and 2007, according to the Sustainable Markets Intelligence Center in Costa Rica. Organic, Fair Trade, Shade-Grown and Bird-Friendly certification labels are now common sights at cafes and coffee retailers. From small, individual habits to global-minded consumer choices, below are five ways that cafes, chains, and individual coffee drinkers are going green with their beans: ### Another Go-Round for Grounds The rhododendrons in front of our house have never looked as good as they do this spring. A coincidence – or does it stem from the used coffee grounds we keep dumping on them? Coffee grounds are popular with gardeners for compost piles and worm boxes. _Compost Guide_ recommends coffee as a usable organic material for compost piles, and says, “Worms love coffee grounds and coffee filters.” Meanwhile, ants and slugs detest coffee, according to many gardeners, and used coffee grounds at the base of a plant may help keep pests away. At Zumi’s in Ipswich, Mass., some customers routinely leave buckets at the cafe, where staff will fill them with the cafe’s used grounds. The customers return several days later to pick up the buckets. Owner Umesh Bhuju said he offered used grounds from the time Zumi’s opened in 2003, but the bucket routine took a while to develop. Starbucks also packages its used grounds and makes them available to customers who request them. Coffee grounds work well with plants that prefer acidic soil – rhododendrons being one of them. At our home, we simply dumped used coffee grounds at the base of our rhododendrons through the winter and early spring months. For suggestions for more devoted gardeners, see [Compost Guide](https://www.compostguide.com/) or the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s [compost page](https://www.epa.gov/recycle/composting-home).![rhododendrons](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/rhodos1.BNDz1PlN_Z1dkulf.webp)_The rhododendrons in front of our house look better than ever after a steady winter diet of coffee grounds._### Power of the Press Pool In those bygone days of the dot-com boom, I worked in the Northern Virginia suburbs, where a Starbucks run was a twice-daily routine for my office. It worked fine when we were all paid handsomely, single, childless, and gas was less than $2 per gallon. Judging from the crowds at Starbucks, we had plenty of company among local tech-sector employees.![french press](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/tall-french-press-pot.CZGpMe9o_Z1yRbPz.webp)_The French Press as an office coffee substitute._ With the $4 Gas Gallon Era looming ahead, it may be time to reconsider this practice – especially for those who work in Suburbia and need to drive to get coffee to go. An office coffee pool reduces driving and is a major money-saver on the coffee front. Even a $15 bag of premium beans is more economical than buying coffee out every day. Typically, office coffee pools involve a drip pot. My recommendation, however, is to try to recruit a few co-workers for a [French press](https://ineedcoffee.com/press-pot-tutorial/) pool. A hot-water source in [the office](https://ineedcoffee.com/the-quest-for-good-coffee-in-the-office/) is a prerequisite; pool members can take care of everything else. Somebody needs to keep a French press at his or her desk, and everybody takes turns buying premium beans, coarse-grinding them, and bringing them to work in an airtight container. If there is an office freezer available, it’s a [judgment call](https://ineedcoffee.com/coffee-storage/) as to whether it should be used to store the ground beans. Pressed coffee isn’t for everybody, and that’s precisely the point. Press pools at the office have a bit of a cult feeling. Those involved tend to be appreciative of great coffee, and grateful somebody had gone the extra mile to bring in a press. At the above-mentioned dot-com, and later as an editor for a community newspaper, I really bonded with some fellow press pool members at work. Often, they were coworkers I barely knew before discovering they liked intense, sediment-heavy coffee. Great coffee, interesting people, cost-saving, gasoline-conserving. What’s not to like? ### Cup: Useth Over Like many cafes, Zumi’s in Ipswich, Mass., provides incentives for customers to bring in their own mugs. Those who do so receive 10 cents off their coffee. “That’s an incentive we’ve had from the beginning,” said Zumi’s owner Umesh Bhuju. For customers who remain in the cafe to drink their coffee, Bhuju said, “We’re also encouraging people to get the ceramic mugs we’re providing.” The cafe saves on paper cups and reduces the number of paper cups, lids, and hot-cup sleeves that would otherwise be bound for the trash. ### One Word: Bioplastics Wasted paper coffee cups became a bit less wasteful in 2006 when Green Mountain Coffee Roasters of Vermont introduced Ecotainers, disposable cups with biodegradable waterproofing. For their innovation, the team of Green Mountain and International Paper was one of four recipients of the Specialty Coffee Association of America’s 2007 Sustainability Awards. The cups Green Mountain introduced are waterproofed with bioplastics from corn. According to the Specialty Coffee Association of America, consumers use 10 billion paper hot cups each year. Typical coffee go-cups are waterproofed with polyethylene, a non-biodegradable petrochemical. International Paper plans to design Ecotainers for several other customers. ### Know Your Beans “Look in your kitchen – do you know where your beans come from?” asks Dean Cycon, founder and president of Dean’s Beans Organic Coffee Co. of Orange, Mass., on the [company website](https://deansbeans.com/). Dean’s Beans sells only certified organic, Fair Trade, and kosher beans. “Supporting Fair Trade and organic coffees makes a big difference,” said Zumi’s owner Umesh Bhuju. Zumi’s coffee is roasted by Dean’s Beans. “It’s not only the taste of the drink. … They’re also helping the wonderful people who grow this coffee.” Most coffeehouse regulars are familiar with the Organic and Fair Trade certification labels, which speak to the environmental and economic conditions for the coffee growers. Coffees certified as organic by the U.S. Department of Agriculture contain at least 95 percent organic ingredients. Peru, Ethiopia, and Mexico are the leading producers of organic coffee, which is now grown in 40 countries, according to the Sustainable Markets Intelligence Center in Costa Rica. Other countries that export organic coffee include Rwanda, Haiti, and Vietnam. Primarily, Fair Trade certification pertains to prices and labor conditions for coffee farmers, but it also means that the use of agrochemicals was limited in growing the coffee. Of the Fair Trade coffee sold in the U.S., 78 percent is certified organic, according to TransFair USA, the certifier for Fair Trade in the U.S. ### Conclusion To my surprise, per-capita coffee consumption in the United States is nowhere near its peak. While it has been on the increase since 1995, the heyday of coffee drinking in the U.S. was in 1946, when the average American drank 46.4 gallons of coffee a year, according to the Agriculture Department’s survey mentioned above. However, coffee consumption in the U.S. has resumed an upward trend since the mid-90s, and it is increasingly becoming an era of high-end coffee. Premium coffee beans come from a growing number of countries. Wherever their source of origin, exported coffee beans take an interesting journey from their harvest to the consumer’s cup. As Dean Cycon suggests above, it’s worth our while to know where our coffee comes from. Our choices as coffee consumers, in all likelihood, have a wider global reach than ever before.

# Bad Bob Interview [Coffee People](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/coffee-people/)---by [Alex Scofield](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/alex-scofield/)![Bad Bob Interview](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/bad-bob-interview/mockupbob125x179.jpg)_This article was written in December 2000, when the 2nd version of INeedCoffee was launched._ INeedCoffee, like many websites, is considered by its creators to be a perpetual work in progress. Change is a constant, and those of you who have visited for some time now have certainly noticed changes in content, functionality, and appearance. However, as INeedCoffee unveils its new look, one element remains unchanged: the masthead is still a creation of Bob Therrien, better known to the world as BadBob.![coffee man v1](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/coffeeMan11.B5cdRvai_Z721NU.webp)_INeedCoffee Bad Bob v1 (April 1999 – December 2000)__![coffee man 2](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/mockupbob125x179.BCzuo-NA_Z1RPq3H.webp)INeedCoffee Bad Bob v2 (December 2000 – April 2003)_ Does Bad Bob’s style look familiar to you? If so, you may well have seen some derivative of “Screaming Man”, a cartoon he drew for the Advocate, an alternative weekly newspaper in New Haven, Connecticut. BadBob was born in Georgetown, Connecticut, and has moved “in and out of Connecticut” through the years. However, a contracting job brought him out to Colorado in the mid-1990s, and there he has remained ever since, now living in Broomfield, Colorado. ### A Rocky Mountain Relocation “When I first got here, I was out of shape; fat, even,” BadBob explains. “Now I can’t imagine leaving [Colorado]… I do rock climbing and kick-ass hikes on trails where you run down using the same muscles you use for snowboarding.” “I’m 100 years old, but I’m free climbing on the Flatirons,” he says, adding that he is often able to cruise past many of the younger hikers. BadBob has also taken up snowboarding and golf, rounding out a near-complete adaptation to the classic image of an outdoorsy Colorado lifestyle. ### Artistic Evolution In his new environs, Therrien’s professional and artistic lives have evolved along with his recreational life. Bad Bob’s day job consists of mechanical engineering and technical illustration, and while he no longer cartoons on a regular basis, he continues to draw close relatives of Screaming Man and insinuates that there may be more cartoons to come. Cartooning is but one of his artistic interests, and his more recent efforts have been in other endeavors, recently including “murals, ink drawings, and watercolors. Paintings are taken from pictures I’ve taken.” Not content to confine himself to the visual arts, Therrien also obeys a lifelong passion for music. He plays guitar and sings for different permutations of musicians, usually dubbed the BadBob Band. “I’ve been playing music all my life,” Therrien says. “I played in a punk band in the day of punk, and I was in a lounge band in the ’70s.” While the lounge band did travel, BadBob and his fellow musicians were eventually bogged down in dead-end gigs in Maine and Alabama. He recalls, “We sucked, so I guess we deserved it!” ### Coffee Credentials So what has drawn INeedCoffee to seek Bad Bob’s artistry twice over? Is it a coincidence that the favorite cartoonist of several caffeine junkies is himself a caffeine junkie? It turns out that Bad Bob’s coffee-drinking credentials are as serious as they can get. One need only see a cartoon adorning Bab Bob’s personal website to know exactly where the artist stands on the issue. Several coffee drinkers adorn the site, most notably a gun-toting, Screaming Maniac, who demands of his target, “What part of ‘no decaf’ don’t you understand?” Bad Bob’s life, to a less violent degree, is indeed reflective of his art. “Yes, I’m a frequent coffee drinker,” he says. “I drink many kinds of coffee; I’m not a snob at all..I try to find many sources of caffeine; not just coffee.” When asked if he views it as a luxury or a legal drug, Therrien says: “I like to think of caffeine as a legal drug, because I’m addicted to it. I have to have it.” ### The Perfect New Look INeedCoffee is proud to once again have Bad Bob’s work adorning its site. It is abundantly clear why: Bad Bob’s style, be it his artistic style, lifestyle, or style of caffeine intake, makes his Screaming Coffee Man a perfect symbol for coffee devotees and the information they can find on INeedCoffee. So log on, pour yourself a cup, and when the caffeine begins to kick in, scream right along with Bad Bob’s new coffee character. ### Resources [The Caffeine](https://ineedcoffee.com/the-caffeine/) – 2 poems by Bad Bob.

# Avoid Hydroxycut, Drink Coffee Instead [Coffee and Health](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/coffee-health/)---by [Michael Allen Smith](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/michael-allen-smith/) On May 1, 2009, the FDA issued a warning on the Hydroxycut supplement line. From the FDA website: Warning on Hydroxycut: > FDA has received 23 reports of serious health problems ranging from jaundice and elevated liver enzymes, an indicator of potential liver injury, to liver damage requiring liver transplant. One death due to liver failure has been reported to the FDA. I thought this supplement would disappear since ephedra was removed as an ingredient in fat loss pills. Although it was one powerful stimulant, ephedra, when combined with caffeine and baby aspirin, was a powerful thermogenic supplement—too powerful for me. I was amazed to see why people still bought an ephedra-free Hydroxycut. I guess dieters will always want a quick fix to their weight problems. After ephedra was removed from Hydroxycut, The Healthy Skeptic went through each ingredient in the supplement to see if it still had any benefit and came to this conclusion. > Hydroxycut is a supplement that combines ingredients with dubious pedigrees with ingredients that _may_ prove to be beneficial in some regard _other_ than weight loss, topped off with stimulants.![Espresso at Neptune Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/neptune-coffee-espresso1.svmtsjR6_1STOsA.webp)_Espresso at Neptune Coffee_ As a coffee drinker, I always shake my head in disgust at these so-called fat-burning stimulants. Coffee is a tasty, zero-calorie beverage that gives one the energy to go for a run or lift weights. Why is this? According to Dr. Jonny Bowden: > The slight increase in blood sugar from caffeinated coffee is a boon for athletes…who need that blood sugar to fuel their muscles. For years, I’ve slightly increased my morning coffee intake before I go to the gym. I’ll have a bonus espresso about 15 minutes before heading to the gym. It kicks in about the time my warm-up sets are completed. And if I’m too unmotivated to go to the gym, then I deny myself that espresso. Guess what? I rarely miss a workout. ### Resources The Healthy Skeptic: Hydroxycut – Weight Loss Supplement or Myth? – by Sal Marinello _(2017: article no longer online)_[Warning on Hydroxycut](https://web.archive.org/web/20161024065813/http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/PublicHealthFocus/ucm155600.htm) – FDA website [ECA Stack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECA_stack) – Ephedra, Caffeine, Aspirin (Wikipedia) Published on May 1, 2009--- #### Michael Allen Smith Michael Allen Smith is both a coffee fanatic and a web developer.

# BeanSafe Coffee Storage Container Review [Brewing Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/brewing-coffee/)---by [Chris Arnold](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/chris-arnold/)![BeanSafe Coffee Storage Container Review](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/beansafe-coffee-storage-container-review/BeanSafe-Review.jpg)_**UPDATE September 2020:** The BeanSafe Coffee Storage Container is no longer available for sale._ Freshly roasted coffee deserves proper storage. When coffee beans are roasted, they release a lot of CO2, especially for the first few days. Ideally, you want to let the CO2 out but also keep the oxygen from coming in. Oxygen, along with light, heat, and moisture, is an enemy of fresh coffee. ### Introducing BeanSafe Coffee Storage Containers BeanSafe Coffee Storage containers provide a one-way valve and otherwise airtight storage solution to keep your coffee beans fresh. Although they can also keep out light and, to some degree, moisture, most containers can’t really do much about heat. If the room you are storing your beans in is hot, eventually, your beans will be too. But practically speaking, I have not found this to be a problem. BeanSafe Coffee Storage Containers hold 16 ounces of coffee with room to spare and are available in the following colors and materials (all lids are BPA-Free polypropylene): #### 304 Food Grade Stainless Steel - Basic Stainless Steel with a black lid - Basic Stainless Steel with a white lid - Blue with a black Lid - Green with a black Lid - Purple with a black Lid - Red with a black Lid #### BPA-Free polypropylene - White with white lid - Black with black lid All containers, lids, and valves are dishwasher-safe. BeanSafe does not recommend removing the silicone valve; instead, it recommends placing the entire lid and valve together in the dishwasher.![BeanSafe Coffee Storage](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/DSC01206.aVD5DRes_Z11n1O8.webp) ### BeanSafe vs. Friis I am comparing the BeanSafe coffee storage containers to my trusty Friis Coffee Vault storage containers. The Friis has served me well, but they have two main issues. The valves are meant to be replaced, and although they include extra replacement valves, this is an added cost over the life of the container, since replacement is recommended every 2 months. The other problem is with balance. When you open the hinged lid to fill it up with coffee beans, it almost always tips over. The BeanSafe seems to address both of these issues. The BeanSafe valve system is a piece of specially shaped silicone rubber with a hole in it. Inside, there is a glass bead that is just heavy enough to cover the hole but light enough so that as CO2 builds up, it temporarily pushes the bead out of the way to let the CO2 out and then returns to its position to keep oxygen out. Although this does mean that the container must remain level to be effective, they claim that the “Valve…never needs replacement.” While I never believe statements like that, I do think the valve should last for years, likely only if the silicone degrades or becomes malformed.![BeanSafe Coffee Storage](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/DSC01214.D6fDIKxm_ZB1Whj.webp) I tested some freshly roasted coffee whole beans in both my Friis and the BeanSafe. Although I don’t have a way to measure the CO2 levels being expelled or any oxygen coming in, the coffee tasted very good coming out of both containers over the period of about 7 days. I ground beans fresh out of both containers on Espresso, Drip, and [Cold-Brewed Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/cold-brew-coffee-is-not-rocket-science/) methods, and they tasted excellent and were not discernibly different between the Friis and the Bean Safe.  I wanted to see if I could record a video of the glass bead rise and fall, but the top exit slit was too small to see inside. I would have to cut the silicone away in order to do this, and I didn’t want to ruin such a beautiful product. Perhaps I will do this in the future as an experiment. ### Included Extras and Ground Coffee The Stainless Steel color, as well as the Black and White BPA-Free polypropylene containers only, include a scoop. The color versions include an orange coffee scoop and a DIY reusable Keurig K-Cup compatible coffee pod, which are nice extras. The reusable K-Cup compatible coffee pod is a great way to save money on those expensive replacements, and increase the quality of your coffee over the mediocre pre-packaged K-Cups you get at the grocery store. Also, BeanSafe says that you can store ground coffee if you wish. Friis does not recommend this, as their design has the potential to clog the valve. Although I did not test storing ground coffee, sometimes you must grind ahead of time for short trips like camping or weekend getaways, and it is nice to know the BeanSafe valve will handle that.![BeanSafe Coffee Storage Lid](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/DSC01215.DfatpNpd_S4WN6.webp) ### Concerns One area of concern I had right away was the plastic clips on the lid. Putting the lid on and off just 3 times, which also meant I was bending the clips back and forth, resulted in plastic stress to the clips (see photo). Over the years, I have owned many products that have a similar design, and I do not expect this part to last too long, but BeanSafe tells me that they have been tested “400,000 times for durability”, so only time will tell how well they hold up.  They do recommend that you treat the clips gently for a longer life. I would also like to see container manufacturers put some sort of soft anti-skid material on the bottom. Metal containers can slide around easily on a tile kitchen counter, and the metal on tile sound hurts the ear. It’s not a big deal, but it would be a nice touch. I would also like to see a way to securely store the scoop with the canister. ### Conclusion At approximately $25 street price for food-grade stainless steel and $20 for BPA-free polypropylene, the BeanSafe Coffee Storage Containers are an affordable, aesthetically pleasing alternative to other products on the market. They make a great upgrade if you are currently using non-valved storage for your coffee. ### Resources_The BeanSafe Coffee Storage Container is no longer available for sale._[How to Store Coffee Beans (Tips and Recommendations)](https://ineedcoffee.com/how-to-store-coffee-beans-tips-and-recommendations/) – Our article on storing coffee beans.

# Avoiding Plastic – 3 Stainless Steel Electric Kettle Options [Brewing Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/brewing-coffee/)---by [Michael Allen Smith](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/michael-allen-smith/)![Avoiding Plastic – 3 Stainless Steel Electric Kettle Options](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/avoiding-plastic-3-stainless-steel-electric-kettle-options/avoiding-plastic.jpg)_**This article is a few years old now. A lot has changed since then.**_ I might have been the last person to get this memo: > Hot Water + Plastic = Bad Why is this bad? There are at least two reasons: 1. Imparts bad taste to beverages 2. Estrogens I will confess that I’ve never tasted any _plastic-like qualities_ in the tea or French press coffees I’ve made using my trusty [plastic electric kettle](https://ineedcoffee.com/extending-the-life-of-your-bodum-cordless-electric-kettle/). However, I’ve learned that the best tasters in both tea and coffee can taste the plastic. They use stainless steel electric kettles to heat their water. **If it were just a taste issue and I was happy with the taste of my beverages, I would still be using a plastic kettle.** Estrogens are a different story – they motivated me to research stainless steel kettle options. In the book _The Warrior Diet_, author Ori Hofmekler lays out the case against dietary and environmental estrogens. I won’t cover his book here; you can find my review, Revisiting The Warrior Diet, on my personal site. What Ori said about plastics grabbed my attention. He stated that compounds in plastic called plasticizers can be estrogenic and carcinogenic (EX, bisphenol A). When I started going through all the different types of plastic, which were bad and less bad, my head started to spin. I didn’t understand the chemistry, but I knew what I had to do to minimize estrogenic exposure – **I decided to replace my plastic kettle with a stainless steel one.** I did some research and found three affordable stainless steel electric kettles, each with its own benefits. The 30-ounce _Adagio Teas 3 UtiliTEA_ runs for about $50. It has three different temperature settings and is ideal for a tea drinker. Black teas require a hotter brew temperature than oolongs. Green and white teas require even lower temperatures. I emailed the company and asked if the hot water made any contact with plastic. They responded: > There is a plastic view window in the utiliTEA; otherwise the rest of the kettle is made of brushed stainless steel.![](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/adagio-kettle.8YqMaApG_Z2qAqjr.webp)*Adagio Teas 3 UtiliTEA Variable-Temperature 30-Ounce Electric Kettle * The _Breville SK500XL_ runs about $70 and can heat almost 58 ounces of water. I also emailed them to see if the hot water and plastic made contact. They responded: > There is a plastic volume gauge that is exposed to hot water on the kettle.![](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/breville-kettle-1.jrlMeNLn_Z1pfjVb.webp)*Breville SK500XL Ikon Cordless 1.7-Liter Stainless-Steel Electric Kettle * The _Hamilton Beach 40898 Cool Touch Tea Kettle_ costs about $60 and can heat 64 ounces. Hot water and plastic do not contact this kettle, as this model does not have a plastic window for the user to see the water level. ### And The Winner Is? It was tough to decide between the three models. I liked Adagio’s three temperature settings because I am a tea drinker who favors oolong and green tea. The Breville had some great comments and a stable base. In the end, I went with the Hamilton Beach Cool Touch. It has the largest capacity and no plastic contact. Having a plastic window gauge is not important to me.![](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/hamilton-beach-kettle.DHo7JtJf_Z2otpi1.webp)*Hamilton Beach 40898 Cool-Touch Cordless 8-Cup Electric Kettle * My full review of the [Hamilton Beach Cool Touch Tea Kettle](https://ineedcoffee.com/the-hamilton-beach-cool-touch-tea-kettle-review/). ### Resources [Revisiting the Warrior Diet](https://criticalmas.org/2009/04/revisiting-the-warrior-diet/) – My review of Ori Hofmekler’s book.

# Battle of the Handheld Espresso Makers: Handpresso Wild Hybrid vs Wacaco Minipresso GR [Espresso](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/espresso/)---by [Chris Arnold](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/chris-arnold/)![Battle of the Handheld Espresso Makers: Handpresso Wild Hybrid vs Wacaco Minipresso GR](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/battle-handheld-espresso-makers-handpresso-wild-hybrid-vs-wacaco-minipresso-gr/battle-espresso-makers.jpg) The 21st century has arrived, and now you can take espresso to work, camping, travel, or anywhere on the go. These hand-powered portable espresso makers promise a very small footprint without the need for electricity or cartridges, all at a very reasonable price. Add hot water and some finely ground coffee, and you are ready. Both the Handpresso Wild Hybrid and Wacaco Minipresso GR units work on human power to make enough pressure to produce espresso, but can they produce the same quality as a commercial espresso machine? And how do they compare to each other? Read on to find out. ### Handpresso Wild Hybrid The Handpresso Wild looks somewhat like a small bicycle pump, which consists of 3 parts: the main body, coffee basket, and a locking cover. It produces a maximum of 232 PSI (16bar) and has a 2-year warranty. The dimensions are approximately 8.5 x 4 x 2.75 inches (220 x 100 x 70 mm) and weighs about 17 ounces (480g). The Handpresso Wild Hybrid has a street price of about $120.![Handpresso Wild Hybrid](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/DSC01449-650x366.BVH58uUv_26OQqL.webp)_Handpresso Wild Hybrid_ There is a .25oz (7g) filter basket that you fill with finely ground coffee, and the end of the pump is used as a tamper. There is also a water chamber that holds 1.7oz (50ml), which you fill to the line with hot water, placing the basket in between the water chamber and lid, which is locked by twisting it shut.![Handpresso Wild Hybrid](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/DSC01452-650x601.BDKGr2P4_15584p.webp)_Handpresso Wild Hybrid has just three parts_ You add pressure to the chamber by pumping it up several times until the pressure gauge indicates you are in the correct range. The pressure is maintained until you are ready to release it with a switch, which pushes the water through the coffee and into the cup.**NOTE:** _The unit does support E.S.E. pods, but that was not tested as part of this review._![Handpresso Wild Hybrid](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/DSC01454-650x461.C6d-zY30_WGYyy.webp)_The Handpresso Wild Hybrid provides 232 PSI (16bar) of max pressure and a nice gauge for visual confirmation._### Wacaco Minipresso GR The Minipresso GR looks a lot like a small thermos, which consists of 6 parts: the main body, coffee basket, water chamber, locking cover, coffee scoop, and lid/cup combo. It produces an average of 116 PSI (8bar) and has a 1-year warranty. The dimensions are approximately 7 x 3 x 2.5 inches (175 x 70 x 60 mm) and weighs about 13 ounces (360g). The Minipresso has a street price of about $60.![Minipresso GR](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/DSC01455-431x650.DiEbjtON_Zl4OoO.webp) *Wacaco Minipresso GR * There is a .25oz (7g) filter basket that you fill with finely ground coffee and tamp with the bottom of the scoop. The coffee scoop is also nice because it allows you to measure the exact amount of coffee needed, and also seals perfectly with the coffee basket so that you can simply place the two together, and flip them over to fill the basket with minimal mess.![Minipresso GR](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/DSC01456-650x447.CQViejB5_Z1VQnz3.webp)_Wacaco Minipresso GR has six parts that fit together in a streamlined shape_ There is also a water chamber that holds 2.3oz (70ml), that you fill to the line with hot water, screwing it underneath the main body which locks it in. Unlike the Handpresso, the Minipresso does not allow you to “pre-pump” the unit with pressure. Instead, each pump forces water through the coffee and into the cup. The pump piston lever locks in place when not in use, which maintains its svelte shape.![Minipresso GR](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/DSC01462-463x650.BCFsqNVv_Z2bM3k8.webp)_The Wacaco Minipresso GR’s stout piston lever provides the pressure needed for espresso._### Comparison Both the Handpresso GR and Minipresso GR produce a decent cup of espresso with some crema. In my tests, I used a lightly roasted Ethiopian Harrar about 4 days off the roast. The flavor was respectable in both cases, and I would say I preferred the flavor from the Handpresso, even though it produced less visible crema. The resulting coffee temperature from the Minipresso was a little lower than that from the Handpresso, but I did not preheat the unit. Wacaco recommends a preheat cycle, but this involves running hot water through the unit, and I didn’t want to go through that process.![Minipresso Espresso](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/DSC01485-650x496.BAaH4go6_Za2f7q.webp)_Espresso from the Wacaco Minipresso GR_![Handpresso Espresso](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/DSC014771-650x478.CrO_dBOU_2v1XCM.webp)_Espresso from the Handpresso Wild Hybrid_![Izzo Alex Duetto III Espresso](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/DSC014811-650x488.B1LhZc-A_2evcM3.webp)_Espresso from the Izzo Alex Duetto III_ The Minipresso has more plastic parts, and they are a little thinner. The Handpresso uses a lot more metal, and the plastic it does use seems to be thicker. However, both units are well-made and have a solid feel. I expect either unit would hold up well and survive normal abuse like dropping them or overseas traveling. The Handpresso shape is not very streamlined and feels a little imbalanced. You cannot store it upright, and it requires more room to store than the Minipresso. If I were taking one of these hiking or on a road trip, I would probably opt for the Minipresso because of the shorter, more bullet-like shape, and the ability to place it easily in a cup holder or bottle holder in a backpack. If I were taking this in luggage or regular camping, I would likely take the Handpresso because of the slightly better flavor, ability to store the pressure, and only having 3 parts to keep track of. ### Tamping and Cleanup The Handpresso works best when [tamping coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/espresso-tamping/) using the end of the pump handle, and the Minipresso with the bottom of the scoop. Considering the small basket size of each, these tamping implements are more than adequate. The cleanup on the Handpresso was very simple. Emptying and cleaning just the coffee basket was all that was needed most of the time, with an occasional rinse of the locking cover. With the Minipresso, I felt I had to clean inside the main body, lock the cover, and empty/clean the coffee basket every time. ### Conclusion Neither unit produced quite the quality I get out of my Prosumer Izzo Alex Duetto III, but then again, that is a $2500 machine that uses electricity and has a fairly large footprint.  I would have been thrilled to have either one of these on a previous trip to the UK, where finding decent espresso was hit or miss. The **Wacaco Minipresso GR** is good for those who value: - A lower price point - A smaller, more streamlined shape and balanced feel - An included cup for an all-in-one package The **Handpresso Wild Hybrid** is good for those who value: - Better flavor - Higher max pressure - Easier cleanup - The simplicity of just three parts - Ability to use ESE pods_Disclosure: INeedCoffee was sent some of these products at no cost, which did not affect its review._ Published on August 28, 2017--- #### Chris Arnold Chris is the creator of Two Bit History.

# Home Roasting Coffee (BBQ Style) [Roasting Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/roasting-coffee/)---by [Kevin Gilhooly](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/kevin-gilhooly/)![Home Roasting Coffee (BBQ Style)](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/barbeque-coffee/pizzapan450.jpg) I have been meaning to try roasting my own beans for quite a while, but the one issue that frightened me the most was “smoke.” It’s mentioned in all the roasting articles here, so there seemed no way around it. I’m from Texas, so we’re used to cooking outdoors. So, I simply replaced the oven and stove in the basic roasting recipes with my Weber gas grill. Here was my logic: it’s gas, it’s controllable heat (three burners with separate controls), and it has a visible thermostat. Most importantly (especially to my wife), it’s outdoors, so smoke becomes less of an issue. I had some Colombian Supremo beans I had purchased online, so this weekend, I decided it was time to roast.![green coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/green4501.CAgFI550_rToVh.webp)_Green Coffee_ I followed the [Home Roasting Coffee with the Whirley-Pop Popcorn Popper](https://ineedcoffee.com/stovetop-roasting-with-the-whirley-pop/) article and just placed the Whirley-Pop on the gas grill, rather than the stove. This produced a fairly light roast after about twenty minutes. I heard the first crack but never heard the second. I don’t think the heat was enough to roast the coffee much more than that. This also took a lot longer than I thought it would which is probably a temperature issue, as well.![roasting coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/popper450.Cjcl8E3N_Z27mIyR.webp)_Roasting Coffee_ One drawback of this method is that you have to keep the lid of the grill open all the time. Since the gas grill needs the lid closed to generate higher temperatures, this is an issue. After I declared the roast “done”, I moved the beans to a metal colander and shook them to cool and remove the chaff. The next day, I decided to try the [Home Roasting Coffee in an Oven](https://ineedcoffee.com/home-roasting-coffee-in-an-oven/) method, replacing the oven with the grill. I used a pizza pan as in the recipe, got the grill up to 500 degrees per the thermostat, placed the tray on the grill, and closed the lid. I adjusted the three burners to keep the thermostat at 500 degrees during the roast. At about six minutes, I heard the first crack. I would check the beans each minute after that, boosting the gas after I closed the lid to get the temperature back up to 500. After about twelve minutes, I declared the roast “done”. I used a pair of pliers to remove the pizza pan from the grill and poured the beans into a metal colander for cooling (and to remove the chaff as before.) My wife helped with this step – it would be very useful to have a helper along for this part. Pouring hot beans off a round pan into a colander can be tricky.![BBQ Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/pizzapan450.BUwVYRhW_Z21qk0A.webp)_BBQ Coffee_ Warning to pet owners – coffee is harmful to dogs, so make sure you pour the beans into the colander and remove the chaff somewhere where they aren’t, in the case of any spills. I went out on our driveway to pour the beans into the colander and shake it to cool. In both cases, I waited about an hour to remove the beans from the colander and placed them in an air-tight container to wait for grinding and brewing. The pizza pan produced much richer coffee than the popcorn popper, but I am fairly certain that’s because the heat was so much higher and it reached the second crack stage. You could see oil on the beans from the pan, but not so much from the popper. Both made very good coffee, but I prefer the pizza pan method’s flavor. (I think the next time, I will remove the beans at about ten minutes to compare the outcome.) So, if you don’t want to fill your house with smoke, and you have a gas grill and a perforated pan, I recommend barbequing your beans!

# Before and After: The Coffee Flavoring Debate [Brewing Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/brewing-coffee/)---by [CB Miller](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/cb-miller/)![Before and After: The Coffee Flavoring Debate](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/before-and-after-the-coffee-flavoring-debate/coffee-flavoring-debate.jpg) Among the many variables that contribute to the taste of specialty coffees, flavorings are perhaps the most controversial. Many companies offer beans that have been pre-flavored – rendering many of the original attributes of the beans indistinguishable from the added flavors. When you purchase pre-flavored coffees you cannot be sure that underneath it all, you have actually received the best beans available. Our philosophy and our recommendation are that if you desire to flavor your coffee, you should do so with the many quality syrups that are available. Add these syrups -such as vanilla, chocolate, mint, and others, after the coffee has been brewed and poured into the cup. Pre-flavored coffee is made with potent oils, which will permanently stain your coffee maker. You may find though, that these syrups are not available in quantities suitable for home use. Another alternative we would suggest is the use of natural spices and fruits. Cinnamon, nutmeg, nuts, and even orange zest can be ground with the beans before brewing. Begin with minute amounts and then, after trial and error, increase the amounts incrementally if needed.![flavored coffee syrups](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/flavored-coffee-syrups1.DVlc10US_ZGoX3H.webp)_Photo of flavor syrups by Keo 101 (inactive Flickr user)_ However you flavor your coffee, do so gently so as not to overwhelm the subtle characteristics that originally appealed to you. Recognize as well that not all beans tolerate all flavors. Central American coffees, for example, are generally well balanced and amenable to most added flavorings. Heavier Indonesian coffees and others work best with stronger flavorings like chocolate or liquors. Again, be respectful of the beans you buy; don’t drown them in syrups and spices. ### Resources [Naturally Flavored Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/naturally-flavored-coffee/) – INeedCoffee article on natural ways to flavor your coffee.

# Backcountry Coffee Redux [Brewing Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/brewing-coffee/)---by [Matt Evans](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/matt-evans/)![Backcountry Coffee Redux](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/backcountry-coffee-redux/camping-coffee-making.jpg) As an avid backpacker and backcountry enthusiast from the caffeine-soaked streets of the northwest, I have searched high and low for an easy way to make great coffee away from the conveniences of home. Coffee-making gadgets range from the ineffective to the bizarre, but mostly they’re just bulky and heavy. There’s no use whittling away ounces by moving to an alcohol stove or shortening up your sleeping pad if you’re just going to throw in a three-pound coffee pot. So it would seem that the backpacker trying to lighten his or her load is left with some kind of instant coffee concentrate or the age-old cowboy method. Well, for anyone who gags at the thought of instant crystals, or thinks that tossing your elegantly roasted, carefully ground beans into a vat of boiling water is akin to throwing a seasoned, aged, filet mignon into the microwave, I have great news. There is another way. While trying to avoid the weak flavor of freeze-dried crystals or liquid concentrate on the one hand and the additional weight of a coffee-making gizmo on the other, I stumbled across two outstanding ways of brewing cafe-quality coffee, no matter how far off the grid your travels take you.![backcountry coffee camping](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/backcountry-coffee-camping1.C9fPbM9x_Z1qDSKi.webp)_Backcountry Coffee Camping_ First, for the easiest, hassle-free delicious cup of mountain jo, the pour-over drip technique wins the prize. To achieve great coffee, simply put ground coffee in a cone (the O.D. Compact Dripper from MontBell weighs in at 0.14 oz), place it over your camp cup, pour water just off the boil over the top, and a few minutes later, you have a steaming hot cup of perfectly extracted coffee. For clean-up, all you have to do is scatter the wet grounds across a wide area and rinse the cone with a splash of water. This works best for one or two morning sippers.![Making Coffee while Camping](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/camping-coffee-making.B3xgsxqV_1ynkvY.webp)_Making Coffee While Camping_ For a group or those that need a Venti to get going in the morning, the Press-Bot from ventureDesignworks (weighing only 2 oz) and a 32 oz _Nalgene_ are all you need. With a half cup of coarse-ground coffee in the bottle (it’s probably best to use a BPA-free bottle since hot water is what causes the bad stuff to leach out), slip the Press Bot in and lock the plunger flat. Next while holding the plunger filter at a diagonal, pour water just off the boil in until the grounds and water reach the top, then screw the top on. After five minutes, slowly push the plunger down to separate the grounds from the steeped coffee. Now you’ve got 32 oz of fabulous coffee to serve your whole party or keep for yourself. The Lexan bottle also keeps your second cup amazingly hot, even at altitude. This clean-up is even easier. If you don’t need that bottle for the way down, just screw the cap on and toss it in your pack. If you want to re-use the _Nalgene_ for more water, sling the grounds over a wide area and rinse the remaining sludge with a splash of water. Both of these methods will yield you coffee worthy of a specialty cafe for less than twenty dollars and a few extra ounces.

He ended up in Alaska, finally finding a home where he can pursue his love for family, the outdoors, and flying all in the same place.

# Before There Was Tea, There Was Coffee [Coffee History](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/coffee-history/)---by [Paul Teverow](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/paul-teverow/)![Before There Was Tea, There Was Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/before-there-was-tea-there-was-coffee/coffeehouse2_450.jpg) ### The era of English coffeehouses For almost 100 years, coffee was the hot beverage of choice in England, and, unlike the English family’s tea of the last 200 years, it was not consumed at the breakfast table or indeed at any other time or place in the home. Instead, from about the mid-1600s through the mid-1700s, men (and just about all pictures from the period show only men in coffeehouses) drank their coffee in London’s coffeehouses while they transacted business, discussed politics and shared literary works in progress. By 1700, there were probably over 2000 coffeehouses in London or one for every 300 inhabitants. The diary of Samuel Pepys (1633-1701), which reveals so much about Restoration London (not to mention intimate details of his own life), also testifies to the importance of its coffeehouses. Even though London’s first coffeehouse did not open until 1652, less than 10 years later, coffeehouses had become the favored social venue for Pepys and other members of the Restoration elite. Indeed, in just the second week of his diary entries (which began in January 1660), Pepys reports meeting friends and discussing politics in coffee houses. Coffee houses, along with the theater, became an integral part of Restoration London’s social scene. When in 1667, King Charles II’s celebrated mistress, Nell Gwyn, appeared in a comedy entitled _The Coffee-house_, Pepys found the performance sold out. Ten days later, Pepys and his wife were invited to a special performance of the play at the home of the Duke of York, the King’s brother and Lord High Admiral. Pepys reported it to be “the most ridiculous, insipid play that ever I saw in my life.” [15 October 1667]![coffee house](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/coffeehouse4501.pKl8YsEa_1cMRpP.webp) An important official in the bureaucracy of the Royal Navy (thus the connection with the Duke of York), Pepys met frequently at coffee houses to review the Navy’s finances and draw up contracts. He also visited coffee houses to enjoy the company of other movers and shakers (including the poet John Dryden and the composer Henry Purcell [father of the more famous Purcell]) and to discuss topics ranging from the war with the Dutch Republic to James Harrington’s political theory to the reproductive systems of insects. On one occasion, he left a coffee house after a long discussion of the booming Restoration economy only to return shortly thereafter with a friend, “and there drunk more till I was almost sick” (23 January 1663) As Wolfgang Schivelbush has noted, for people to gather over a stimulating rather than intoxicating beverage marked nothing less than a revolution in European foodways. In 1674, an anonymous poet favorably compared coffee with the more traditional English beverage of choice: > _When foggy Ale, leavying up mighty trains Of muddy vapours, had beseig’d our Brains, Then Heaven in Pity … First sent amongst us this All-healing Berry (quoted in Schivelbush, 34)_ Not everyone agreed that coffee was a blessing for England. Because, at this time, nearly all coffee was imported from the Ottoman Empire, some saw the coffee bean as a “Mahometan berry” that would undermine not only traditional English ale but also Christian values. One pamphleteer argued that the coffee craze was damaging the English economy by lowering demand for grain, the chief ingredient of ale and beer. He also complained that too many shopkeepers and tradesmen were neglecting their businesses for coffee shops, “where, meeting friends, they have sat talking three or four hours, after which, a fresh acquaintance appearing, and so one after another all day long, hath begotten fresh discourse, so that frequently they have staid five or six hours together.” In 1674, some London wives echoed this concern in a petition that complained of the hours that husbands wasted in coffee houses. In addition, they warned, coffee caused impotence and “made men as unfruitful as the deserts whence that unhappy berry is said to be brought.” [quoted in Shelley]![coffee in early England](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/coffeehouse2_450.6DOy72RR_26Qbet.webp) A 1673 pamphlet entitled _The Character of a Coffee-House_ compared the appearance and flavor of coffee to “Pluto’s diet-drink, that witches tipple out of dead men’s skulls.” The typical coffeehouse, the author alleged, “stinks of tobacco worse than hell of brimstone.” [The pictures below invariably show the patrons of coffee houses with tobacco pipes.] The beverage itself was served in filthy pots and dishes, the landlord only occasionally “scraping off the contracted soot”, which he then simply substituted for ground coffee, “their taste and virtue being so near of kin, he dares defy the veriest coffee-critic to distinguish them.” Above all, the author condemned coffee houses as dens of subversion, where the social classes promiscuously mingled and spread the rumors published in gazettes and pamphlets, where “every little fellow in a camlet [a kind of outerwear] takes upon him to transpose affairs both in church and state, to shew reasons against acts of parliament, and condemn the decrees of general councils.” It was precisely such fears that led the government to suppress coffee houses by royal proclamation in 1675. However, the suppression seems not to have been enforced because the number of coffeehouses continued to grow over the 1670s and 80s. Of course, coffee houses had their defenders as well as critics. _Coffee-Houses Vindicated_ (1675), served as a brief for the defense against _The Character of a Coffee-House_. Far from being unhealthy, the author asserted, coffee serves as an “incomparable remedy to dissolve crudities, comfort the brain, and dry up ill humors in the stomach.” It can prevent or cure “all cold drowsy rheumatic distempers whatsoever, that proceed from excess of moisture,” which excess, of course, can hardly be avoided in England. And although, the author acknowledged, Englishmen might at first find the taste strange, “this drink has nothing in it of nauseousness, nor any taste but what, familiarised by a little use, will become pleasant and delightful.” It was also more economical to visit a coffeehouse than an alehouse. At the latter, the proprietor pressured the customer to keep paying for pots of ale, whereas in the coffeehouse, “for a penny or two, you may spend two or three hours, have the shelter of a house, the warmth of a fire, the diversion of company … and all this without any grumbling or repining.” Just as the author of _The Character of a Coffee-House_ focused above all on coffee’s potential to subvert the government, family, and industry, so his protagonist responded by praising the social virtues of the coffee house, as opposed to the tavern or alehouse: “Where can young gentlemen, or shop-keepers, more innocently and advantageously spend an hour or two in the evening, than at a coffee-house? Where they shall be sure to meet company, and, by the custom of the house, not such as at other places, stingy and reserved to themselves, but free and communicative…”![coffeeshop debate](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/debate250.BOcuvdxE_k2xv1.webp) He also rejected his opponent’s depiction of coffee house patrons as idle and coarse. Rather, he argued, the coffee house had already raised the level of public discourse: “as you have here the most civil, so it is, generally, the most intelligent society; the frequenting whose converse, and observing their discourses and deportment, cannot but civilize our manners, enlarge our understandings, refine our language, teach us a generous confidence and handsome mode of address…” This defense of the coffee house celebrates new “middle-class” virtues of sobriety and refined sociability. It also argues for the unique compatibility of coffee with the booming commercial economy of Restoration London. Here too, the author asserts the advantages of the coffee house over the tavern. Virtually all business negotiations, he noted, seemed to be conducted “at some public house.” It can be disastrous for businessmen to conclude contracts “at taverns or alehouses, where continual sippings, though never so warily, would be apt to fly up into their brains and render them drowsy and indisposed for business.” “A dish or two of coffee”, by contrast, is “so far from causing, that it cures any dizziness or disturbant fumes.” Thus, the businessmen “dispatching their business, go out more sprightly about their affairs than before…” The link between coffee and business became even stronger than the author could have imagined. The famous essayist Richard Steele (1672-1729), the editor of _The Tatler_, listed its business address as the Grecian coffee house. In the late 1600s, a coffee house owned by one Edward Lloyd became a meeting place for merchants, ship owners, ship captains, insurance brokers, and others involved in overseas trade. Because so many of his customers came to hear the latest business news, Mr. Lloyd began publishing the news in his own periodical. Soon, he was making more from his newsletter than from his coffee. Insurance brokers, in particular, found his services so useful that they began meeting their clients at his coffee house, and soon they were renting booths in his shop. Even after Edward Lloyd’s death in 1713, insurance brokers continued to meet at the coffee house. By 1774, Lloyd’s had become a corporation owned by brokers and underwriters and had moved its quarters to the Royal Exchange. By then, of course, tea had begun to supplant coffee. For a crucial century, though, the growth of England’s commerce and the emergence of a large, politically aware middle class in London are intimately connected with coffee and coffee houses. ### Sources_The Character of a Coffee-House_ (1673), in _Coffee-Houses Vindicated_ (1675), in Edward Potts Cheyney, _Readings in English History_ (1908) and in Paul Halsall, _Internet Modern History Sourcebook_ [www.fordham.edu/halsall/mod/modsbook.html](http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/mod/modsbook.html) (site down December 2014).

# Behmor 1600 Coffee Roaster Tutorial [Roasting Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/roasting-coffee/)---by [Chris Arnold](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/chris-arnold/)![Behmor 1600 Coffee Roaster Tutorial](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/behmor-1600-coffee-roaster-tutorial/behmor7.jpg) In my last article, I wrote my first impression of the Behmor 1600, formerly known as the Joe Roaster, the brainchild of Joe Behm. After spending a few more weeks with it, I have learned more about it, and I hope to help you get the most from your Behmor 1600 Coffee Roaster. If you are too lazy to read the entire article, I will say that at a street price of around $300, I can recommend this roaster. But there are some caveats, and to get the most from the Behmor roaster, you will need to read on.![behmor1600-roaster](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/behmor1600-roaster-650x434.D1tEzpHs_2sOt3q.webp)_Behmor Coffee Roaster_### Batch Size First things first. After a lot of experimenting, I found the optimum batch size to be about 9 ounces, especially for my typical voltage of 115 AC. Smaller batches were more erratic, and larger batches sometimes never reached 2nd crack, even when I maxed out the total roast time to 23:00 minutes. Stick with 8-10 ounces, and you will have the best results. ### Voltage Pretty much all the electric roasters of the consumer caliber are sensitive to swings in voltage. Using your voltage monitor of choice (I like to use a Kill a Watt), you can potentially adjust your batch size up or down a bit and perhaps use a more or less aggressive profile. This is something that will take trial and error, but if you secure several pounds of the same bean and keep a good roasting log, you should be getting repeatable results in no time – and giving away a lot of coffee. ### Profiles and Settings There are 5 Roasting Profile Curves that are pre-defined. You cannot create your own, or customize the existing ones. However, you can use the graphs presented in the manual to help select the correct profile for your bean and voltage at the time. Profile 2 is probably the most _interesting_. Take a look at the manual, and you will see what I mean. Typically though I used P3 or P4, depending on the bean and voltage. The others just didn’t work for me (crack problems mentioned below) and were probably due to my low-ish voltage. The different pound settings (1/4lb, 1/2lb, 1lb) will allow you more max time, but they also change the different segments a bit. I always use the 1 pound setting, that way I can have as much or as little time as I need. Experimentation is needed in this area. If you want to see one of my sample profiles, scroll down. ### Roasting The roast is even, and it seems to be a very steady, slower roast in general, which is in line with the published profile graphs. The agitation is pretty good, and I am sure that contributed to the even roasting. What I found when experimenting was that sometimes the first crack and the second crack ran together, other times it never arrived. Once I was dialed in, 1st crack and 2nd crack were about 2-3 minutes apart, with a total roast time of about 18-20 minutes; exactly what I was looking for. ### Dumping and Cooling The cooling cycle of the Behmor, if left to its own devices, is about 13 minutes. Most seasoned coffee roasters like to watch their roast, and when the desired roast level is achieved, stop the roast and cool the beans ASAP. ASAP means 30 seconds, 1 minute, basically as quickly as possible. You can get close to that with the Behmor. The trick is to allow the cooling cycle to kick in, and after 2 minutes, open the door (the 2 minutes allows the electronics and such to cool down, prolonging the machine’s life). At this point, you can let it continue with the door open. In this case, the beans will be completely cool in about 3-4 more minutes (5-6 minutes total). This means you will need to stop the roast somewhat earlier and guess how the roast will “coast” to your desired roast level. The other option is to simply pull the drum after 2 minutes with gloves on and dump them into a big colander over a fan (or whatever your cooling method of choice is). I am lazy, and have been doing the former, but will soon be doing the latter.![behmor1600-open-roaster](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/behmor1600-open-roaster-650x434.tMjenKjH_Z2denlC.webp)_Behmor 1600_### Cleaning and Maintenance The chaff collector works well, and there is usually a small handful of chaff remaining inside the machine. I suggest buying a wide paintbrush from Home Depot or your local hardware store. The chaff can be swept into the chaff collector, which incidentally, fits very snugly into the front door once pulled out. This makes for almost seamless sweeping from inside the chamber to the collector. As recommended in the manual, after five roasts, run an empty cycle. This will keep oils and debris to a minimum and keep your roaster in tip-top shape. Also, check the drum. You will find that with smaller or inconsistent beans (like a lot of Ethiopians I used, or Yemenis, for that matter), there will be a few that get stuck in the holes of the drum. Apparently, the stock drum provided with my unit is not really meant for the smaller or inconsistent bean types. If you do have to use the stock drum with these “odd” beans and they do get stuck, the only way to get them out is to lightly tap them with a heavy object like a small hammer. This forces them to the inside of the drum and breaks them apart, which allows for easy disposal of the fragments. It should be noted that another problem is that small beans can fall through the drum into the bottom of the roaster, which can increase the smoke early on. Needless to say, the manufacturer does not recommend using the smaller beans with the stock drum. It looks like there will be a second drum option to address these issues. One partial workaround is to spin the drum by hand over a bowl or something and allow any of the small beans to fall through before putting the drum in the machine and starting the roast. Lastly, wipe the inside of the glass window frequently. Sometimes, oils can fog up the window, making it hard to see the beans as they roast. ### Flavor I have roasted Brazilian, Ethiopian, and Island coffees, all with nice results. This machine really works well for espresso. As with many drum-like profiles, the flavors are slightly more rounded off and sweet, which is great for espresso. For drip or [French Press](https://ineedcoffee.com/press-pot-tutorial/), it still does a good job, but I like a brighter roast for these preparations. The Fresh Roast is the perfect companion for that job. ### Tips 1. Monitor voltage using a Kill-A-Watt. This will help you pick the best profile and time. 2. When roasting inside, you might want to start out under the oven hood with the fan on high. Depending on the profiles you use, the bean selection, and the degree of roast you choose, you may or may not experience visible smoke. This roaster is designed with an afterburner, attempts to minimize smoke as much as possible, and does an admirable job. 3. To help with placing the drum, which can be a bit tricky, start by turning the light on. Now, start placing the drum inside and hug the top of the roof. Now tilt the right side down so that the keyed shaft slides in, and then drop the un-keyed left side down, and you are done. 4. Experiment! Get lots of the same bean (5 pounds or more), a KillaWatt, and keep a good roast log. That will be your best chance of success. ### Chris’ Sample Profile - 9 ounces Brazil Daterra Yellow Bourbon - 115VAC With no load (dropping to about 111 or 112 volts when the heating element kicked in) - 1 pound setting (set to 20 minutes) - 1st crack at 16:00, 2nd crack at about 18:30 - I started watching Roast around the 15-minute mark, and hit the cool button at about 19 minutes. - Very Sweet Espresso as a Single Origin Shot ### ![behmor1600-green-coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/behmor1600-green-coffee-650x434.DDZgob_n_1vNLn1.webp) ### Conclusion The Behmor Roaster is built very well. It is priced well below its nearest competition – The GeneCafe and the Hottop. I personally will keep something like an iRoast or Fresh Roast in my arsenal for those times I want a brighter roast, and the Behmor will be my main espresso roaster. ### Resources [Behmor 1600 Coffee Roaster – First Impression](https://ineedcoffee.com/behmor-1600-coffee-roaster-first-impression/) – INeedCoffee article.

# Behmor 1600 Coffee Roaster – First Impression [Roasting Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/roasting-coffee/)---by [Chris Arnold](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/chris-arnold/)![Behmor 1600 Coffee Roaster – First Impression](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/behmor-1600-coffee-roaster-first-impression/behmor7.jpg) Maybe you’ve been hearing about the new roaster by Joe Behm. Maybe you heard it under other names, like the Joe Roaster. Maybe you have been hearing about it for so long, that you actually forgot about its existence. Well, the _Behmor 1600_ (official name) has arrived. At the SCAA show in May 2007, this roaster was awarded the prize for _Best New Product_. I have given it a cursory look, and hope to share some of my initial findings with you. The first thing I thought when using the Behmor was: This thing is quiet, and it is pretty small. And those are both true even after 2 weeks with the machine. The quiet part is a boon to anyone that wishes to listen for 1st or 2nd crack. A small footprint is always a good thing for obvious reasons.![behmor1600-roaster](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/behmor1600-roaster-650x434.D1tEzpHs_2sOt3q.webp)_Behmor Coffee Roaster_### Roasting I selected Brazil Daterra Yellow Bourbon, and Malawi Mapanga as my Green Coffee Bean selection. I found that 10 ounces was my batch size of choice, and resulted in about 8 ounces of roasted coffee after moisture loss. I tried all profiles initially using the 1/2 pound setting. There were some problems though. Some profiles (P1 and P2) roasted so quickly that the first and second cracks ran together towards the end. Other profiles (P3, P4, P5) simply did not give me enough time to get into the second crack (the longest time allowed was 15 minutes). There was nothing I could do about P1 and P2 since the profiles were already programmed in, so I did not use those at all. However, with P3, P4, and P5, I felt I just needed 2-3 minutes more, because I had ended, or was nearing the end of the first crack at the 15-minute mark. I realized eventually that just selecting the 1 pound setting allowed me much more time, and does not change anything other than the max allowed time. It turned out that with P3 and P4 I got about 18-minute roasts where I was just coasting into 2nd crack, and there were about 2 minutes between 1st and 2nd crack. P5 for me “baked” the beans a little, so I avoided it. If a roast falls outside the roast time max it can mean low voltage. Try plugging the roaster into a different outlet or trying roasting at a different time of day.![behmor-load-coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/behmor-load-coffee-434x650.C-foqdPo_jqX3J.webp)_Load Green Coffee_![behmor-load-roaster](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/behmor-load-roaster-650x434.KVx8U7I5_Z1UA6po.webp)_Place Inside Roaster_![behmor-roasting](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/behmor-roasting-650x432.CO7t8jan_IVi2A.webp)_Behmor roast in progress_### Cooling The cooling cycle is about 13 minutes. Too long you say?, well I found a trick that works well. After about 2 minutes, just open the door. Everything is cool enough to touch within about another 3-4 minutes, and the first 2 minutes with the door closed allows the electronics to cool down. If you had gloves, you could even pull the drum as soon as you open the door. Either way, cooling is acceptable to me. The chaff collector works well, and there is usually a small handful of chaff leftover inside the machine. I blow out the chaff the old-fashioned way, but there is an optional clean-up brush listed in the manual. Not sure how much that upgrade will run you, but I would think a $.19 wide paintbrush could do the same thing.![behmor-cooloing-coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/behmor-cooloing-coffee-650x434.BTNTksbZ_Z11oV7b.webp)_Open Behmor_### Flavor Once I got the roast where I wanted it, I tested the beans for flavor using both drip and espresso. I have to say the Malawi Mapanga had some berry notes on day 2 that I had never gotten with the GeneCafe or the iRoast2. Overall, the roasts were very nice and somewhat better than my GeneCafe. ### No USB Cable Required Five Roasting Profile Curves are pre-defined and cannot be changed, though they are decent, and graphs are provided in the manual. This roaster is not for the Uber Geeky Coffee Nerd. It is customizable within defined limits. If you run Linux or even know why a PID would have anything to do with coffee equipment, you might want to pass. Or better yet, this might be your opportunity to void the warranty, mod this bad boy, and add Bluetooth and WiFi just for the fun of it.![behmor-roaster-side-controls](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/behmor-roaster-side-controls-434x650.D-6ECNWn_19eyXU.webp)_Behmor control panel_![behmor1600-open-roaster](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/behmor1600-open-roaster-650x434.tMjenKjH_Z2denlC.webp)_Behmor Home Coffee Roaster_![inside the Behmor Coffee Roaster](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/behmor8.Bt-_5d2g_208P3i.webp)_inside the Behmor Coffee Roaster_### Additional Notes The manual is an interesting read, to say the least. It could definitely use a rewrite, but will get you up and running, and explains most of the features. As a guy, I find it easier to use the equipment first and only go to the manual in emergency situations. The drum clasp and lid are not the smoothest things in the world, and in one case the lid was opened “too far”, and I could not get it back without a lot of force. All in all minor, but worth mentioning. Some in the past complained about the loading of the drum. I found it fairly easy after a couple of times, but it takes some getting used to. The cleverly provided light allows you to see the beans without opening the door. However, the viewing glass gets “fogged up” after a few roasts, presumably with coffee oils or moisture. To improve visibility, keep the glass cover cleaned. The only thing the different weight settings do is increase max time for a given Profile (not officially stated anywhere). If you try roasting a second batch after the first batch, none of the buttons respond, nothing happens. In order to roast again, you have to power off first. According to the company, this was done because the unit was not meant for commercial usage and an ordinary customer would rarely need to roast back to back. Smoke-less does not mean what you think. If it said “smokeless”, that would mean without smoke. However, “smoke-less” means that you will get less smoke. Less than what? Not sure, but unless you reach well into 2nd crack, the smoke is very, very minimal. I roast outside, so I cannot comment on whether I would roast in my living room, but I think you could probably roast in your garage without the wife screaming at you (that is for you poor cold weather bastards).![behmor-smokeless](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/behmor-smokeless-650x434.Bq7C3pjr_1lJHw0.webp)_“Smoke-less” Coffee Roaster_### Initial Conclusion The Behmor 1600 Coffee Roaster is most closely compared to a Gene Cafe ($499), at least in resulting flavor, as well as roast and cooling times. Of course, the heat generation and agitation methods are different. I liked the price of the Behmor, and I really liked the resulting roast. At a suggested list price of $399 (resellers will be able to offer it at a substantially lower price), the Behmor 1600 is worth a long, hard look. ### Resources [Behmor 1600 Coffee Roaster Tutorial](https://ineedcoffee.com/behmor-1600-coffee-roaster-tutorial/) – Our follow-up tutorial on the Behmor 1600.

# Best Coffee Grinders Under $100 [Grinding Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/grinding-coffee/)---by [Greg Nolan](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/greg-nolan/)![Best Coffee Grinders Under $100](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/best-coffee-grinders-100/best-coffee-grinders.jpg) Is it possible to get a good coffee grinder for under $100? Not a great coffee grinder, but one that is just good enough to get the task done and not fall apart after a few months of use. I think it can be done. Going from purchasing pre-ground coffee to grinding your own coffee is going to elevate the quality of your home-brewed coffee tremendously. Buying a coffee grinder is well worth the investment. This collection of recommended coffee grinders is for the budget coffee drinker who is not yet ready to commit to a more expensive model. ### Blade vs Burr Coffee Grinders Before we break down the best coffee grinder options, I need to cover the two different types of budget grinders. 1. **Blade grinders are also known as spice grinders.** The beans are aggressively and unevenly chopped in the top chamber. How long you hold the button down determines the grind size. It is very inexact. 2. **Burr Grinders are also known as burr mills.** Unlike the blade grinder, the coffee beans do not enter and exit from the same chamber. Burr grinders use two revolving abrasive surfaces to reduce the size of the coffee bean as they pass. The size is determined by how far apart these two surfaces are. The beans enter the burr, are ground, and once the proper size, the grounds exit the grinder. Blade grinders cost around $20 USD. Burr grinders start around $25 and can go into the thousands for a high-end commercial grinder. ### The Problem With Blade Grinders Many coffee drinkers buy a blade coffee grinder when they first begin grinding their coffee at home. Some coffee beans will be broken into larger chunks, some into smaller chunks, and some pulverized into coffee dust.**You do not want a blade coffee grinder.** When you go to brew your coffee, the larger pieces will be under-extracted and the smaller pieces over-extracted. This can result in a bitter coffee and if you do your best to avoid grinding too small, you risk having a weaker coffee. In many cases, preground coffee from a commercial grinder is going to be better than a blade grinder. It is a trade-off between freshness and proper extraction. Another issue with Blade Grinders is that in some households it does double duty as a spice grinder. This means unless you really clean the grinder thoroughly, you could get some unpleasant flavors the next time you brew. Do you really want to do a spit take of cardamon at 6 AM? ### Hand Coffee Grinders Many hand coffee grinders are priced about the same or a little higher than blade coffee grinders. They do a better job than blade coffee grinders. The bad news is you have to grind the coffee yourself. Your own muscle power. It isn’t hard to grind your own beans with a hand grinder, but it does take time and can be tedious. Most people I’ve talked to hate it at first, but after a week they don’t even think about it. I like hand coffee grinders for the office or for traveling. However, first thing in the morning, I prefer the convenience of electricity. I think hand coffee grinders are fine for making one cup at a time, but if I were making a full pot of coffee daily (or a few times daily), I’d advise getting an electric burr grinder. ### The Best Coffee Coffee Grinders Under $100 #### [$30 – $40: Mr. Coffee Automatic Burr Mill Grinder] If you really want to go budget on an electric burr grinder, there is the classic Mr. Coffee Burr Grinder. It does an admirable job with medium and coarse grinds but fails at the finer grinds. However, if you are comfortable with pulling apart appliances, the Mr. Coffee can be modified to grind for espresso. See the tutorial  [Adjusting the Mr. Coffee Burr Mill for Espresso Grind](https://ineedcoffee.com/adjustable-mr-coffee-burr-mill/) for more details. The Mr. Coffee Burr Mill grinder doesn’t have a reputation for lasting a long time, but given the price point, that is to be expected. This would be a good first grinder for someone very tight on money. A word of warning: these devices can be loud.![Mr Coffee Burr Grinder](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/mr-coffee-burr-grinder500.cqnqs6Ww_Z1iFsiS.webp) *Mr. Coffee Automatic Burr Mill Grinder *#### [$35: Hario Skerton Ceramic Coffee Mill] Hario makes a lot of great coffee equipment, and their hand burr grinder is no exception. The Hario Skerton is the gold standard for hand burr coffee grinders. I’ve seen many other knock-off hand grinders enter and exit the market, but not the Hario. And although it might be a little inconsistent for French Press, it can handle most brewing methods like a champ. Unlike an electric grinder which has settings, you will be responsible for getting your grind size just right. This will take some time and practice. Be patient and remember it is only $35. If you are frequently switching between brewing methods that require different grind sizes, you may want to buy two and then set the burrs perfectly, and then leave them alone.![Hario Skerton Ceramic Coffee Mill ](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/hario-burr-hand-mill.BvQnsbMx_weBCL.webp) *Hario Skerton Ceramic Coffee Mill *#### [$45-$50: Cuisinart DBM-8 Supreme Grind Automatic Burr Mill] At the time of this article, the Cuisinart is the #1 Best Selling Burr Coffee Grinder on Amazon. This makes total sense. With 18 grind settings, it can grind for most brewing methods. The Cuisinart is known for excelling at coarser grinds, so if French Press is your go-to brewing method, this might be the right grinder for you. Cleaning this grinder regularly is advised to prevent jamming and extend the appliance’s life. The Cuisinart also comes with an impressive 18-month warranty.![Cuisinart Coffee Grinder](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/Cusinart-Coffee-Grinder.2o6OQg9H_Z2IaRX.webp) *Cuisinart DBM-8 Supreme Grind Automatic Burr Mill *### [$100: Capresso Infinity Burr Grinder] The Capresso Infinity Burr Grinder is technically $99.95, so it is still under $100. The Infinity has 16 grind settings: 4 each for extra-fine, fine, regular, and coarse. The Infinity is the most sturdy of the sub $100 burr grinders on this list. There are reports of the grinder jamming with darker roasts when ground fine or extra-fine, but this is the best-built coffee grinder under $100.![Capresso Infinity Coffee Grinder](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/capresso-infinity-coffee-grinder.tfNB715l_2pas4f.webp)_Capresso 560.01 Infinity Conical Burr_### Beyond $100 What do you get when you spend more than $100 on a coffee grinder? A few things. - More consistent grind sizes when coarse. - The ability to grind fine enough for espresso or Turkish coffee. - It is better built and will usually last longer. ### Which Budget Coffee Grinder is Best? If you make just a cup or two at a time and don’t mind spending a minute or two hand-grinding, get the Hario Skerton. It is also the best choice for traveling, camping, and kitchens short on extra electrical outlets. If money is tight, go with the Mr. Coffee Burr Mill, especially if it is on sale. The Cuisinart DBM-8 Supreme Grind Automatic Burr Mill is a good grinder at an excellent price. It has a long track record, too. If you prefer to be closer to $50 this is your best burr grinder. Capresso Infinity Conical Burr is sturdy and makes less noise than many other grinders. It will likely outlast the other electric grinders on this list. The Capresso Infinity Conical Burr is the most sturdy of the bunch, makes less noise, and will produce the most consistent grind. If you have $100, get the Infinity. ### Resources [Coffee Grind Chart](https://ineedcoffee.com/coffee-grind-chart/)—Once you have your grinder, this article will help you find the right grind size.

# Bill Clinton: Coffee Achiever [Coffee People](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/coffee-people/)---by [Alex Scofield](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/alex-scofield/)![Bill Clinton: Coffee Achiever](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/bill-clinton-coffee-achiever/byebill.jpg) On the weekend of the U.S. presidential transition, odds are that you have had your fill of Clinton Administration retrospectives. Clinton himself has often seemed obsessed with his historical legacy, while his many detractors have long seemed equally obsessed with making sure that his legacy is a stained one. Although Clinton ran for president as a moderate “New Democrat,” he has always managed to be a polarizing figure, and you have plenty of company if you have an extreme opinion of him as a president or a person. But love him or hate him, if you are a coffee lover, you have something in common with Clinton; he belongs to our coffee-drinking ranks. This weekend, Caffeine Nation’s most notorious citizen will vacate his home of the last eight years at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, Washington, D.C. We at INeedCoffee hope that you can forgive us for adding our retrospective two cents’ worth — it may be a somewhat restricted perspective through which we review Clinton’s presidency, but there is plenty of coffee-related material for us to work with.![Bill Clinton with a cup of coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/bill_handshake1.qDsakszw_2r3F8W.webp)_Bill Clinton with a cup of coffee._### Maxwell White House The departure of a president causes a bureaucratic exodus of sorts, as out with the president go numerous executive appointees, advisers, and other White House personnel. While some Clinton underlings have stayed aboard through the eleventh hour, others have long since moved on to other lines of work. Among those long gone is George Stephanopoulos, who joined the Clinton campaign at the age of 30 in 1991, and served as White House Communications Director and Special Assistant to the President after Clinton’s election. Stephanopoulos chronicled the thrills and agonies of working for the Clinton campaign and White House staff in his autobiographical **All Too Human**. The book is rife with references to coffee, as Stephanopoulos is a Coffee Achiever in his own right, by his own admission scarcely able to function in the morning until the second cup of coffee. Perhaps this is why he had a keen eye for the coffee-drinking habits of Clinton, saying: > I knew the President’s morning routine as well as I knew my own. After stretching on the patio, Clinton would walk through the pantry for a bottle of water and a cup of coffee, then cool down by puttering around his desk or flipping through the newspapers on [secretary] Betty[ Currie]’s credenza. Few journalists have Washington insider credentials that can rival those of Bob Woodward, who with his tag-team partner Carl Bernstein was primarily responsible for exposing the Watergate-related corruption of the Richard Nixon administration in the early 1970s. Woodward’s 1994 book **The Agenda** is an often unflattering look at the 1992 Clinton campaign and the early days of the Clinton White House, during which the President, First Lady, and White House staff receive rude awakenings as to the realities of unleashing their budgetary agenda on a resistant Washington establishment. When Clinton wants to call a few exclusive advisers to a strategy meeting, he chooses the solarium as the location, described in the following passage from **The Agenda**: > The meeting was to be held in the White House solarium, a sun parlor or summer room with bays of glass windows on three sides, perched on top of the White House. Calvin Coolidge’s wife had called a smaller version of the room the “sky parlor,” and President Nixon had called it the California Room. During the 1992 transition, President Reagan had told Clinton that the solarium was his favorite White House room. He had recovered there from his bullet wound after the 1981 assassination attempt, Reagan had explained. For Clinton and his longtime advisers, the room most resembled the informality of the basement of the Arkansas Governor’s Mansion. A kitchenette and a large, PTA-sized coffeepot substituted for servants. The factual Clinton seems to prefer access to a vast coffee reservoir; the fictional Clinton had a similar craving for coffee. I speak, of course, of Jack Staton of the novel Primary Colors. Soon after its publication in 1996, Primary Colors kept the world guessing for months as to the identity of its then-anonymous author, later revealed to be Joe Klein, a frequent writer for the New Yorker. Before Klein confessed to the act, however, it was still obvious that the book was the work of a true insider in the 1992 campaign, and the book, despite its claim to be “a work of fiction and… [n]one of these events ever happened,” was based in very large part Clinton’s road to victory in the Democratic primary and employs only the slimmest of artistic licenses. Stanton, a charismatic southern governor running in the presidential primary who withstands periodic bimbo eruptions and draft-dodging allegations, is a flimsily disguised Bill Clinton. And like the real-life figure he so resembles, Stanton is a coffee drinker. Observe the following exchange between Stanton and Henry Burton, the book’s narrator, and Stanton’s campaign aide: > “Henry, they are going to kill me with trash,” Stanton said the next morning, his face blotchy and reddening, about to blow. “We gotta stop this.” > He looked at me as if it were an assignment: Stop this. Turn back the tide. He looked awful, as if he’d been up all night. He had a cup of coffee in one hand and a doughnut in the other. He inhaled the doughnut. Two bites. ### Coffee With the Constituency For President Clinton, drinking coffee did not always signify another day at the Oval Office. He often got his coffee to go and had it on the road. Several news reporters saw fit to mention when Clinton ordered coffee during his travels about the United States. While we do not know what caliber of coffee he drank in the White House, the following excerpts from a May 1999 [article](https://web.archive.org/web/20140407130307/http://onlineathens.com/stories/051299/new_0512990009.shtml) by Russ Bynum of the Associated Press are evidence that Clinton had at least the occasional taste for the gourmet. > ATLANTA — The downtown market where President Clinton sampled gourmet coffee and sweet-potato cheesecake Tuesday had a hard time five years ago attracting anyone but vagrants with its grimy floors, leaky plumbing and nasty stench… > Clinton used his brief Atlanta trip to talk about a new package of economic incentives aimed at luring investors and big businesses to both inner cities and impoverished rural areas. The president perused rows and rows of vendors selling everything from watermelons and bananas to cow’s feet and ox tails. He sipped Cameroon Boyo coffee at the Kaffee Shop and tried a bite of sweet-potato cheesecake at Sonya Jones’ bakery. > ‘Boy, that’s great,” Clinton said after tasting the dessert. In the same month as this Atlanta trip, a much more tragic occasion brought Bill and Hillary Clinton to Littleton, Colorado, to offer comfort and solace to the grieving family members of the students who had been killed. A [Denver Post article](https://extras.denverpost.com/news/shot0521d.htm) by Michael Booth describes the Clintons with coffee in hand during these emotional times. > The president came to the table with nothing more than a cup of coffee and his famous capacity for sympathy, but for the families of Columbine shooting victims, Bill Clinton’s patented bear hug and reflective gaze were welcome consolation. > President Clinton and first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton spent a few minutes Thursday with each of 12 families of slain Columbine victims, walking from table to table for sit-down chats during a private audience at Light of the World Catholic Church… > Setting down cups of coffee when arriving at each table, the Clintons signed Columbine memorial books created by a secretary at Bear Creek Elementary School.![President Clinton enjoying a cup of coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/bill_coffee.CEqGgPT5_Z1G54WT.webp)_President Clinton enjoying a cup of coffee._### Grande Jury Testimony Even the consummate insiders of the Clinton White House seemed frustrated by their inability to completely understand Clinton. Says Woodward: > Stephanopoulos couldn’t pretend to discern the real Clinton. Clinton was uncomfortable with unanimity of opinion from his advisers, and he often liked contradictory things. There is one person, however, who could very credibly claim to know Clinton intimately: former White House intern Monica Lewinsky. While lower on the totem pole than most salaried White House employees, Lewinsky seemed well attuned to Clinton’s tastes and cravings. While Lewinsky’s book, Monica’s Story, was not consulted for this article, the report compiled by Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr is a telling and thoroughly researched work that offers further insight on the subject. The following excerpt from the _Starr Report_ describes some of Lewinsky’s gifts to her coffee-loving boss. > When he testified to the grand jury, President Clinton acknowledged giving Monica Lewinsky several gifts, stating that ‘it was a right thing to do to give her gifts back.’(190) He acknowledged giving her gifts on December 28, 1997,(191) just three weeks before the civil deposition. During the criminal investigation, the President has produced seven gifts that Ms. Lewinsky gave him. He testified to the grand jury that Ms. Lewinsky had given him ‘a tie, a coffee cup, a number of other things I had.’(192) In addition, the President acknowledged that ‘there were some things that had been in my possession that I no longer had, I believe.’(193) ### An Ongoing Salute to the Outgoing Chief Through his presidency and throughout his life, Bill Clinton embodied many of the traits we might associate with a coffee drinker. He has always been a restless, driven, Type-A personality. Astute observers and insiders have given us plenty of evidence of Clinton’s coffee-drinking tendencies and his drive to stay wired, whether on the campaign trail or discussing policy strategy with advisers in a White House room. He will be succeeded by a man who, by all appearances, is far less the busybody type than Bubba Clinton. The White House, to be certain, will continue to be populated by many java-guzzling subordinates. Still, we at INeedCoffee predict that the aroma of freshly brewed coffee is much less likely to waft through the Oval Office in the upcoming four years. No longer obligated to salute William Jefferson Clinton as the Commander-In-Chief of the U.S. Armed Forces, INeedCoffee instead salutes him for his many lasting credentials as a Coffee Achiever.![President Clinton - Coffee Achiever](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/byebill.BB71WOGV_MhEuY.webp)_President Clinton – Coffee Achiever_ Published on January 20, 2001--- #### Alex Scofield Alex Scofield is a freelance writer who lives in Cape Cod, Mass.

# How to Brew Vietnamese Iced Coffee [Brewing Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/brewing-coffee/)---by [Michael Allen Smith](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/michael-allen-smith/)![How to Brew Vietnamese Iced Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/brew-vietnamese-coffee/how-to-brew-vietnamese-coffee.jpg) Vietnamese-style iced coffee (_ca phe sua da_ or _cà phê sữa đá_) is super easy to make. All you need is a stainless steel filter, which costs around $7 USD online. If you live in a city with a Vietnamese grocery store, you will likely find them even cheaper. Vietnamese coffee can be served hot, but we will brew an iced coffee that is both strong and sweet for this tutorial. Although it is traditional to use dark-roasted coffee for this drink, I discovered it is perfectly fine to use a medium roast. However, light-roasted coffees should be avoided, as they tend to be overpowered by the sweetness of the condensed milk. ### What You’ll Need - Vietnamese Coffee Filter - Ground coffee - Sweetened Condensed Milk - Spoon - Glass or mug - Ice - (optional) fish sauce and a toothpick![Vietnamese Coffee Brewer set](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/viet-brewing-setup.yXxdKS_0_ZitQRY.webp)_Vietnamese Coffee Filter Set_### #1 Add Condensed Milk to Glass You don’t need much, as condensed milk is very sweet. Start with just enough to cover the bottom, maybe 1/3 of an inch (~1 cm). You can always add more condensed milk later. Don’t add the ice yet. That is the last step.![condensed milk and Vietnamese coffee brewer](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/cond-milk-glass-brewer.81aubPtq_Z1W2cne.webp) ### #2 Remove the Top Screen of the Filter The coffee will go underneath the top screen, so remove it before adding coffee. ### #3 Add Ground Coffee to Filter Add one rounded tablespoon of ground coffee. There are various opinions on the best grind level. Everything from French press coarse to espresso fine. How tight the filter is screwed on will also play a role. A medium grind is a good place to start.![Add Ground Coffee to Vietnamese brewer](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/add-coffee.mqT19WCd_1RRXTq.webp) Some variations of this recipe use chicory. This is optional. You could use a coffee such as Cafe du Monde, which has chicory in it, or you could add it yourself. If you mix in chicory yourself, you don’t need more than 1/2 a teaspoon. ### #4 Cover with Top Filter Screw the top filter until it is snug. You may need to go a little tighter if you decide to use a coarse grind. More on that below.![Remove Top Filter Lid of Vietnamese Coffee brewer](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/brewr-with-lid.O3Q6JEHX_2jbfHW.webp) ### #5 Set Brewer Over Glass with Stand The advantage of brewing in a glass instead of a mug is you can watch the brewing take place.![Setup Vietnamese coffee brewer on glass](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/before-water-pour.Bq7v-zp7_Z1T0Hxr.webp) ### #6 Add Hot Water Fill the Vietnamese Coffee Filter with hot water. I usually boil the water and then let it cool for about 30 seconds before pouring it. The water should take between 4 and 5 minutes to pass through the filter. You can tighten the top filter or use a less coarse grind if it goes too fast. If it goes too slow, either the grind is too fine or the filter is screwed in too tight. There is also a lid you can place on top of the filter. I don’t use it. I prefer to monitor the progress of the brew so I know if I need to adjust the grind or the tightness of the top filter.![fill Vietnamese coffee filter with hot water](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/brew-add-water.DlaTfB9a_Z1R1kix.webp) ### #7 Wait for Brew to Complete This is the easiest part. Just wait for the water to pass through the filter. For the first few brews, use a timer. The coffee will drip through the filter. Aim for between 4 and 5 minutes. See the advice in Step #6 if you are outside that range. Notice how the coffee layers on top of the condensed milk.![Finished Vietnamese Coffee Brewing](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/brew-finishing.BVa8QNDW_Z12jwe8.webp) ### #8 Mix the Coffee and Condensed Milk Stir the condensed milk into the brewed coffee. Some recipes call for adding additional sugar. I found the drink sweet enough, but let your palate be your judge.![Mix Coffee with Condensed milk for Vietnamese iced coffee ](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/mix-coffee.CtJCBxEa_Z2muyqU.webp) ### #9 (optional) Add Fish Sauce Some places in Vietnam will soak the end of a toothpick with fish sauce and stir it into the coffee. I believe the reason for doing this is that a small amount of salt or salty flavor has been known to cut the bitterness. Darker roasted coffee, especially French Roast, tends to be more bitter. So by adding just a tiny amount of fish sauce, which happens to be salty, the heavily roasted coffee can taste smoother. If your coffee is not a dark roast, I would skip this step. ### #10 Serve With Ice Mix the ice into the drink and enjoy!![Iced Vietnamese Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/iced-vietnamese-coffee.CNE9mgSk_kGNl.webp) ### Resources [Vietnamese Iced Coffee Brewing Tutorial by Inanimate Objects](https://ineedcoffee.com/vietnamese-iced-coffee-brewing-tutorial-by-inanimate-objects/) – Comic version of this tutorial.

# Blood Pressure and Coffee [Coffee and Health](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/coffee-health/)---by [Chris Arnold](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/chris-arnold/)![Blood Pressure and Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/blood-pressure-and-coffee/coffee-blood-pressure1.jpg) There have been some irresponsible articles written over the years, that assure the reader that drinking coffee will not raise your blood pressure. And if you are interested in lowering blood pressure, you may be one of many that should consider the effects of coffee on blood pressure. This article will try to be as informative and balanced as possible, though some aspects of this issue are in fact uncertain. None of the information contained in this article should be taken as medical advice. As always, you should consult your doctor regarding any changes you are contemplating in your diet or behavior before delving into an attempt to reduce blood pressure. ### Caffeine and High Blood Pressure We all know coffee contains caffeine. But what is the relationship between caffeine and blood pressure? We have all heard that caffeine is a stimulant, but what does that really mean? What does a stimulant do in the body at a real-world level? Well, it can cause jitters, nervousness, and yes, high blood pressure – _for some_. But there are so many scenarios and variables to consider. For instance, are you a long-term coffee drinker or an occasional? Are you male or female? Do you have a family history of high blood pressure? Do you already have signs of high blood pressure? Most studies show the amount of caffeine in two American cups of coffee (about 8 ounces each) _can_ raise your systolic blood pressure from 3 to 14 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure from 4 to 13 mm Hg, at least in the short term. One study does show much lower numbers, but an increase is associated nonetheless.![blood pressure](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/coffee-blood-pressure1.D2mdjbr9_Z1Mu4qk.webp)_[Photo](http://www.flickr.com/photos/topgold/1396378277/in/photostream/) by Bernand Goldbach_### Studies in Coffee and Caffeine One 12-year study of 155,000 women showed some very interesting results. While drinking caffeinated cola was associated with an increase in blood pressure, drinking coffee did not produce the same results. The study went on to suggest that those women who drank caffeinated coffee actually may have had a _reduced_ risk of high blood pressure. We do know that, in general, those who don’t normally consume caffeine usually have a sharp temporary rise in blood pressure shortly after consuming caffeine. How this happens could be from one or more causes. One common view is that caffeine narrows the blood vessels by blocking the hormone that normally keeps them open – adenosine. Caffeine can also stimulate cortisol and adrenaline to be released, which can cause a direct increase in blood pressure. However, some recent research would suggest that long-term, regular coffee drinkers actually develop a tolerance to caffeine, and their blood pressure is not increased substantially over the long term, though this seems to be a minority view. ### Caffeine Intake Some doctors recommend against caffeine just before physical activity, which already raises your blood pressure naturally. Some doctors also suggest limiting caffeine intake to about 150-200 milligrams per day. See this chart for some coffee drinks (and other caffeinated beverages) and their corresponding caffeine content: 8 oz. of Drip Coffee 110-180 mg 8 oz. of Brewed Coffee 75-140 mg 2 oz. of Espresso 100 mg 8 oz. of Iced Tea 50 mg 8 oz. of Brewed Tea 40-60 mg 8 oz. of Green Tea 15 mg 8 oz. of Hot Cocoa 15 mg 8 oz. of Red Bull 80 mg 12 oz. of Jolt Cola 70 mg 12 oz. of Pepsi Cola 40 mg 12 oz. of Coca Cola Classic 35 mg ### Not Just Blood Pressure According to a 1999 Duke University Medical Center study of 72 regular coffee drinkers, those who drink four to five cups of coffee throughout the morning, not only have elevated blood pressure but also higher levels of two stress hormones – adrenaline and noradrenaline – lasting all day and into the evening. The body thinks that it is under stress the entire time. Both adrenaline and noradrenaline are useful for making decisions in times of stress but can be harmful to the heart if elevated over a long period of time. It can also weaken the immune system, and damage blood vessels. ### Conclusion The evidence is mounting that caffeine and coffee do increase blood pressure. It seems what is up for debate is how much. If you want to lower blood pressure, reducing or eliminating coffee and caffeine can be a step that you and your doctor can discuss. If you have a caffeine addiction, also consult your doctor, as the cold turkey approach may not be good for all. ### Resources [Does Coffee Raise Blood Pressure?](https://ineedcoffee.com/does-coffee-raise-blood-pressure/) – Another view on the relationship between coffee and blood pressure.

# Bonavita Coffee Maker versus the Technivorm Moccamaster [Brewing Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/brewing-coffee/)---by [Chris Arnold](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/chris-arnold/)![Bonavita Coffee Maker versus the Technivorm Moccamaster](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/bonavita-coffee-maker-versus-technivorm-moccamaster/DSC00484.jpg) For a long time, the Technivorm Coffee Maker reigned pretty much king for the coffee geek who wanted a semi-automatic drip brewer. It brewed at the right temp for the right amount of time, had even saturation of the grounds, a thermal carafe, and was built like a tank. It was made in the Netherlands, and it was expensive. Like almost $300 USD expensive. I owned a Technivorm Moccamaster Thermal for a few years and ended up getting rid of it in favor of something that was plumbed in, the Newco OCS-8, which I still have to this day. The Newco was one of the only other SCAA-approved brewers at the time. In any case, I no longer have the Technivorm to compare to the Bonavita side by side, but I have many years of fond memories and delicious cups of coffee. Not too long ago, Bonavita came out with a very similar brewer, at roughly half the price. Many called it the “Technivorm Killer”. So at approximately $150, can the Bonavita Coffee Maker stand up to the $300 Technivorm?_**NOTE:** Both Bonavita and Technivorm make hot plate models with glass carafes, but we aren’t going to cover those. After all, cooking your coffee is almost a white-collar crime, not to mention a huge electricity draw._### Build Quality The Bonavita build quality is definitely not as good as the Technivorm. The Bonavita feels a little cheap and plasticky in places, whereas the Technivorm is very solid with an all-aluminum body. Most differences are cosmetic, but the one internal difference is the copper heating element of the Technivorm, which presumably heats the water more efficiently and may last longer. As you will see below, it doesn’t seem to affect the temperature, so take it with a grain of salt. The Technivorm is produced in the Netherlands and designed by a Dutch company. The Bonavita is produced in China and designed by a German company. ### Thermal Carafe The Bonavita 1.25 liter stainless carafe is glass-lined, holds temps really well, and the pour spout doesn’t drip much at all. The carafe has a lid that seals pretty well. However, you need to remove the lid to place the cone filter basket for brewing, and then remove the filter basket and put the lid back on. Kind of a pain. To pour, you must press a nicely placed lever._**NOTE:** Bonavita does sell a model that is not glass-lined but looks almost identical. Make sure you get model BV1800TH, which has a glass-lined carafe._ The Technivorm 1.25 liter stainless carafe does not require levers or unscrewing to pour. You just pour. However, it was not the best. I ditched it for 2 reasons: It gave off a distinct metal taste, and the pour spout dripped like crazy. I understand some of the included carafes are better now. I replaced the stock carafe with a Zojirushi Thermal Carafe and fashioned a little platform to raise the entire brewer up enough for the Zoj to fit under and activate the safety switch. Unfortunately, you cannot do this with the Bonavita, but I don’t think you will want to; it’s plenty good. If you are using the 1 liter Zojirushi, make sure you reduce the amount of water in the tank. Otherwise, it will overfill!![Bonavita Carafe Lid](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/R0011470.fKi6uNC6_Z1kTmnB.webp)![Bonavita Carafe Closed](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/R0011472.BzDd-lBu_Z2t1JAT.webp) ### Showerhead The Bonavita showerhead has an interesting array of spray holes, and the saturation is good and even. But cleaning it can be a bit of a pain, as grounds eventually get embedded in all of the little crevices. It’s not bad, but it can take a little extra scrubbing and rinsing. The Technivorm comes with a “bar” style shower head that saturates well, though not as good as the Bonavita. But because of the open design, you can stir all you want during brewing. When I got mine, it came with a showerhead that had just one hole, but they offered an upgraded showerhead with multiple holes, which I immediately purchased and used for the life of the machine. The multi-hole showerhead made the need to stir the grounds much less critical, but sometimes you do need to get in there and stir. Cleaning is really easy, as the small metal bar just lifts off, and there are no crevices to worry about. I understand now that the multi-hole showerhead is standard. I was able to find both Technivorm showerheads in a box somewhere, as shown in the photo below. I can only guess I bought spares.![Technivorm Showerheads](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/DSC01093.wEO0jtPF_17PrxG.webp)![Bonavita Showerhead](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/DSC_6476.Ce4zgND5_2027AW.webp)![Bonavita Wet Grounds](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/R0011469.DBr4I4xI_ZCk81r.webp) ### Brew Basket The Bonavita brew basket is actually Melitta branded and accepts #4 cone filters. On the Bonavita closed design, if you want to get in there to stir the grounds during brewing, you can’t, as the design just doesn’t allow for it. Because of the more closed design, it also has vent holes to allow steam to escape, rather than collecting and going right back into the grounds. I’m not sure how much this matters in the final result, but it is nice to know they thought of that. The Technivorm brew basket accepts #4 cone filters. The Technivorm is an open design with no top and has a cool little mechanical slider that can restrict the flow out of the bottom of the filter basket to be completely closed, half-open, or full. If you want, you can keep it closed at the start of the brew for 30-60 seconds, then move it to halfway for another 30-60 seconds, and then fully open for the remainder of the cycle. This really caters to the person who wants to stand there and tinker. I always left it full open and never used that feature, but it is worth noting for the nerds out there.![Bonavita Filter Basket](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/R0011467.DOVQIERJ_ZICho7.webp)![DSC00478](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/DSC00478.s5pXlX69_1qiakM.webp)![Bonavita Top](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/DSC00486.2GngJkTi_ZDMBXS.webp) ### Water Tank Not much to say here. They both have see-thru water tanks with markings and simple lids. Just fill them with water and go.![Bonavita Water Tank](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/R0011465.BP78lVen_1mUDxR.webp) ### Power Switch & Brew Cycle They both have power buttons and when pressed, they both begin brewing within about 30-60 seconds. The Bonavita soft switch will shut off the machine automatically after 15 minutes, and although the Technivorm will stop the heating elements from consuming power after the cycle is complete, you need to shut off the hard switch manually for it to be truly off. The Technivorm has a clever little electro-mechanical safety switch that will stop brewing if the carafe is not in the right place, located down near the base. If using a 3rd party carafe, you may need to fashion a little something (like a little piece of foam, etc.) around the base of the carafe, so that it properly engages the switch.![Bonavita Switch](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/R0011464.S5LZC2tx_Z1xhY92.webp) ### Brew Temperature Neither of these units has a way to control the temperature. I have some old data from the Technivorm, and the water temps measured directly in the basket were right around 200F-202F (93C-94C). The Bonavita measures right around 201F-202F (94C). These are in line with SCAA standards, result in a great cup, and are one less thing for you to worry about. ### Brew Time The brew time of both the Bonavita and Technivorm is right around 6 minutes for a full cycle, which is in line with SCAA standards. Again, one less thing to futz with. ### Taste Because I no longer own the Technivorm, I could not do a side-by-side taste test, but you don’t forget years of drinking coffee from a single machine too easily. Both produced excellently and dare I say, comparable cups. The only thing you need to do is [dial in the grind](https://ineedcoffee.com/coffee-grind-chart/ "Coffee Grind Chart"); everything else is common sense: good water, freshly roasted beans, and a pre-heated carafe. ### Misc Both of these brewers are SCAA-approved. Both of these machines are kept simple and are not uber-geeky models like the Brazen Brewer by Behmor, where you can adjust and even calibrate temps for elevation. There is something refreshing about simplicity done right. ### Some Differences to Consider - The Bonavita is half the cost of the Technivorm ($150 vs $300). - The Bonavita has a semi-closed brewing system, which means more work in day-to-day usage, longer cleaning, and an inability to see or stir the grounds during brewing. - The Technivorm’s open design allows seeing and stirring the grounds, as well as flow control. Geeks rejoice! - The Technivorm’s showerhead is easier to clean than the Bonavita. - The Bonavita has a far better carafe right out of the box. You may want a 3rd party carafe for the Technivorm to get similar performance. - The Technivorm is made in the Netherlands (Holland), and the Bonavita in China; if that kind of thing matters to you. - The Technivorm offers a 5-year warranty, while the Bonavita has a 2-year warranty. If I was just dipping my toe into the world of better coffee, I would recommend that someone start with the Bonavita. I think it accomplishes nearly the same result as the Technivorm at half the price. However, I would suggest that for those who appreciate great build quality, a long warranty, or the ability to tinker, the Technivorm is a better choice, assuming the budget allows for it (and the 3rd party carafe you will probably want to buy).

# Are Breast Milk Lattes Just A Novelty? [Coffee History](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/coffee-history/)---by [Rachel Elliot](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/rachel-elliot/)![Are Breast Milk Lattes Just A Novelty?](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/breast-milk-lattes-are-just-a-novelty/stewie-latte-art.jpg) There is no doubt that countless new fathers have tasted at least a few drops of their wives’ breast milk at some point after childbirth. But how far will they go beyond that first innocent taste? Will they take in an entire cup? Will they fight their children for it? Will they add it to coffee? Or will they go beyond a coffee additive to the realm of the breast milk latte? Is the breast milk latte just another urban legend? ### The Taste According to a post on a discussion board on the non-defunct _Answerbag_ site: > _breast milk will almost always taste like food that the mother eats, kind of watered down and, well, milky. I was expressing in the shower one day and accidently got myself in the face, after I got over the shock, I was amazed at how much it tasted like the chicken dinner I had the night before._ Mr. Nice Guy gives a more [detailed description](https://bonnehomme.blogspot.com/2005/06/things-i-do-while-wife-and-kid-are.html): > _sweet. light body … obviously some residual sugar. a mild complexity. a little buttery, just barely effervescent. the finish is a little tannic, actually._ Alex James, the bass player for the English alternative rock band Blur, referred to breast milk as sweet. In his recipe challenge video, he prepares and offers Gordon Ramsay a taste of a breast milk cappuccino. (September 2018: The video _has been removed from YouTube.)_ Alex’s story in the video is that his wife had recently given birth to twins. Three months after delivery, she took the opportunity to drink a few beers at a Foo Fighters concert, and the alcohol temporarily condemned her breast milk. Rather than waste it, Alex saved it to share with friends like Gordon. In the video, Gordon sips it but immediately spits it out. Breast milk tastes better to the fathers than to their friends. What type of fad was Alex James trying to start by releasing such a video? Is he planning a new breast milk production facility to promote his taste fetish? Doesn’t he realize that breast milk is just too difficult to obtain outside of a committed relationship? Breast milk lattes are just not feasible for the population at large. While breast milk bank facilities do exist, they serve legitimate medical needs. Competing for that limited supply would be highly unethical just to satisfy the cravings of those seeking such a unique taste. ### The Economics The Human Milk Banking Association of North America is set up to promote donor milk banking. In 2005, they dispensed 745,329 ounces of donor breast milk to hospitals in over 80 cities across North America. All of that milk was used for legitimate medical purposes only and is not available to latte-seeking espresso snobs. Outside of the medical use restrictions, the donated milk is very expensive, selling for $3.50 an ounce, according to the article _Mama’s Milk For Sale_ on _MedIndia_. Even if you could purchase it directly, it would put the price of a 12-ounce breast milk latte at **over $42 per cup!**![stewie-latte-art](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/stewie-latte-art.D7RytHfS_Z1OsxhJ.webp)_Stewie Latte Art_ Breast milk may also be available directly from recent mothers. USA Today reported in November 2007 that an Iowa woman was offering 100 ounces of breast milk for $200. At $2 per ounce, that would bring the price of a 12-ounce Latte to $24, but still prohibitively more expensive than the $3 cow milk latte from Starbucks. Buying from unregulated individual donors could be risky. The easiest, cheapest, and safest way to obtain the famous breast milk latte is to wait until your children have been weaned off it and then beg your wife for one more bottle for your own breast milk latte adventure. ### Conclusion Although there is occasional hype and even documented video reports of breast milk lattes and cappuccinos, it is safe to say that it is just a novelty, and mostly attempted by recent fathers. You can have your whole milk, your two percent, your nonfat, or even soy milk, but any requests for a breast milk latte at your local Starbucks will likely result in just a horrified look from your barista. ### Resources [Answerbag](http://web.archive.org/web/20130902081033/http://www.answerbag.com/q_view/73253) – Archived page of a 2006 discussion thread on the taste of breast milk.

# Bialetti Diva I Caffe d’Italia Review [Espresso](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/espresso/)---by [Chris Arnold](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/chris-arnold/)![Bialetti Diva I Caffe d’Italia Review](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/bialetti-diva/DSC00952.jpg)_**UPDATE September 2020:** The Bialetti Diva I Caffe d’Italia is no longer available for purchase._ There are several single-serve pod-style coffeemakers on the market: the ubiquitous Keurig that takes K-Cups, the Tassimo, and the Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf (CBTL) Kaldi, just to name a few.  The most common use for these is for brewed-style coffee, typically at 6-8 ounces of coffee per serving. But when it comes to the espresso pod machine market, there really has only been one name: Nespresso. Until now. Bialetti, known the world over for its iconic [Stovetop Moka Pot](https://ineedcoffee.com/stovetop-espresso-brewing-tutorial/), is looking to compete in the single-serve espresso machine market.  The Bialetti I Caffe d’Italia Diva is a diminutive device that promises authentic tasting espresso, in a small attractive package that is also easy to use. So what makes the Bialetti special?  How does it compare to the Nespresso and other espresso machines?  How does the espresso taste?  Read on to find out.![bialetti diva](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/DSC00943.C07JCwGx_Z213PpO.webp) ### Bialetti’s Unique System Bialetti has a few claims as to what makes their I Caffe d’Italia system special: - A 20-bar pump (290 psi), ensuring adequate pressure to produce proper flavor and crema - 5 different espresso blends, each made in Italy, each representing the different regions of Italy - Each espresso pod comes in a sealed aluminum container, promising 2 years of shelf life ### What’s in the Box![bialetti diva box](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/DSC00923.DkHovAGL_1pkkL4.webp) The Bialetti Diva comes with an instruction manual, the main brewer unit, and a sampler pack of espresso pods (2 each of 5 different selections): 1. Milano – 100% Arabica: Light Roast with Flower and Fresh Fruit Aroma 2. Venezia – 80% Arabica / 20% Robusta: Light Roast with Spices and Vanilla Aroma 3. Roma – 50% Arabica / 50% Robusta: Medium Roast with Dried Fruit Aroma 4. Napoli – 30% Arabica / 70% Robusta: Bold Roast with Bitter Cocoa Aroma 5. Italia Deca – 60% Arabica / 40% Robusta: Medium Roast with Cereal and Bread Aroma, Decaf![bialetti diva espresso pods](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/DSC00927.C-2YCEea_1sXTAR.webp)![bialetti diva box contents](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/DSC00926.CSDm7jQE_WWp0t.webp) ### Usage We won’t cover a detailed how-to, as the Bialetti website or manual covers that quite nicely. The basic operation is pretty simple: 1. Plug the unit in 2. Fill the tank with water 3. Wait for both lights to turn green (about 60 seconds) 4. Insert a pod 5. Place your cup on the tray 6. Press a single or double-shot button 7. Enjoy your espresso!![bialetti diva](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/DSC00985.DZz5rTsh_Z24VpzM.webp) ### Machine Features - Touch Sensitive Buttons - Adjustable cup holder and drip tray - Removable water tank (holds approximately 20 ounces) - Bin for used pods (holds 10 pods) - Custom Programmable shot time (up to 55 seconds) - A “Service” light that illuminates the area around your cup - Standby mode after 15 minutes of inactivity![bialetti diva](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/DSC009691.BqnGokR-_1Veldz.webp)![bialetti diva](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/DSC00932.Bqmo1K8t_1LJOqj.webp)![bialetti diva](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/DSC00931.CAqfEfNV_bKRb1.webp) ### How Does it Compare? How Does it Taste? I am comparing the taste of the Bialetti Diva espresso to the following: - My current espresso machine, an Izzo Alex Duetto III - Super-Autos, like the [Philips Saeco Syntia](https://ineedcoffee.com/can-the-philips-saeco-syntia-deliver-espresso-perfection/) - ESE Pods (Easy Serving Espresso), in a Pasquini Livia 90 - Nespresso Espresso machines, both a little guy and the big boy industrial size - My trip to Italy (Rome, Florence, Orvieto, Volterra) I have also made a few tasting notes below for the various Bialetti espresso pod blends included. #### Alex Duetto III The quick answer is that the Bialetti Diva will not give you the quality of using freshly roasted beans in something like the Alex Duetto 3, but that is a $2500 machine with a $500 grinder to match. #### Super Autos The quality of the espresso from the Bialetti Diva is definitely better than some Super-Autos I have reviewed, costing upwards of $1000, and requiring fresh coffee beans, making quite a bit of noise, fiddly adjustments, not to mention regular maintenance and cleaning. The Bialetti Diva is far better at 1/10th the cost. #### E.S.E. Pods An E.S.E. (Easy Serving Espresso) pod is a small coffee pod with a paper filter in a disc shape, that is compatible with some traditional espresso machines using a special adapter, or with pod brewers made specifically to use an E.S.E pod. All of the Illy E.S.E espresso pods I tried with my Pasquini Liva 90 and a Francis! Francis! were horrific. Thin, watery, and minimal crema. I tried some other brands that appeared fresh, and they were also underwhelming. The Bialetti Diva is much better. #### Nespresso The Bialetti Diva machine is the closest to something like the Nespresso Pixie, but there are a couple of differences. A cup of Nespresso _looks_ better; more crema, darker color. Although the Nespresso makes a tasty espresso, it has a certain flavor of its own that I have never actually tasted anywhere else, regardless of which of the many blends you choose.  We have a gigantic one at my work, and the hardware that actually makes the espresso seems to produce the same result as the small machine my friend has at his house. The Nespresso produces almost a synthetic taste if there is such a thing. But it is still very decent considering the convenience. #### My trip to Italy (Rome, Florence, Orvieto, Volterra) I can’t really say if the espresso styles are different between the south, central, and north parts of Italy as Bialetti claims, but I can tell you one major difference in Italian espressos: they almost all use robusta at some percentage (except it seems, the vendors that use Illy coffee). Whereas in the US (at least the boutique coffee shops of California), it is invariably 100% Arabica.  So I had to reach back to the memories of my trip and try to remember how it tasted. The Diva espresso has less crema and a lighter, thinner _look_ to it than the Nespresso. But it _tastes_ more like I remember in Italy.  So yeah, good memories were brought back alive. #### Tasting Notes 1. Milano – Average Crema, Malty Flavor, Medium Body 2. Venezia – Average Crema, Mild Spice Flavor, Medium Body 3. Roma – Good Crema, Fruit Flavor, Thin Body, Bright 4. Napoli – Good Crema, Rubber Flavor, Medium Body 5. Decaf – Good Crema, Blueberry Muffin Flavor, Medium Body The most surprising to me was the Decaf since Decaf can be a little underwhelming, even when roasting your own. It was the best of the 5. The Roma was a close second, much closer to the espresso I drink at home.  The rest were OK, but if I had to purchase pods, I would stock the Roma and the Decaf.![bialetti diva](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/DSC00987.DZ6P0k13_Z26XRJj.webp) ### Pros - Straightforward, simple operation - Narrow and short space-saving design to fit under counters - Roomy bin for 10 used espresso pods - Fast 60-second warm uptime - Standby Power Saving Mode after 15 minutes of inactivity - Easy cleanup and minimal maintenance - Fresh, tasty espresso - The entry price of approximately $175, on par with Nespresso - 2-Year Warranty for the USA ### Cons - Pods are proprietary, and availability is limited - $1 per pod cost, on par with Nespresso - Only four regular blends and one decaf blend to choose from - The water tank is small at just 20 ounces, requiring refilling often - The drip tray is small, requiring more frequent emptying - Noisy Vibe Pump - Thinner, lighter crema - Not practical to use as a hot water dispenser (too slow, small tank, not enough volume) - The machine is almost entirely plastic and has that plastic feel - Touch-sensitive buttons can accidentally activate the brew cycle quite easily, like when lifting the lever![bialetti diva](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/DSC00998.CHKEA0cA_Z2aWmni.webp) The Bialetti Diva is a solid single-serve espresso machine, and competes nicely with the Nespresso, with a slight edge on flavor. This is a great way to stick your toe into the pool of espresso, without the cost or hassle of a traditional espresso machine and grinder. ### Resources_Bialetti Diva I Caffe d’Italia (no longer available)__Disclosure: INeedCoffee was sent this product at no cost, which did not affect its review._ Published on November 12, 2014--- #### Chris Arnold Chris is the creator of Two Bit History.

# Black Forest Coffee [Recipes](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/coffee-recipes/)---by [Jessica Bailey](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/jessica-bailey/)![Black Forest Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/black-forest-coffee/black-forest-coffee.jpg) Discover the delicious fusion of black forest gateau and smooth golden coffee. This wonderful recipe is ideal for the end of a meal, or as a special treat. The taste is inspired by the traditional German dessert black forest gateau, with its layers of gorgeous chocolate and maraschino cherries. The coffee, cherries, and chocolate blend perfectly to create a drink that is luxurious. Yet, this indulgent delight is not hard to make. If you follow the instructions carefully, a black forest coffee can be prepared in very little time. ### What Will I Need? Here is a list of the basic ingredients you will need to serve up to eight cups of black forest coffee:![press pot coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/press-pot-coffee1.DH-l461a_Z23oP0H.webp)_Black Forest Coffee_- 1000ml / 35fl oz coffee - 4 tablespoons chocolate syrup - 200g maraschino cherries (or 50g + 4 tablespoons maraschino cherry juice) - Whipped cream - Chocolate sprinkles Tip: Don’t be afraid of experimenting slightly. For example, adding cherry brandy will give your recipe a kick – perfect for a dinner party. ### Directions Before you begin, make sure you have enough hot coffee for you and your guests. (This recipe works best with freshly ground coffee.)**Step 1:** If using a French press (as in these illustrations), first crush 150g of maraschino cherries, removing stones as you go.![mix bowl](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/mix-bowl.DeJQuzX3_Zenh8o.webp)_Crush Cherries_**Step 2:** Brew your favourite coffee using your preferred method (we recommend a French press).**Step 3:** Mix coffee and syrup. Wait a few seconds and then, if using a French press, add the cherries. It is important to add the cherries last; this is so you don’t impair the delicate flavouring. Press the filter down now, removing the coffee grounds and cherry solids from the drink. If you’re not using a French press, simply add cherry juice.![8 cup press pot](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/8-cup-press-pot.CRfDL1aZ_ZY4dXV.webp)_La Cafetiere Optima 8-Cup Coffee Press_**Step 4:** Stir well to ensure all the flavours are blended evenly. Your drink should be smooth and rich in colour. Pour as many cups as needed.![pour coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/pour-coffee.CQFVEsWN_Z25jPN9.webp)_Pour Coffee_**Step 5:** Top with whipped cream, chocolate shavings, and remaining cherries. This is your chance to get creative. Be inspired by the traditional black forest gateau. Photographs of the elaborate decorations can be found all over the internet.**Step 6:** Sit back and enjoy with friends!![black forest coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/black-forest-coffee.BToMyiLY_Z1LJjlf.webp)_Enjoy Black Forest Coffee_ Published on March 7, 2011--- #### Jessica Bailey Jessica Bailey is a coffee lover writing on behalf of La Cafetiere, specialists in French press coffee makers and accessories for fine hot drinks.

# Black Coffee and Espresso – Not Calorie Free [Coffee and Health](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/coffee-health/)---by [Michael Allen Smith](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/michael-allen-smith/)![Black Coffee and Espresso – Not Calorie Free](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/black-coffee-and-espresso-not-calorie-free/espresso-pour-bottomless-portafilter1.jpg) In 2008, a law in Seattle forced restaurants with ten or more outlets to post the calorie, sodium, and carbohydrate count of all the food and drinks on their menu. I stopped at one of these 10+ places and saw that they listed a simple espresso as having five calories. Huh? For years, I was under the impression that coffee and its younger brother, espresso, had no calories. Well, they did until you started mucking around with them by adding sugar, dairy, and whatnot. It turns out that coffee has trace calories caused by the **natural oils** in the beans. From the article _How Many Calories in Coffee?_ by J. Foster: > The coffee bean has oils in it (which is why a barista often needs to clean their espresso machine to prevent an oily build up). Sometimes a really bad coffee can be due to the oils in it becoming rancid (this often occurs from dark roasts, which cause a subsequent release of oils – if the beans are stored for a long time the oils may go slightly rancid). This explanation implies darker roasted coffee and coffee going stale would have more calories than a fresh lighter roast. Interesting.![bottomless portafilter](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/espresso-pour-bottomless-portafilter1.Fjie5Tpl_Z22YvbA.webp)_Photo [Espresso](http://www.flickr.com/photos/33589600@N00/2381294626/) by Flickr user Dave_1979_ Just how many calories are we talking about? I searched a few sites, and the number of calories for an espresso varied between 1 and 5. A mug of brewed coffee was between 2 and 9 calories. Because I tend to put more authority behind websites with a cleaner design, I will use the numbers over on _CalorieKing_. > Espresso, unsweetened has 1 calories, 0.1g of fat and 0.0g of carbs in each shot (1 fl.oz). > Brewed, Percolated has 2 calories, 0.0g of fat and 0.0g of carbs in each serving (6 fl.oz). Did you notice something odd with those numbers? The oil-rich espresso has 0.1g of fat. Fat has nine calories per gram, which yields a calorie count of 0.9. Round that up to 1.0. That makes sense. However, _CalorieKing_ lists brewed coffee as having no fat, yet it has more calories. Digging further into the data, I noticed that brewed coffee has 0.3g of protein. Protein has four calories per gram. This would give the brewed coffee 1.2 calories. That is some conservative rounding. Espresso is listed with no protein. Lessons learned: - Espresso has trace calories from the fat of the coffee oils. - Brewed coffee has between 1 and 2 calories from trace amounts of protein. The good news for calorie counters is that picking up and drinking that beverage will burn off that calorie. So there is no need to put it into your food log. 🙂 ### Resources [In Seattle, Menu Labeling Is “In”, Trans Fat is “Out”](https://www.cspinet.org/new/200707201.html) – News release explaining the Seattle (King County) calorie labeling law.

# Brewing Coffee With the Coffee Sock [Brewing Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/brewing-coffee/)---by [Michael Allen Smith](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/michael-allen-smith/)![Brewing Coffee With the Coffee Sock](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/brewing-coffee-coffee-sock/coffee-sock.jpg) I received what has to be the most simple coffee brewing method I’ve ever seen. It is a sock attached to a wire. Not just any sock, though. The Coffee Sock is a tightly knitted sock perfect for coffee brewing. I don’t go camping, but if I did, this would be an ideal brewing method for someone wishing to keep their pack weight down. You don’t need to step outside to use the brewer. I’ve been brewing with it in my kitchen. The coffee tasted closest to the [Clever Dripper](https://ineedcoffee.com/clever-coffee-dripper-review/) or a cleaner  [French press](https://ineedcoffee.com/press-pot-tutorial/). ### #1 Place Coffee Sock into Mug This brewing method is similar to making loose-leaf tea with an in-mug filter.![Place sock into mug](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/sock-1.DOm7lo6j_1HhIea.webp)_Place the Coffee Sock into the empty mug._### #2 Add Ground Coffee I am getting good results using a [drip ground](https://ineedcoffee.com/coffee-grind-chart/). My baseline brewing ratio is 17 to 1 (17 grams of water per 1 gram of coffee). Since you will make one mug of coffee at a time, figure out how many ounces or grams your mug holds and do some basic math. I use a kitchen scale, but you could follow this basic rule. - A 12-ounce mug of coffee is 340 grams. - Divide 340 by 17, and you get 20 grams of coffee. - That little scoop that comes in a can of coffee holds 10 grams. - So, two scoops per 12-ounce mug. - If you have a 16-ounce mug, add another 1/2 a scoop. - If you have an 8-ounce mug, subtract 1/2 a scoop.![coffee scoop](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/scoop.CqYrJKEh_1iBuc6.webp)_A coffee can scoop holds about 10 grams of coffee._![add ground coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/sock-3.mWxMuGDi_lJhCQ.webp)_Add ground coffee inside the Coffee Sock._### #3 Add Hot Water Bring water to a boil and let it cool for 10-30 seconds to keep the temperature down. Fill the coffee sock slowly. After adding water, if you notice any clumps of coffee not making contact with it, use a spoon or a chopstick to break them apart. You want all the coffee grounds to make contact with it. ### #4 Wait About 3 Minutes On the official site, they use a 2-minute brew time. I got better results with a 3-minute brew time. Experiment. Use what works best for you. ### #5 Remove the Sock Filter and Serve Remove the filter, and the coffee is ready to drink.![Remove Coffee Sock](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/sock-5.C1FWXkiX_ZkDu0z.webp)_After 3 minutes, lift the Coffee Sock out of the mug._ ![coffee sock coffee is ready](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/sock-7.DXkW32MM_vaNQu.webp)_The coffee is ready!_### #6 Clean Up Let the filter cool before emptying the grounds into the trash or compost. Turn it inside out and give it a rinse. Set it aside to dry so it is ready for the next use. ### Resources Coffee Sock Company – Official site with product FAQ.

# How to Brew Espresso in a Moka Pot [Espresso](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/espresso/)---by [Kevin Kilburn](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/kevin-kilburn/)![How to Brew Espresso in a Moka Pot](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/brewing-espresso-in-a-moka/how-to-brew-espresso-in-a-moka-pot640x400.jpg) If you like coffee, then chances are that you’ll really enjoy Italian coffee (or caffè). There are many different styles, including “espresso” and cappuccino, which are both popular in the United States. All styles are based on espresso. For example, a cappuccino is an espresso with steamed milk and milk foam. Note that “espresso” is a non-Italian term used in the US. What we call espresso is simply “caffè” in Italy (note the accent on the second syllable). I’ll use the more familiar term “espresso” for this page. Just note that in Italy, the correct term is caffè. If you want to make “true” espresso, then be prepared to spend several hundred dollars on a high-quality espresso machine as you see in restaurants or cappuccino bars. These machines use high-pressure water to produce the espresso. Home machines, even the $100 models found at Walmart and other places, do not produce enough pressure to create espresso as you find in a coffee bar. A very reasonable alternative for home use is an “espresso pot”, called a Moka in Italy. The Moka is a simple device that uses steam pressure to force water through a strainer to make espresso. It won’t be exactly like the espresso you find in bars, but it can come close. The espresso pot is an inexpensive alternative to making good caffè. The method below is the Neapolitan way of making caffè. The foam usually developed from a machine is manufactured by hand in this method. One word of caution before proceeding. A 2-ounce shot of espresso has about the same amount of caffeine as an 8-ounce cup of drip coffee. Don’t get into the habit of pouring 8-ounce cups of espresso throughout the day (unless you want to be wired out all day). You’ll need the following items to make Italian espresso: good quality espresso (popular Italian brands are Illy and Kimbo), sugar, cold water, an espresso pot, a container in which to mix the espresso, and small cups (preferably ceramic espresso cups).![moka pot espresso setup](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/4DSCF1021.DBBYYV7V_1HeHul.webp)_This picture shows a disassembled espresso pot, the espresso, sugar, and a stainless steel container (far right)._ Some items on the espresso pot are replaceable. After several months of use, you may have to replace the rubber gasket (pictured on the left) or the entire strainer (right). When emptying the strainer of used coffee grounds, do not bang it. This will dent it and ruin the seal. Instead, rinse it under running water.![Moka Pot - Rubber Gasket (left) Entire Strainer (right)](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/4DSCF1018.C3BZayVD_kOXjL.webp)_Rubber Gasket (left) Entire Strainer (right)_![strainer assembly for Moka Pot Coffee Brewer](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/4DSCF1019.5SV46d9A_13CYms.webp)_This is a close-up of the strainer assembly._### #1 Fill With Cold Water Fill the espresso pot with cold water. The inside of the pot is usually marked with a line to show the fill level. If not, then fill it up to the relief valve on the side. The water should not seep through the strainer when you insert it. This will waterlog the coffee and possibly affect the flavor.![add water to moka pot espresso maker ](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/4DSCF1022.CGwXMOAp_2jkYvE.webp)_Fill water_### #2 Insert the Strainer Assembly Insert the strainer assembly into the base. (Alternately, you can fill the assembly first and then insert it. It’s a personal preference).![Insert strainer assembly to moka pot espresso maker](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/4DSCF1023.D5x1k3X-_1CuGh8.webp)_Insert strainer assembly_### #3 Add Coffee Grounds Fill the strainer with espresso. Ensure that you do not get any grounds on the outside rim of the container. There must be a perfect seal at this point or else the water will spew out once it begins to boil. Simply wipe any excess grounds off before assembling the pot. This is one reason why some people fill the strainer first then insert it.**Warning: Do not pack the espresso down!** This could possibly clog the system and generate too much pressure. Although acceptable for commercial machines, packing the espresso in this type of pot can be dangerous. If you make Stovetop Espresso on a regular basis, consider getting a [Moka Pot Coffee Dispenser](https://ineedcoffee.com/moka-pot-coffee-dispenser-review/).![Add ground espresso to moka pot espresso maker](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/4DSCF1024.BkPRMc9V_UfG7q.webp)_Add espresso to Moka._ This is what the espresso should look like after you fill the strainer. Piling the espresso in like this places it flush with the upper strainer of the pot, thus producing a stronger flavored drink. You can adjust it to your liking.![Espresso in the Moka Pot ](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/4DSCF1026.B9CkasvH_gI9JF.webp)_Espresso in the Moka._### #4 Assemble the Pot Assemble the pot. Once again, ensure that no grounds are on the outside rim. Screw the pot onto the base by holding the pot itself, not the handle. The handles can break easily (but are also replaceable).![Assemble the moka pot coffee maker](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/4DSCF1027.KfCKZTFo_Z26s9NV.webp)_Assemble the pot._### #5 Place the Coffee Pot Over Heat Place the pot over a low flame. A low flame increases the brew time, which enhances the flavor. At a later step, you’ll want a slow trickle of espresso instead of a full-force fountain. In this picture, you’ll notice a small metal piece under the pot. This piece is common for Italian stoves and is available at any hardware store. It should work with an American-style stove if the burner sides are spaced too far apart.![use a Low Flame for moka pot brewing ](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/4DSCF1028.CerqTSm9_Z1qN921.webp)_Low Flame_### #6 Get Sugar Ready While the espresso is brewing, add sugar to your mixing container. You can start with about a teaspoon per cup and then adjust it from there to suit your taste. The pot in this picture is a 10-cup pot, so I used a little more than 10 teaspoons. After some experience, you will be able to dump the right amount of sugar into the container without measuring it. Remember, making espresso is an art, not a science.![Add sugar to moka pot espresso ](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/4DSCF1030.CJRdM-kW_Z2wRqeD.webp)_Add sugar_### #7 Pour Coffee and Mix with Sugar This step is critical and may take some practice to get right. As soon as the espresso comes out, remove the pot from the heat and pour some of the liquid into the mixing container with the sugar. Adding too little is much better than adding too much, so be conservative. Once you have some espresso with the sugar, start stirring. The end result will be a slurry with the consistency of peanut butter (or a little thinner). If it is too dry, keep adding espresso a little at a time until you get the right consistency. If you run out of espresso, add it back to the flame until more comes out. You should use the first espresso out of the pot since it is the strongest. Don’t brew the entire pot then try to add it to the sugar. It won’t taste the same.![mix coffee with sugar ](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/4DSCF1032.C7Eiqm1K_Z272uEw.webp)_Pour coffee_ This is about the right consistency, maybe a little thin but it worked. If you accidentally add too much liquid, you can either add more sugar (not recommended unless you don’t mind it being super sweet) or simply add the remaining espresso at the end of the brew. It won’t have a lot of foam on top but is still drinkable.![Stir sugar with coffee ](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/4DSCF1033.CQ_lVhCS_hI6KU.webp)_Stir coffee_ The espresso comes out as mostly steam toward the end of the brew. The pot pictured here has a tube designed to minimize splatter during the brewing process. The lid on this one can remain open during brewing. Other models have two holes in the side and will spray espresso all over the kitchen if the lid is up. ### #8 Pour More When the espresso finishes brewing, pour about half of it into the mixing container.![Pour half the espresso from moka pot maker ](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/4DSCF1036.Db-uyXDO_ZCUez.webp)_Pour half the espresso_### #9 Stir, Add Remaining Espresso, and Mix Again Stir vigorously to aerate the mixture and produce a thick foam. Once thoroughly mixed, add the remaining espresso to the container and mix once again.![Stir espresso with sugar and Mix again.](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/4DSCF1037.1vTJppD8_Z1n735G.webp)_Mix again._ The end result. The amount of foam produced depends on the technique and the amount of sugar used. With just a little practice, you’ll be able to make perfect caffè every time, just like a Neapolitan.![Espresso foam from moka pot ](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/4DSCF1038.Cc-J6je6_Z1Gc525.webp)_Espresso foam_### #10 Serve The best part. Pour the espresso into small ceramic cups. You can use a spoon to get the foam into the cups if necessary. Since the cups are small, the espresso can become cold very quickly. To keep it hotter longer, place the cups in hot water just before you start brewing the espresso. When you pour the espresso into the hot cups, it will retain the heat and allow you to serve piping hot espresso to your friends.![Serve espresso from moka pot into ceramic](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/4DSCF1039.B4zsNO37_Z2h0GAz.webp)_Serve Espresso_ Two cups of perfect caffè in ten easy steps!![Finished Espresso from moka pot maker ](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/4DSCF1040.2G3IyHXm_CGTU.webp)_Finished Espresso_ Learning how to make caffè using the espresso pot is not hard.

While in Naples, Italy working for NATO, he discovered real Italian espresso and ended up buying several mokas and a La Pavoni professional lever-type espresso machine. He’s also visited Turkey, Spain, Macedonia, and Belgium and enjoyed the local coffees there. He also worked with some German soldiers and frequently enjoyed morning coffee with them. Most recently, he went to school with an Egyptian soldier who brought coffee into class. They often brewed it in a cezve (Turkish coffee pot) before class. A great way to start the morning.

# Brewing Turkish Coffee Using a Traditional Tabletop Burner [Brewing Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/brewing-coffee/)---by [Karolos Tsiligirian](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/karolos-tsiligirian/)![Brewing Turkish Coffee Using a Traditional Tabletop Burner](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/brewing-turkish-coffee-using-a-traditional-tabletop-burner/tabletop_burner_ring.jpg) Before electricity and gas, people made coffee with plain old fire! They used wood fire and big pots and ground their coffee with stones or wood. Fast-forward to the present. The tabletop burner, a small device like a lamp, was invented. This burner uses cheap (impure) blue-colored alcohol. You light it up, and it heats coffee SLOWLY so you can make Turkish coffee.![Turkish Tabletop Burner](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/tabletop_burner_11.BeMc5tgi_g2NQb.webp)_Turkish Tabletop Burner_ Once the coffee comes to a boil you just blow out the fire, and you serve in your favorite cups. The burner has a beautiful traditional design, and that’s why many people use it for decoration. Coffee enthusiasts use these traditional burners because of nostalgia for the good old days and also because they have the benefit of heating coffee SLOWLY, which is the best way.![Traditional Tabletop Burner](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/tabletop_burner_ring.C41eIkkc_ZQxiM.webp)_Traditional Tabletop Burner_### Turkish Brewing Instructions Using a Tabletop Burner 1.

# Building a Chaff Collector For Popper Roasting [Roasting Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/roasting-coffee/)---by [Catfish and Aardvark](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/catfish-and-aardvark/)![Building a Chaff Collector For Popper Roasting](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/building-a-chaff-collector-for-popper-roasting/ALL.jpg) Many of you roast with the [Westbend Poppery](https://ineedcoffee.com/roasting-coffee-in-a-popcorn-popper/), Proctor-Silex Popcorn Pumper, or some other style that may use a _soup can_ style chimney. Although these units work well, there is always the menacing problem of how to contain the chaff during the roast. This article details how to adapt the Melitta coffee roaster chaff collector to any of these style roasters.![Melitta AromaRoast](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/START1.B2adWV_d_Z2slJqJ.webp)_Melitta AromaRoast_ The parts list is short, as is the tool list and the skill level required to make the collector. However, with the popularity of home roasting on the rise, the Melitta roasters are beginning to demand an inflated price even though they are a far inferior roaster. Assuming you are able to obtain a Melitta roaster, its chaff collector is the only part you’ll need – the actual roaster can be discarded or re-sold. ### Parts List - Melitta roaster chaff collector - Piece of glass to use as a “window” - Two each pint canning jar rings - High-temperature Red “RTV” or equivalent (for sealing the glass window and jar rings) - One each soup can (that will fit the jar rings and your roaster) ### Tool List - Drill and 3/16 inch bit - Metal file - Small Philips screwdriver - Hacksaw The “stock” Melitta chaff collector is a two-piece unit: the lid and the base. Begin by disassembling the two pieces and then removing the “handle” from the top. Sit the handle and the two small screws aside so they won’t be misplaced. Before any modifications begin to the lid, it is critical that you decide what shape and size piece of glass you will be using for a window. Of course, the window is used to view the spin and progress of the roast. For our demonstration, we used a 2″ round piece obtained from an old pressure gauge. You may decide to use a piece of scrap donated or purchased from a glass shop or hardware store. The shape is really of no consequence as long as it fits well in the lid. What is important, however, is that you have the glass to use as a template for tracing the opening you are about to cut in the lid. The Melitta collector is made of thin, soft aluminum that is easy to cut and shape. As a result, it is also easily bent, so be careful.![trace ](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/TRACE.OlSglnZn_1Dv5Ds.webp) After you have traced the glass outline on the lid, retrace the image 1/4″ inside the original outline – this will be the centerline for drilling the pilot holes. Note that a center punch has been used to mark the drill points – this will prevent the bit from “wandering” should you use a hand-held drill. Also note that a wooden block has been, and should be used as a backup to help prevent distortion of the soft aluminum lid during drilling. After all the pilot holes are drilled and the opening has been cut, trimmed, and deburred, this should allow an opening of approximately 1/16″ smaller than your piece of glass. This remaining “lip” will allow a surface for final gluing (with the RED RTV) of the window to the lid. Simply apply a small bead of RED RTV around the lip and “set” the glass firmly into it. After the RTV cures/sets/dries, it can easily be trimmed with a knife edge. Reattach the handle and the lid is complete.![drill holes](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/DRILL.Bihr8rje_1mX1Pg.webp)![cut holes](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/CUT.C68tenL1_1qJfUP.webp)![remove after cut](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/CUT2.Cj3bgMbF_Z2fH3aC.webp)![glue lid](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/GLUE.18PeR-Hd_ZfjG3O.webp) The Melitta chaff collector base “donut” is complete as is. Our modification(s) are centered around the aluminum “throat” that transitions the original roaster to the chaff collector donut itself. This will require removing the throat in its entirety from the roaster base unit. After disassembling the aluminum base from the plastic roaster, the throat can easily be cut off with a hacksaw. Cut the throat off flush with the base of the collector and “dress” the sharp edges so as to remove any burrs or otherwise sharp edges. Now, you will have two distinct pieces – the base donut and the cut and dressed throat. In actuality, the throat will serve only as an adaptor to the soup can chimney. I will give you two different variations on the same theme.![saw chaff collector](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/SAW.D8aLMTJb_1Rm4TX.webp)![chaff collector lid](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/LID.BTk9B3gf_1w3MXF.webp) Option one utilizes two-pint canning jar rings. One ring will need to have its “lip” filed, sanded, or otherwise removed so that it will fit snugly inside the soup can while the other ring can remain as is with its “shoulder” intact. RTV the ring with the shoulder on one end of the throat piece that you have cut and dressed. This piece can now have a small bead of RTV applied to the outside of the ring and the whole assembly can be inserted into the bottom opening on the donut. Now you can RTV the second, shoulderless, ring onto the opposite and male end of the throat. The shoulderless ring acts as a “bushing” which allows for a snug slip fit into the female side of the soup can. Note that the shouldered ring will prevent the throat from inserting completely to the bottom of the donut. This option provides for the longest total throat and most stable connection between the chaff collector itself and the soup can.![trim lid](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/TRIM.Dydnv-A-_ZW0vYq.webp)![fit that lid](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/SAW2.CSk_k4Ax_1uWTmE.webp)![lid fit](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/LID2.B1GI7bZD_Z26AEWG.webp) Option two eliminates the shouldered ring and simply allows the original throat to insert into the donut as was originally designed on the Melitta system. The shoulderless ring is RTV’d to the opposite end of the throat as described above. This option provides for a much shorter and less stable throat. However, if you feel comfortable that your roasting skills and coordination don’t threaten the less stable setup, this may work well for you. Neither is incorrect but my recommendation would be to opt for the longer, more stable throat.![bottom of chaff collector](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/BOTTOM.A2PEjg88_8hWjT.webp)![completed chaff collector](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/ALL.BAaXYUiv_1Y2R29.webp) Once all the RTV has cured/dried/set, the unit can be assembled onto your Poppery or Pumper with the soup can chimney. One word of caution: As with any metal, **the chaff collector gets very hot during the roasting process**. Therefore, extreme caution must be exercised when touching the chaff collector. ### Resources [Roasting Coffee in a Popcorn Popper](https://ineedcoffee.com/roasting-coffee-in-a-popcorn-popper/) – Tutorial on using the Westbend Popcorn Popper to home roast coffee.

# Building Your Own Home Coffee Roaster [Roasting Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/roasting-coffee/)---by [Johnny Ma](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/johnny-ma/)![Building Your Own Home Coffee Roaster](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/building-your-own-coffee-roaster/Roaster7.jpg) In this tutorial, you will learn how to build your own stovetop coffee roaster. It will work very similar to the [Whirley-Pop popcorn poppers](https://ineedcoffee.com/stovetop-roasting-with-the-whirley-pop/), which can also be used to roast coffee. Materials needed: 1. a steel pot with an air hole on the cover 2. French press 3. coffee grinder handle and an aluminum plate.![DIY Coffee Roaster Setup](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/Roaster11.ySPy3jTi_Z1WevSi.webp)_DIY Coffee Roaster Setup_ Dismantle the handle from the boiler cover and take out the press bar and the adjusting screw parts from the French press.![Dismantle Handle](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/Roaster2.D-q9-VAs_26khYE.webp)_Dismantle Handle_ Place the adjusting screw part of the French press into the hole of the cover of the boiler and fix the position.![Fix the position](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/Roaster3.Dq9L9nbD_GUhpv.webp)_Fix the position._ Now, build your spin handlebar for the roaster. 1. The handlebar was taken from the Coffee Grinder. 2. Press bar of the French press. 3. Cement clay. Use these 3 materials to build your spin handlebar for the roaster.![Spin Handle](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/Roaster4.CVr4IK1O_Z2hJpxE.webp)_Spin Handle_ Cut the aluminum plate for the internal wiper inside the roaster. Make sure that on both sides, you have a height of 2.5-3cm so that the coffee beans can be evenly turned over while roasting. Also, drill a hole on top of the aluminum plate for you to attach it to the spin handlebar.![Aluminum Plate](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/Roaster5.DfaXwSyz_cLeEh.webp)_Aluminum Plate_ When the whole thing is done, it should look like this and test it if you can turn the spin handlebar smoothly.![Test the Handle](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/Roaster6.CAlTmzM1_Z2wuEbz.webp)_Test the Handle_ Now you are done and need to study how to control the heat and how to roast. You need a lot of experience to get used to your own homemade roaster. Even after you get your coffee roasted, you need to let it rest for around 48-72 hours before testing the taste. So a lot of time is needed. The only thing that you could test just after roasting is checking if the coffee bean is evenly roasted by taking one coffee bean and breaking it to check that the external color and internal color are the same or not.![Finished DIY Coffee Roaster](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/Roaster7.DG1s-r94_2ewOxU.webp)_Finished DIY Coffee Roaster_ Published on January 1, 2005--- #### Johnny Ma

# Buying Your First Home Coffee Roaster [Roasting Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/roasting-coffee/)---by [Michael Allen Smith](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/michael-allen-smith/)![Buying Your First Home Coffee Roaster](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/buying-your-first-home-coffee-roaster/buying-home-roaster.jpg) I started home roasting coffee in June 1998. Since then, I’ve used several different roasters and methods. I’ll be the first to confess that I haven’t kept up with all the different machines available to home coffee roasters. What I have learned are the most important factors to consider when buying your first home coffee roaster. ### #1 Indoor, Outdoor, or Somewhere In Between? The most important factor in deciding on a roaster is answering the question, “Where do you plan on roasting?” Some coffee roasters work indoors, but many or most would be better set up in a garage, a patio, or a porch. Roasting coffee produces smoke—more smoke than you get when cooking food. Coffee also releases thin paper-like chaff during the roast that can add to the cleanup. The darker you roast your coffee or the more beans you roast, the more I encourage you not to roast indoors. An exception would be kitchens with extremely good vents. Most dedicated home roasters will have some filter to catch the chaff. They also clean the smoke to differing degrees. Popcorn poppers won’t. The downside to outdoor roasting is that if you live in a cold environment, you will need to devise hacks to keep your roaster warm enough without creating a fire hazard. ### #2 Noise Coffee roasters can be somewhat quiet or extremely loud. Air roasters tend to be louder than drum roasters. Noise can be problematic for the new home roaster since you are learning to listen for the first and second crack. The quieter the roaster is, the easier it is to hear those cracks. Generally, drum roasters tend to be quieter than air roasters. They also tend to cost more, but they also last longer. ### #3 Price Home coffee roasters can be as cheap as a tray in an [oven](https://ineedcoffee.com/home-roasting-coffee-in-an-oven/) or as much as you want to spend. The [Hottop Programmable](https://ineedcoffee.com/hottop-kn-8828p-coffee-bean-roaster-first-look/) is about $1000. Roasting coffee is an intense process. Don’t expect your roaster to last as long as your coffee pot. It won’t. Almost half the roasters I’ve owned have died shortly before or after the warranty expired. If the machine you buy has a 2-year warranty, expect 2 years of life and no more. Start saving for your next machine as soon as you pull it out of the box. ### #4 Volume Different roasters have different volumes. Some coffee roasters roast too little for some households. Although something is to be said about starting small while you are learning, you also don’t want to spend a lot of money on a small-volume roaster you are certain to outgrow. ### Decision Time Once you’ve answered those four questions, you can then choose the best home coffee roaster for you. Keep in mind that most of the people I know who started roasting their own coffee will try many different roasting methods. It is too much fun not to experiment with new roasting methods.![Westbend Poppery Roaster](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/westbend-the-poppery.BuLpKUEG_1eFQEw.webp)_Westbend Poppery 1500 Watt – Best For Beginners._### The Poppery For Beginners However, if I were to recommend a single home roasting method for the beginner, it would be the Westbend Poppery 1500 Watt popcorn popper. It is not an indoor roaster, but it is super quiet and hands-on, so you can hear and see the coffee roasting. They are available on eBay for about $60. That is too expensive for a lousy popcorn popper, but a bargain for a solid coffee roaster. My Poppery roasters have outlasted every other coffee roaster I’ve ever owned. The Poppery does require access to the outdoors, as it throws chaff and produces smoke. I hope this helped. Knowing how much money you have to spend, your noise sensitivity, how much coffee your home consumes, and if you have access to a porch or patio with an electrical outlet will help guide your search for your first home coffee roaster. ### Resources [Roasting Coffee in a Popcorn Popper](https://ineedcoffee.com/roasting-coffee-in-a-popcorn-popper/) – My tutorial on roasting coffee in the Westbend Poppery [Hottop KN-8828P Coffee Bean Roaster First Look](https://ineedcoffee.com/hottop-kn-8828p-coffee-bean-roaster-first-look/) – Overview of the Hottop coffee roaster.

# Buying a French Press – Picking the Right One [Brewing Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/brewing-coffee/)---by [Michael Allen Smith](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/michael-allen-smith/)![Buying a French Press – Picking the Right One](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/buying-a-french-press-picking-the-right-one/french-press-buying-guide.jpg) Since the first version of this article was published several years ago, the landscape of French Press options has changed. Back then, most French Press options for sale in coffee shops were various sizes of the same glass or plastic press pot. Today, there are so many more options. Even though there are more options, **I believe selecting a French Press is one of the easiest coffee equipment decisions**. For this article, I divided French Press users into four groups: The Road Warrior, The Traveler, Glass Fans, and Stainless Steel Fans. For about a decade, I brewed almost exclusively with the French Press. I had two different French Press brewers at home: a larger one that I used when guests came over and a smaller one that was my day-to-day workhorse. I also kept a cheap French Press at my desk for brewing coffee at the office. Despite their differences, the coffee they brewed tasted pretty much the same. After brewing a few thousand times with various French Press brewers, I learned that **as long as the filter seal was tight, no one French Press made better coffee than the next**. Using better coffee, having a more consistent grind, or [changing your coffee to water ratio](https://ineedcoffee.com/coffee-grind-chart/) will be vastly more important. So, if you already have a working French Press and don’t like the results, head over to the Troubleshooting French Press Coffee article before pulling out your credit card to buy a new brewer. ### #1 The Road Warrior For the Road Warrior, seek out an all-in-one French Press travel mug. You brew the coffee right in the mug, which is pretty slick. A good one will fit in your car’s drink holder. I used to dislike these brewers because the seals were never that great. Some of the coffee would over-extract, and then the rebel grounds would escape up into the coffee. The next thing I know, I’m spitting out coffee grounds. Fortunately, _Bodum_ has solved the problem. They have a travel French Press that keeps the grounds down and the coffee warm. Just be sure to use the provided recipe and not overload it with too much ground coffee.![bodum french press travel](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/bodum-french-press-travel.BtBQaQF7_Z2qNboe.webp) *Bodum Insulated Stainless-Steel Travel French Press Coffee and Tea Mug * The downside to this method would be if you needed more than 15 ounces of coffee on your road trip. In that case, brew with something larger at home and seek a thermos solution. ### #2 The Traveler If you will use this French Press for traveling or camping, the most important features will be portability and durability. You don’t want to be pulling pieces of broken glass out of your luggage on your vacation. If you are traveling alone, consider the recommendation in the Road Warrior section. However, if you want to have more coffee while sitting around a campfire, you will need a higher-volume French Press. GSI Outdoors makes a 50-ounce lightweight French Press made of BPA-free plastic. I love the insulating sleeve that covers this brewer. It will help keep the coffee warmer for longer.![gsi java press blue - french press coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/gsi-Java-press-blue.DoqxcaRv_Kn5A6.webp)_GSI Outdoors Java Press Coffee Maker_### #3 Glass French Press Fans Now that we have covered the needs of The Road Warriors and The Travelers let’s step inside and pick an ideal French Press for our kitchen or office break room. At this stage, we can focus on deciding between glass or stainless steel brewers. Most people instinctively prefer the look of one over the other, but if you are undecided, ask yourself the following questions. 1. Do you like to see the coffee when you brew it? Seeing it on the counter and watching the plunger descend into the brew. If so, then go for glass. 2. Glass can and will break—I’ve had a few shatters—but there are glass options with more sturdy and protective frames. If your cat or child knocks your stainless steel brewer off the counter, it won’t shatter. 3. Do you drink your coffee slowly? If so, stainless steel models retain heat for longer. More on that in the next section. The perfect glass French Press model will have a stable base and a sturdy frame. I like the look and feel of the _Ecooe Borosilicate_. Its solid base grips the counter, which is important for those times when you accidentally grind too fine and have to push down with some force.![ecooe glass french press coffee maker](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/ecooe-french-press.CJxTDkpQ_26hsCz.webp) *Ecooe Borosilicate Glass Stainless Steel French Press Coffee Maker with 4-Filter, 600ml * The _Ecooe Borosilicate_ makes 20 ounces of coffee at a time. What if you need more volume? The _Bodum Brazil_ comes in both a 34-ounce and a 51-ounce model. I prefer the flat plastic base of the _Brazil_ to the metal-framed _Chambord_ model. Not only does the Brazil cost less, but I once had a metal leg break on a _Chambord_, rendering my brewer useless or unsafe.![bodum brazil french press coffee maker](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/bodum-brazil-51.DcPR8TDm_tcsLo.webp)_Bodum Brazil French Press_### #4 Stainless Steel French Press Fans Stainless Steel French Press brewers have two advantages over glass models: They can’t shatter and retain heat better. If you serve all your coffee as soon as it finishes brewing, heat retention will not be important. However, stainless steel is a great option if you like to stretch out your coffee experience and want your coffee to stay hot. See the chart below.![press pot insulation temperature and time graph ](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/press-pot-insulation.BMv3FCFC_1OJqAR.webp) This chart compares the heat retention of a stainless steel French Press versus a glass French Press. We used the [Tabletop model](https://ineedcoffee.com/table-top-press-pot-review/) for this test. Other stainless steel models should retain heat equally. My tip would be to rinse the brewer with hot water before brewing. There are a few stainless steel French Press options. The _Bruhen_ has a slick design and is more affordable than the [Frieling](https://ineedcoffee.com/the-frieling-french-press/). It can also brew 32 ounces of coffee and has a heat retention curve similar to the Planetary Design model in the above chart. ![bruhen french press coffee maker ](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/bruhen-french-press.DHpxXTlA_ZqXkIC.webp) *Bruhen Large Stainless Steel French Press Coffee Maker * If you want a French Press in a brighter color, look into Tabletop French Press models by Planetary Designs. They come in a variety of colors, such as black, brushed steel, candy apple red, mocha, and green tea.![Planetary Design Table Top Press Pot Coffee Maker](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/table-top-press-pot.CUuyTQYm_cGptM.webp)_French Press Tabletop Coffee and Tea Maker_### Conclusion See how easy that was? Unlike an espresso machine, which can take longer to research than a car, picking the right French press is pretty straightforward. Most are inexpensive, so even if you don’t like the one you purchase, you can always buy another one. ### Resources [French Press Tutorial](https://ineedcoffee.com/press-pot-tutorial/) – This tutorial will get you brewing once you’ve bought your French Press.

# Ellen Ulken In Louisiana the coffee is often ground with chicory. Jerry and I usually drink a dark roasted chicory brew at home, made by CDM (Cafe du Monde) or Community Coffee, long time New Orleans coffee bean roasters. However, we love a good Cappuccino (dry and low fat) from Starbucks, or from CC's, Community Coffee's own coffee shop chain. P.J.'s is another local java house franchise. Fortunately there's a coffee possibility on every corner these days. It's wonderful. I have come to writing late, as a retiree, and do mostly memoir, but have also penned a small book, meant for young adults, but suitable for all who are interested in the man, on Stephen Collins Foster, composer of "Oh! Susanna" and "Jeanie with the Light Brown Hair."

# Heidi Tadesse I am originally from Ethiopia. When I was younger my parents had a coffee tree in the back of the house. When ripe the coffee beans have a beautiful reddish color and a sweet taste. We would pick the beans and dry it in the sun (depending on the weather it could take weeks to dry). As the beans dried, the color and the size of the bean changes; they became smaller and darker. From a very young age I watched my mother preparing the coffee ceremony every day in the morning. She would invite all her neighbours and prepare little snacks. Everyone would talk about what had happened the night before and share their dreams. The ceremony lasts over two hours and can include a fortune-telling reading of the coffee grounds. The first time I roasted coffee I was 10 years. I was fascinated how the simplest thing (coffee) brought a big gathering in my mother's house every day. - [<h2>Roasting Coffee in a Frying Pan</h2>December 17, 2014](https://ineedcoffee.com/roasting-coffee-in-a-frying-pan/)

# Kevin Kilburn Kevin is in the US Army and enjoys various coffees from around the world. While in Naples, Italy working for NATO, he discovered real Italian espresso and ended up buying several mokas and a La Pavoni professional lever-type espresso machine. He's also visited Turkey, Spain, Macedonia, and Belgium and enjoyed the local coffees there. He also worked with some German soldiers and frequently enjoyed morning coffee with them. Most recently, he went to school with an Egyptian soldier who brought coffee into class. They often brewed it in a cezve (Turkish coffee pot) before class. A great way to start the morning. - [<h2>How to Brew Espresso in a Moka Pot</h2>February 11, 2018](https://ineedcoffee.com/brewing-espresso-in-a-moka/)

# Len Brault A 25-year veteran of marketing and design, he decided in 2005 that he would turn his strengths to the beverage he loved and began a pilgrimage to find the "original" coffees that he had once loved so much more than the modern-day hybrids and unidimensional Arabicas that seemed to permeate the landscape. He would find the best heirloom coffees that remained largely undiscovered and unchanged by Western influence and showcase these coffees on the Internet. The search led him to Southeast Asian coffees (primarily Vietnamese and Philippine), established a century or more ago and still being cultivated, processed and brewed locally in traditional manners from an era gone by, unknown to the industry, markets, and media in the USA and Canada. Since that time Len has evaluated thousands of coffees in a continuing search for the original, traditional, and unspoiled, and expanded to unique Latin American coffees as well. He has undertaken the task of writing about these coffees, the cultures from which they came, and the manners in which they are brewed and enjoyed. His comment? "It's a rough job, but somebody has to do it." His company, Len's Coffee, is devoted to helping indigenous producers gain access to international distribution under their own brand names so that they achieve the most "fair" of all trades, which is, eliminating commodities brokers and receiving all the fruits of their own labors. The overriding principle that guides his company is the belief that coffee, the second-highest-volume traded commodity in the world, has a tremendous and largely untapped potential to engineer social change and improve the quality of life for millions of people around the globe simply by the practice of making better choices, on the wholesale and consumer levels.

# Michael Rohde MIKE ROHDE has a passion for simple and usable design solutions. That passion, along with his lifelong habit of recording concepts and observations through sketching and doodling, inspired him to develop sketchnotes--a practical art that translates simple and complex ideas into easily recalled bits of information. Professionally, Mike focuses on user interface, user experience, visual design, and icon design for mobile and web applications at Gomoll Research + Design in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. As an author, Mike has created the popular Sketchnote Handbook and Sketchnote Workbook series of books with Peachpit Press. In his illustration practice, Mike uses his unique drawing style to amplify and clarify ideas. His work has been featured in REWORK, the best-selling book by Jason Fried and David Heinemeier Hansson; The $100 Startup, a best-selling book by Chris Guillebeau; and The Little Book of Talent by Daniel Coyle. As a sketchnoter, Mike provides live, real-time sketchnotes of events, meetings, and experiences in venues across the United States. He is the founder of The Sketchnote Army, a website dedicated to finding and showcasing sketchnotes and sketchnoters from around the world. Mike has also shared his thinking, design process, and samples of his design and illustration work at his personal website, rohdesign.com, since 2003.

# Myron Joshua Myron Joshua grew up on Chocolate Milk with the gurgling of his mother's Folgers being percolated in the background. At age 18 while living on a Kibbutz in Israel he learned to drink "cafe botz" (Cooked turkish coffee) in the communal dining hall before going to the fields at 5:30 am. From then it was 30 years of instant coffee (no sugar, no milk) until someone poured him a cup of brewed Sumatran. Now he grinds his own beans before going to work at his office in Kibbutz Kfar Etzion. - [<h2>The Story of the Bialetti Moka Express</h2>December 27, 2018](https://ineedcoffee.com/the-story-of-the-bialetti-moka-express/) - [<h2>Yellow Coat: Two Coffee Paintings Tell a Short Story</h2>April 18, 2013](https://ineedcoffee.com/yellow-coat-two-coffee-paintings-tell-a-short-story/) - [<h2>Coffee In Israel</h2>July 18, 2011](https://ineedcoffee.com/coffee-in-israel/) - [<h2>Ceramics and Coffee: The Italian Way!</h2>January 25, 2004](https://ineedcoffee.com/ceramics-and-coffee-the-italian-way/) - [<h2>Saul Bellow: Coffee Achiever</h2>May 1, 2001](https://ineedcoffee.com/saul-bellow-coffee-achiever/) - [<h2>The Zassenhaus Manual Coffee Grinder</h2>January 1, 2001](https://ineedcoffee.com/grind-your-own-coffee-beans/)

# Sam Hampton Sam Hampton caught his first fish at age five, and in that same year started drinking coffee. He has been hard at both ever since. After several careers as an Accountant, Computer Programmer, System Analyst, and Printer Shop owner, Sam Hampton dropped out to become a Trout Bum and Maintenance Man. Then He retired to dedicate the rest of his life to the things he loved, cooking, fishing, writing, fixing stuff up to run better and drinking coffee. He regrets that his long love of coffee did not include roasting coffee until recently. He is no stranger to custom roasted beans. He has often had some of the finest coffees offered. He constantly strived, regardless of where he was, to have the best coffee available under the circumstances. He just never roasted his own. Roasting his own seemed to evade him over the years, until a video by the Yankee Self-Sufficiency (Combining Snarky and Fine Coffee) encouraged him to try his hand at it. With guidance from the internet, he happened upon Sweet Maria’s and ineedcoffee.com to further his efforts. Sam Hampton has never been one to take advice at face value and he likes to add his own touch to anything he attempts. Sam Hampton now lives, tinkers and writes from San Jose, Ca.

This super-easy recipe rounds out the recipes for this summer. You can create this in just a few minutes without forsaking your tan.![coffee pudding](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/coffee_pudding.Aa4a0dpg_Z1oiHk9.webp)_Cafe Au Lait Pudding_### Ingredients: (Makes enough for 2-3 people) - 1 package of Jell-O brand vanilla instant pudding (2.5 oz.) - 1 package of Jell-O brand chocolate instant pudding (2.5 oz.) - 3 1/2 cups of milk. - 1 cup of drip coffee, chilled. (Any house blend will do, just don’t use a flavored coffee.) - Whipped cream in a can for garnish. - Three bowls, and serving dishes for the pudding. ### Directions Follow the directions on the package for preparing the vanilla pudding: add 2 cups of cold milk and pudding mix in a bowl and whisk for two minutes. In a separate bowl, prepare the chocolate pudding. The directions call for 2 cups of milk. Instead, put in 1 1/2 cups of milk and 1/2 cup of chilled coffee and pudding mix in a bowl and whisk for two minutes. Transfer about 4 tablespoons of the vanilla and 4 tablespoons of the chocolate pudding to a third bowl. Add 2 more tablespoons of coffee to this batch. Whisk this batch. It should appear a few shades lighter than the chocolate pudding’s color. Discard the remainder of the coffee (or drink it). Layer in cups or parfait glasses. Refrigerate for five minutes. Garnish with whipped cream before serving. Published on September 1, 2000--- #### Lura Lee Lura Lee enjoys coffee, but no longer pursues coffee as a hobby.

# How to Make Cafe Cubano (Cuban Coffee) [Brewing Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/brewing-coffee/)---by [Maria-Victoria Suarez](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/maria-victoria-suarez/)![How to Make Cafe Cubano (Cuban Coffee)](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/cafe-cubano-cuban-coffee/how-to-make-cuban-coffee.jpg) What tequila is to liquor, _cafe cubano_ is to the world of coffee. It is not sipped or savored… it is shot! _Cafe Cubano_ is at least double the strength of American coffee. It is a daily morning ritual for Cubans and Cuban-Americans. At any time of day or night at the countless little Cuban restaurants that dot Miami, people line up for “jolts” of _cafe cubano_ served in thimble-sized paper cups. Cuban coffee is served at the end of a meal in _tacitas_ (tiny cups) that are smaller than demitasse cups. The old-fashioned way to make _cafe cubano_ is in a pot on the stove, though the truth is that Cubans in this country often make their coffee in Italian espresso makers. The tutorial below will use a Stovetop Espresso pot. ### The Coffee You can best approximate the taste of Cuban coffee by using finely ground, almost powdered coffee. Cuban-style coffee is also widely available in both whole bean and ground espresso blends. Cubans enjoy their coffee with generous amounts of sugar. I have added sugar to this coffee recipe since that is how it generally is made, but if you wish to omit the sugar, that’s fine.![Moka Espresso Pot ](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/moka-on-table.Dfpta7mC_Z1G0czI.webp)_Stovetop Espresso_### The Process Unscrew the Italian espresso maker and remove the metal filter cup from the bottom half. Pour ice-cold water into the bottom of the espresso maker up to the bolt located on the inside.![Moka Pot open ](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/moka-pot-parts-table.BDnM2dlv_pzIFx.webp)_Disassemble Pot, Remove Filter, and Fill with Water_ Position the metal filter cup back into the bottom half and tamp very tightly with coffee grounds, leveling it off at the top. Screw the espresso maker together and place it on a hot burner (high heat). While keeping an eye on the espresso maker, take a metal cup and pour about one teaspoon for each _tacita_.![Moka Pot with Coffee Grounds](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/mok-pot-fill-coffee-grounds.BqqSSbjo_26YXBx.webp)_Portafilter Loaded_ A typical stovetop espresso maker makes four _tacitas_, but they are available in as small as two (for the lonely Cuban bachelor) and as many as eight and up (for Noche Buena – the family Christmas Eve dinner). As the first trickles of coffee percolate, pour enough to moisten the sugar in the metal cup. Vigorously mix the moistened sugar and coffee until it becomes a light paste. In the meantime, take the espresso maker off the heat once the top portion is about 3/4 of the way full. This will prevent it from burning and/or overflowing onto your stove. Once the coffee is done, pour it slowly into the metal cup while gently mixing it with the sugar paste. If done properly (and yes, it takes practice and a special touch), the sugar paste will create a “foam” once it is mixed with the rest of the coffee. Pour into _tacitas_ or demitasse cups and shoot!![Moka Brew in Action ](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/moka-brew-in-action.CHxMV9Mk_ayEmU.webp) ### Cafe con Leche (Cuban Coffee with Milk)_Cafe Cubano’s_ quieter cousin, _cafe con leche_ should be called _leche con cafe_ for it really is milk with coffee. A steaming cup of this sweet, comforting portion served with toasted bread or Cuban crackers is a typical Cuban breakfast. Heat milk in a pot. _Cafe con leche_ is usually made with whole milk, or a mixture of whole and evaporated milk, but any milk will do – dare I say, even soy. _Sorry, Abuelita (Dear Grandmother)!_ Pour the hot milk into a mug, filling it almost to the top. Throw in a _tacita_ of _Cafe Cubano_ and stir. Sit back, pop in the Buena Vista Social Club CD, and feel the warm Gulf breeze.![Moka Pot Back yard ](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/moka-back-yard.T7VNoGkR_Z1vSvHS.webp) ### Resources [Stovetop Espresso Brewing Tutorial](https://ineedcoffee.com/stovetop-espresso-brewing-tutorial/) – An updated step-by-step brewing tutorial.

My family called this recipe “cafe fourb”, which means “crazy coffee” in Italian. When I became of age, I too, picked up this habit and I still find it the most tasteful, calming, delightful cup of fresh coffee with the memory of my parents enjoying that quiet, satisfying drink. Following is the recipe: - 1 cup fresh coffee (could be decaf if preferred) - 1 shot of good bourbon - 1 teaspoon sugar![Cafe Fourb](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/fourb.BQE4JC06_ZpbyND.webp)_Coffee + Bourbon = Cafe Fourb_ When choosing a good, any level of roast will work. I’ve used 100 proof bourbons with this recipe. One good inexpensive 100-proof bourbon is Knob Creek. But remember, no more than one cup each time. Try it, my friend, guarantee you too will enjoy it. Oh, as an added attraction, I would always have a jar of the whiskey full of fat Bing cherries soaking until each cherry was equivalent to 1 shot. Gracious sake, everybody loved my crazy coffee!

# Caffeine and Skin Cancer [Coffee and Health](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/coffee-health/)---by [Tracy Butenko](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/tracy-butenko/)![Caffeine and Skin Cancer](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/caffeine-and-skin-cancer/coffee-sky1.jpg) Coffee, America’s favorite hot beverage, contains over 300 naturally occurring base chemicals that act as powerful antioxidants. The active chemicals in coffee are most beneficial when consumed within 20 minutes after brewing. After that, coffee starts to oxidize, and as we all know, it becomes a little bitter and acidic. This does not mean that you still won’t get that “java jolt” after the 20 minutes is up, but science has found that coffee can actually be good for you right after it is freshly brewed. The other good news is that studies are indicating caffeine, when applied topically to the skin, can prevent the occurrence of skin cancer caused by UV radiation. Dr. Conney, Professor of Pharmacology at the University of New Jersey, and his team conducted clinical trials using a caffeinated lotion on mice. They also used another active ingredient, EGCG (epigallocatechin gallate), a natural chemical found in green tea. These research findings reaffirm the beneficial effects of caffeine in preventing skin cancer, as shown by other scientific experiments starting the 1970’s (Scientists Zaidela and Latarjet, 1973 and 1978; Huang, et al, 1997; Lu, et al, 2002). At the time, the hypothesis presented was that caffeine was slowing down DNA repair after the damage produced by UV irradiation and, by slowing it down, was allowing the repair to be more precise, avoiding the mutations that lead to cancer. Caffeine has also been found to be an effective antioxidant, scavenging OH radicals, thus producing another mechanism for its anticancer properties.![coffee ceiling](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/coffee-sky1.BQ3mWo1h_Z2g3OXY.webp) These investigators measured how many tumors the mice developed within the clinical trials. Mice treated with caffeinated lotion developed 44% fewer non-cancerous tumors and 72% fewer cancerous tumors than those given the inactive treatment. Mice that received the EGCG-filled lotion had a reduction in their non-cancerous and cancerous tumors of 55% and 65%, respectively. In addition to these clinical surveys, coffee has been used for centuries to detoxify and destress. The Japanese soak in large vats of coffee grounds, expressly for this reason. Coffee scrubs and salts have been the rage in recent years due to their ability to exfoliate, soothe, deodorize, and heal. There are coffee aficionados who claim that rubbing coffee grounds on the scalp will cure dandruff and can actually regrow hair (although no clinical data has been reported to prove this). What we know for sure, in addition to its protective abilities, is that the natural caffeine in coffee will reduce and heal acne breakouts. With continued use, it will fade age spots and reduce wrinkles on the skin, and it can calm skin allergies. Pretty impressive findings for a little bean that grows on a tree, but nature provides us with all kinds of botanical benefits. We just need to learn how to use them wisely!

# Caffeinated Classics: Brave New World [Cafe Culture](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/cafe-culture/)---by [Alex Scofield](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/alex-scofield/)![Caffeinated Classics: Brave New World](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/caffeinated-classics-brave-new-world/brave-new-world-black-cover.jpg) Deep down inside, do each of us really yearn for some conflict, struggle, and sadness in our lives? What would be lost if we were to become permanently happy? This is what Aldous Huxley explores in _Brave New World_, the fifth-best novel of the 20th century if you’re inclined to believe the Modern Library editorial board. Can permanent happiness be achieved without coffee? It seems implausible, and Huxley apparently agrees. Aging, career quandaries, and unrequited love — unrequited anything, really, as well as any form of love — are absent in the Brave New World. But in the year 632 AF (After Ford — and yes, that’s Henry Ford), they’re still drinking coffee. Occasionally. Coffee only appears once in _Brave New World_, and even then, it’s used to wash down soma, a happy-pill drug the characters constantly take. > Landing on the roof of Henry’s forty-story apartment house in Westminster, they went straight down to the dining-hall. There, in a loud and cheerful company, they ate an excellent meal. _Soma_ was served with coffee. _— Brave New World by Aldous Huxley, Chapter 5, Part 1_![brave-new-world-book](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/brave-new-world-book1.q2fg_s24_Z1jiY6Q.webp)_Brave New World by Aldous Huxley_ I wonder if Huxley made an error in this lone mention of coffee — elsewhere in the book, characters drink “caffeine solution.” That seems more in tune with Brave New World, where every desire is instantly gratified. Fine hotels give guests what they want — caffeine solution, amongst other luxuries: > They slept that night at Santa Fe. The hotel was excellent — incomparably better, for example, than that horrible Aurora Bora Palace in which Lenina had suffered so much the previous summer. Liquid air, television, vibro-vacuum massage, radio, boiling caffeine solution, hot contraceptives, and eight different kinds of scent were laid on in every bedroom. _— Brave New World, Chapter 5, Part 3_ The book is set in London, and some traditions endure. Taking caffeine solution, perhaps with crumpets, is still a mark of polite society. Helmholtz is unfazed when he gets into, uhm, hot water with his fordship, the Resident Controller of Western Europe. > Helmholtz laughed aloud. “It’s more like a caffeine-solution party than a trial,” he said, and let himself fall into the most luxurious of pneumatic armchairs. _— Brave New World, Chapter 16, Part 1_ I’m reluctant to opine much when discussing classics. After all, they’re classics, right? I can either affirm the self-evident — the classic novel is really good — or I can be the contrarian blogger who trashes the classic novel. And who would I be kidding then?? I’ll leave it at this: I enjoyed Brave New World, especially the dark humor that grows darker and yet more humorous as the book goes on — A Clockwork Orange by Anthony Burgess similarly resonated with me. I don’t think BNW was the 5th-best 20th-century novel I’ve read, but there have been many more laughable best-of-list inclusions than this one.

# Caffeine Consumption By Coffee Fanatics [Coffee and Health](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/coffee-health/)---by [Michael Allen Smith](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/michael-allen-smith/)![Caffeine Consumption By Coffee Fanatics](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/caffeine-consumption-by-coffee-fanatics/coke-zero-thailand1.jpg) Once people learn about the INeedCoffee website, they come to the same conclusion. _You must drink a lot of coffee!_ I tried to defend myself for the longest time by explaining that I prefer quality over quantity. I don’t think I drink a lot of coffee. But what is considered _a lot of coffee_? I have an uncle who consumes more coffee in a day than I do in a week. But I also know people who could make the same comparison about me. In this article, I’ve decided to lay my cards on the table and let you decide if I consume too little or too much caffeine. To make it more interesting, I’ve invited other INeedCoffee contributors to send me a _typical day_ journal of caffeine consumption.**Michael Allen Smith, Seattle** My weapon of choice is espresso, although recently I have developed a taste for many oolong and green teas. - **5:45 AM** – Oolong Tea - **6:15 AM** – Double Espresso - **7:45 AM** – Double Espresso - **10:00 AM** – Coke Zero (1 can) - **12:15 PM** – Double Espresso - **2:45 PM** – Double Espresso (gym days only) - **5:45 PM** – Green Tea![coke zero thailand](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/coke-zero-thailand1.CUHQyQ-E_2qHvUU.webp)_Coke Zero in Thailand_**Paul Rj Muller, CaffiNation USA** Paul runs the [CaffiNation](https://www.caffination.com/) website.

# Cafes and Roasters Weather Seasonal Extremes [Coffee Business](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/coffee-business/)---by [Alex Scofield](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/alex-scofield/)![Cafes and Roasters Weather Seasonal Extremes](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/cafes-and-roasters-weather-seasonal-extremes/boardwalk1.jpg) Jonathan Kelly is only half-joking when he says he can go bowling on the main street of Wellfleet, Mass. in February. There are about 3,000 who live in Wellfleet year-round; come summer, more than 9,000 will be there. It’s a seasonal ebb and flow typical of Cape Cod, where many local business owners opt to close up shop from October through May. Kelly is not one of them. As a co-owner of Beanstock Coffee Roasters in Wellfleet, Kelly endures seasonal business cycles that are near-perfect reflections of the town’s annual population flux – in August, Beanstock does at least three times the amount of business that it does in the slowest winter months, Kelly said. Kelly and his wife both grew up on Cape Cod, and they lived in Chicago and San Francisco before returning to the Cape. While in San Francisco, Kelly admired _Peet’s Coffee_, and he wondered why there wasn’t more of that style of coffee being roasted in the Northeast. He joined Beanstock in 1999, and the roaster now has a loyal following throughout the Cape. Business grows each year, but the pace of business still shifts dramatically through the seasons. “It’s something I’ve thought about every year,” Kelly said. “For us, it really is a challenge.” From Coastal Maine to Cape Cod to the Jersey Shore to North Carolina’s Outer Banks, hundreds of cafes and roasters in popular summertime destinations face the same decision: to close during the offseason or persevere through the winter months with a fraction of the summer clientele. “There’s something to be said for the seasonal business,” said Paul Whitaker, owner of Paul’s Bean and Bagel in the Cape Cod town of Sandwich, Mass. “It’d be easier to stay motivated and charged-up if you knew you could close in December and open again in May.” But Whitaker also stays open year-round. He opened Bean and Bagel three years ago, and serving premium coffee and ice cream, he decided he’d need to be a reliable year-round presence to win over new customers. “It’s a daily obsession, and you can’t shut them off … and expect that in May that they’re all going to come back,” Whitaker said. As co-owner of the Front Porch Cafe and Kill Devil Coffee Roasters in North Carolina’s Outer Banks, Paul Manning also said it’s barely even an option to close during the slow months. The Outer Banks’ population increases about tenfold during the summer months when the Front Porch Cafes do about 40 percent more business than in the winter. But Manning said it would be hard to go from closed in the offseason to open during the summer rush. “We’ve always based our business around the local market out of necessity,” Manning said.![Sandwich Boardwalk](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/boardwalk1.CyPyftJP_Zhsm2n.webp)_Hundreds of people will traverse the Sandwich Boardwalk each day in the summer, but in the off-season, it’s a quiet place._### Winter: ‘The Unromantic Part’ Beanstock is exclusively a roasting business; they don’t run a cafe. All the same, the departure of Wellfleet’s summer crowds has a major impact on the company’s off-season business. A majority of Beanstock’s clients are on Cape Cod; many of them are on the Outer Cape and do the bulk of their business during a four-month stretch each year. Some of Beanstock’s accounts are only open in the summer, and even for the ones that are open year-round, Kelly estimates that 95 percent of them purchase less coffee during the off-season. Kelly remains busy during the winter months, albeit with different kinds of work from the rest of the year. “You’re catching up with repairs [to the machinery], which is the very unromantic part of the business,” Kelly said. There is some upside to the slower pace winter brings. It’s a time to strategize, plan, design, and perhaps experiment with some new blends. “You do have more time to have fun with it,” Kelly said. In North Carolina, Manning has a similar approach to the winter months. “We have a steady clientele,” he said. “It’s nice to have your business ramp up in the summer, but in the winter, you have time to relax a bit and work on some projects. … The pace varies, which is kind of neat.” Manning estimates that Kill Devil will roast about 50 percent more beans in July and August than in January or February. Still, there is one staffer who roasts year-round, and even in the offseason, she manages to work a steady 40 hours or so each week. For Whitaker, running Bean and Bagel is actually more difficult in the winter. He too has less business in the winter months – sometimes less than a quarter of the daily customers he has in the summer – but he also has less staff. Most of his half-dozen winter staffers are college or high-school students working one or two shifts a week. Whitaker, therefore, must be there in person seven days a week, from opening to closing time. ### Spring: ‘A Switch Is Turned’ On a late March day this year, the temperature on the Outer Banks went up into the high 70s; it fell to the 40s a day later. The pleasant days are enough to bring a small influx of budget-savvy families and college spring-breakers to the Outer Banks in March. At Front Porch, there’s a tiny uptick in business already. Manning finalizes his summertime staff at this time. When Front Porch opened in 1999, Manning said, “I had college kids applying in droves. … [Now] I only get a couple of college kids applying for a job.” These days, about half of Manning’s summer staff consists of foreign exchange students, something that has become typical of many area businesses – 5,000 foreign exchange students came to the Outer Banks to work last summer. Many of Front Porch’s summer staff hail from Eastern European countries like Lithuania, Ukraine, and Russia. Both Kelly and Whitaker said their clientele on Cape Cod doesn’t increase much until May or June. Spring in New England can be a frustrating, drawn-out time of year. Cape Cod had temperatures in the teens and the 60s in March 2008, and with hundreds of microclimates, Cape Cod’s weather will remain mercurial almost until the summer solstice. “It gets busier, but not busy enough for me to hire more people,” Whitaker said. “It’s slow, and I pretty much have to do it myself.” All the same, Whitaker’s and Kelly’s workdays are already changing as spring arrives. “At this time of year [March], a switch is turned,” Kelly said. At Beanstock, Kelly will prepare for summer accounts. At Bean and Bagel, local students who worked there in previous summers stop by and chat with Manning about working the upcoming summer. They’re all preparing for the summer rush, which will come suddenly.![Paul Whittaker](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/paul.C-AlAMY-_1abIFB.webp)_Paul Whittaker, owner of Paul’s Bean and Bagel in Sandwich, Mass. on Cape Cod_### Summer: ‘We Go All-Out’ “In the summertime, we go all-out just to keep up with demand,” Kelly said. By late June, Beanstock’s weekly business triples. “I’m not going to try a lot of new blends in the summertime. … I just don’t have the time.” On the thermometer and the calendar, summer arrives a bit earlier at the Outer Banks. “Memorial Day is really the kickoff,” Manning said. “By June 10, we’re into the full season.” Instead of the two or three morning-shift staffers during the winter months, four or five staff members will work the morning shift at Front Porch during the summer. From that point on, Manning tries to keep five days ahead of the elements. He views extended weather forecasts throughout the season because as busy as nice summer days are at Front Porch, rainy summer days bring even more customers to the cafe. “It’s all you can do to keep up,” Manning said. He tries to be prepared and asks staffers to come in on the foul-weather days, even if they have an off-day scheduled. They’ll typically get a bonus, and it’s well worth the expense for Manning. “It’s all hands on deck,” he said. Same with Bean and Bagel, where Whitaker’s staff is doubled and the total payroll hours of his staff nearly quadrupled. “The difference is dramatic, and it actually makes it easier to run a business,” Whitaker said. “I don’t have to be there every minute.” He can delegate more, and somebody on his staff opens the shop on some mornings. One part that’s tougher in the summer is keeping pace with inventory. Something that lasts a month in Bean and Bagel during the winter tends to be gone in one week during peak season. Both Manning and Whitaker said there’s a different atmosphere with the summer clientele. On the Outer Banks, said Manning, people have come to relax, but it can take a while before they adjust. The morning rush begins later, usually from 10-11 a.m. “If it’s a really nice beach day, it will be pretty quiet around lunch until the afternoon,” Manning said. People will stop in for iced coffee later in the afternoon.” There’s also a difference in the spending habits of summer customers, Whitaker said. “The clientele that comes in during the summer … they almost want to spend their money,” he said. Year-round customers tend to want to save their money; people on vacation tend to splurge more often. ### Fall: ‘A Big Sigh of Relief’ Generations of Americans near the East Coast have known that Cape Cod and the Outer Banks are summer paradises. It remains a bit of a secret that the areas remain a paradise for a month or two after Labor Day. This, in fact, is the nicest time of year for business, according to Kelly and Manning. “The sweet spot is probably late October and November,” Kelly said. In more moderate numbers, people continue to vacation on the Cape. “There’s plenty of business, but you’re not going nonstop.” Manning also said the fall is his favorite time of year – he especially likes September after Labor Day on the Outer Banks. Although it’s the beginning of hurricane season, the water is still warm, and daytime temperatures are still often in the 80s. The business remains steady, yet the pace of life slows down to a near-offseason level. “The day after Labor Day, it’s like a big sigh of relief out here,” Manning said. “You can just feel everybody slowing down.” ### Worth the Seasonal Ups and Downs Kelly would be happy to have a steadier rate of business throughout the year. Beanstock has some customers on the far side of Cape Cod Canal, and they’d love to have more. “We’ve been trying to [do more business] off-Cape and get accounts in more year-round areas,” Kelly said. Like many Cape Cod year-rounders, though, they’re willing to endure the off-peak months because the summer months are so nice and because of the community mentality in the area throughout the year. “Whey you’re here year-round, you’re all in it together,” Kelly said. “There’s kind of a sense of helping one another out… It’s our neighbors who are drinking our coffee. I also want to do the best I can by these people.” For Whitaker, being a steady year-round presence pays off in the long run. In his third year running Bean and Bagel, winter business is up about 30 percent from last year. “[Locals] appreciate people sticking it out during the winter season,” Whitaker said. His store sells ice cream as well as coffee, and continuity helps him keep competitive in an area that’s loaded with seasonal ice cream shops. The business climate of Outer Banks makes up for much of the seasonal volatility. “It’s a great environment for a small business owner,” Manning said. “You’re not in competition with a saturation of chain stores.” Manning said that he and many other year-round residents feel that there’s something to enjoy about the winter season. “From a residential point of view, I love the fact that we live on the edge of the continent,” Manning said. “It’s pretty neat to walk on the beach in the winter and not see a single person.” Published on April 1, 2008--- #### Alex Scofield Alex Scofield is a freelance writer who lives in Cape Cod, Mass.

# Cafézinho (Coffee Brazilian Style) [Brewing Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/brewing-coffee/)---by [Sheila Thomson](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/sheila-thomson/)![Cafézinho (Coffee Brazilian Style)](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/cafezinho-coffee-brazilian-style/mancebo3001.jpg) One could sit here and write volumes about coffee in Brazil, but if you want to read a good book about it, go to your local library and look for a copy of _Vassouras: A Brazilian Coffee County, 1850-1890. The Roles of Planter and Slave in a Changing Society._ Stanley J. Stein. New York: Atheneum, 1976. Instead, we’ll tell you a little about cafézinho, a word that more than being a diminutive for coffee (cafe, in Portuguese) is almost a synonym for _welcome_ in Brazil. Wherever you go, the minute you walk in the door, someone will pop the question _would you like a cafézinho?_ and they won’t take no for an answer. Or maybe they won’t even ask and the cafézinho will soon materialize on a dainty tray brought in by a maid. In offices, someone will come by and pour cafézinhos at people’s desks, so don’t be surprised if, smack in the middle of a business discussion, your Brazilian counterpart offers you a little coffee, too. And, at that point, the conversation may well switch to a non-business topic while you sip away. You’ll even be offered a _cafézinho_ while shopping at H. Stern and other ultra-sophisticated stores and boutiques. Or you can “belly up to the bar” at any of the countless places that serve _cafézinho_, order one, and sip away while standing on the sidewalk. If you can spare the time, sit at a table in any of the fabulous cafes where tiny, scrumptious little cookies or sugar-dipped orange peel are always placed next to your cup.![cafezinho](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/mancebo3001.DcWRBxXl_Z1S8i1Q.webp)_Cafézinho – The antique coffee maker pictured here comes from the state of Minas Gerais, home to Milton Nascimento and many other world-renowned musicians. The cloth strainer fits in the hole, and the coffee pot sits right underneath it._ Here’s a traditional recipe for Brazilian _cafézinho_ passed on from generation to generation. I have a Brazilian friend in Miami Beach who still makes coffee like this. For each cup of water, use a heaping Tbsp of good coffee ground for espresso. The recipe also calls for sugar to taste. (You’ll need a saucepan that you’ll promise to use ONLY for making coffee.) This is how it’s done: 1. Add the water to the pan, add the sugar, and dissolve well. 2. Bring to a boil over medium heat. 3. When the water and sugar mixture boils, add the coffee powder, stir well, and pour through a traditional cloth coffee strainer (or a paper filter). 4. Pour immediately into a tiny cup. Espresso cups can now be found rather easily in the U.S. Cloth coffee strainers can be found in markets and supermarkets in Brazil and in Latino stores in the U.S. Ah, if you can bring home the micro spoons decorated with Brazilian semi-precious stones – Brazilians usually find them the epitome of kitsch – you’ll wow your guests every time! You’ll find them in souvenir shops in Rio and at major airports.

# Caffeine Sensitivity in Coffee [Coffee and Health](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/coffee-health/)---by [Len Brault](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/len-brault/)![Caffeine Sensitivity in Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/caffeine-sensitivity-in-coffee/caffeine-molecule.png) This is an article for people who want, or need, to understand more about caffeine, their problems reacting to coffee, and what to do about it. There is no reason why caffeine sensitivity should prevent you from enjoying a delicious cup of coffee. You can drastically reduce your caffeine intake simply by understanding more about the varieties of beans and the various methods of production, brewing, and decaffeination._(If you have been diagnosed by a doctor and told that you should not drink coffee or have caffeine in any form, please do NOT read any further. Listen to your doctor. This article should not be construed as competent medical advice to persons who are dangerously sensitive to caffeine or coffee.)_ Caffeine is a benign chemical that is well-tolerated by most people. It provides its “lift” by preventing the normal action of a substance called adenosine. In most people, this is a temporary effect that has little impact on the body. While the very small percentage of people who have severe reactions to caffeine should avoid it altogether, there are many more who simply have some problem sleeping if they drink coffee too late in the day or have other mild symptoms. For these people, there is a lot that can be done to enjoy coffee without having these problems. As a food, most studies agree that coffee is rich in antioxidants and other healthy substances. The possible negative factors are generally associated with over-roasted coffee or other improper processing– they are not actually inherent in coffee itself, which is considered to be a healthy drink in moderation. Many economists have noted that coffee as a mild stimulant has done billions of dollars of good in enhancing the national gross productivity, and that coffee has probably saved many lives by keeping people alert when they might otherwise be drowsy.![espresso](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/espresso-on-white-saucer1.BSETCcfF_Z1hSns7.webp)_Espresso_ That being said, people who drink too much coffee are getting too much of a good thing, and beyond 16-20 ounces a day or so of coffee, people can develop a dependency on the caffeine and may suffer withdrawal symptoms like headache or lack of energy if they skip their daily coffee. Caffeine also has diuretic effects and can be bad for anybody who is already critically low in electrolytes or has a condition that would make any diuretic a harmful thing. There are many foods with a similar diuretic effect, like vinegar, cucumbers, watermelon, artichokes, etc. ### When people have a problem with coffee, what symptoms do they associate with it? - Sleeplessness - Nervousness, jittery feelings - Irregular heartbeats - Upset stomach, acid reflux, etc. - Intestinal cramping or other muscle cramping - Diuretic effect, dehydration ### How much caffeine is actually in coffee? Unlike soft drinks or foods with set caffeine levels, there is no set concentration of caffeine in coffee. Different varieties of coffee beans contain different levels of caffeine. Arabica beans range from 1.2% to 1.8%, Robusta beans can reach as high as 2.4%. Also, many processing factors can increase or decrease the amount of caffeine in coffee. See the table below to see a comparison of the amounts of caffeine in various types of coffee and other products. ### Approximate caffeine levels in coffee and other products (for similar portions): - Robusta coffee (drip brewed): 140 – 200 mg caffeine per 6 ounces average cup - Arabica coffee (drip brewed): 75 – 130 mg average 6-ounce cup - Espresso (typical serving): 30 – 50 mg average 1-ounce shot - Instant coffee: 40 – 100 mg average 6-ounce cup - 97% decaf coffee: 3 – 6 mg caffeine per 6-7 ounces average cup - 99.92% Euro decaf standard coffee: 8 – 16 mg caffeine per 6-7 ounce average cup - Hot cocoa: 10 – 15 mg caffeine per 6-7 ounce cup - Coke, Pepsi, Mountain Dew soda: 20 – 26 mg caffeine per 6-7 ounce drink - Green tea (brewed): 12 – 30 mg per 6-7 ounce average cup - Black tea (brewed): 40 – 60 mg per 6-7 ounce average cup These are averages and do not reflect specific teas or chocolates, nor are they adjusted for brewing times, etc. They are presented here just as a rough comparative guide.) Sources: USFDA and Nat. Soft Drink Assoc._Note that 99.2% Euro standard decaf actually has more caffeine than 97% FDA standard decaf. It’s not a typo; it’s simply due to different methods of measurement. See “Is decaf really decaf?” for more information._### Is caffeine always the culprit? Surprisingly, the answer is often no. Many people think that they have reactions to caffeine when they actually are sensitive to other coffee characteristics, such as dark roasts. In the thousands of contacts we have had with the public at our product demos and taste testings, people who tell us they have trouble with coffee’s caffeine will admit that they have no trouble with caffeinated sodas, black tea, cocoa, chocolate, and other foods with relatively high caffeine levels. And many people have told us that switching to decaf has not solved their problems. To find out if your problem with coffee is really with the caffeine, simply note whether the other foods on the above chart give you the problems you associate with coffee. If not, the caffeine isn’t the problem.![ode to Caffeine](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/12Caffeine-06.B8e8Dvvt_Z7yf1.webp) ### If the problem is not caffeine, what is it? Coffee in itself is a mild and palatable food and few people have sensitivities to the food aspect of coffee. However, once you roast a coffee bean, you necessarily begin to create some substances that a few people will find indigestible. Dark roasting coffee breaks down the sugars and oils, and it burns them to varying degrees, creating ash material within the beans. These people react very strongly to these burnt sugars and oils, typically experiencing stomach acid, cramps, heart palpitations, and other autonomic symptoms. Despite the similarity of these symptoms to caffeine sensitivity, they are having a food intolerance issue. Because coffee is a dried food there is always the possibility of mold or other contaminants in coffee causing an allergy. However, the vast majority of producers are meticulously careful to keep their coffee clean and free of contaminants and maintain the correct humidity levels. So this is seldom a problem with good coffee. ### Is decaf really decaf? Rumors abound. We have had many people tell us, with a conspiratorial air, that “decaf isn’t really decaf, you know, it has quite a bit of caffeine in it!” This is why, they explain, they can’t drink decaf either. It is true that decaf still has some caffeine remaining, but generally not very much. There are FDA and European Union legal requirements for labeling a coffee “decaffeinated.” To meet the FDA standard, 97% of the original caffeine must be removed. A typical cup of coffee might contain 60-120 milligrams of caffeine. A cup with 90 milligrams of caffeine in it would contain less than 3 milligrams after decaffeination. Coffee that meets the 99.92% EU standard contains slightly more caffeine because it uses a different standard to measure the amount that has been removed. The FDA requires that 97% of the caffeine be removed from the coffee, while the Eu requires that the beans be 99.92% caffeine-free by mass. Of course, the variety of the coffee bean affects the caffeine level before and after. Robusta coffees can have 30% more caffeine than Arabica. Excelsa or Catimor coffees can have as little as 10% of the caffeine of Robusta. Even within varieties, the caffeine content can vary as much as 30%. This means that there is significant variation in the end product. However, no product properly labeled “decaffeinated” to 97% or 99.92% can possibly have more caffeine than cola, chocolate, or green tea. Not every manufacturer can be counted on to be completely honest about decaffeination, however. Enforcement of decaf standards is virtually nonexistent. Be sure to evaluate the specificity of the decaf claim on the coffee. If the claim seems vague (“99.9% caffeine-free!” without any supporting information), be wary. ### What do they mean by “natural decaf”? Sadly, much misleading labeling exists here. It is actually completely legal to call a decaf method “100% natural water process decaf” and find that the coffee has been subjected to successive chemical soakings. In this method, the coffee beans are first steamed for 30 minutes, then repeatedly rinsed with either methylene chloride (commonly known as a basis for paint stripper) or ethyl acetate (commonly known as a dry cleaning fluid) for about 10 hours. The solvent is then drained away and the beans are steamed for an additional 10 hours in an attempt to remove any residual solvent. Sometimes coffee decaffeinated using ethyl acetate is referred to as naturally processed because ethyl acetate can be derived from various fruits or vegetables. However, for the purpose of decaffeination, it is not generally possible to create such a large quantity of ethyl acetate, and thus the chemical is synthetically derived. Note that this process also denatures the coffee to some degree and removes many of the flavor elements as well. Needless to say, this and other chemical processes that are labeled as “natural” can have serious issues of tolerance for people with sensitive stomachs or allergies. The only water process that could really be labeled as “natural” is the expensive, patented Swiss water process, performed by only one plant in the world, in Canada. A batch of green, unroasted beans is soaked in hot water, absorbing the caffeine and coffee solids from the bean. Then the beans are discarded and the water is run through a carbon filter that traps the caffeine molecules. The remaining water is then used to soak another batch of coffee beans. The water absorbs more caffeine from these beans, but cannot soak up any more coffee solids or flavor, which stay in the beans. The water is then drained away. The process is repeated until the beans are 99.9% caffeine-free. Other decaffeination processes include CO2 processing, used by Koffie Kan, in which the coffee beans are soaked in a liquid bath of carbon dioxide at 73 to 300 atmospheric pressures; and the triglyceride method, in which the beans are soaked in coffee oils removed from spent coffee grounds.![Caffeine Molecule](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/caffeine-molecule.F-LD1Lte_ZQpRTf.webp) ### Other methods to reduce the caffeine in coffee_**Brewing at a lower temperature:**_ Lowering the average brewing temperature will produce coffee that contains less caffeine. Coffee made in a French Press or a Vietnamese filter brewer is brewed at a lower average temperature over most of the brewing time._**Brewing faster/switching to espresso:**_ Reducing the brewing time will also produce a lower-caffeine cup of coffee. The French Press and Vietnamese filter brewers are faster than the average machine brewer. In espresso machines, brewing is very fast. A shot of espresso has less caffeine than an 8 oz. of regular coffee but the same amount of flavor. Even if you don’t like espresso shots, try making an “espressocino” or American espresso._**Switching to instant coffee:**_ Instant coffees typically have less caffeine than regular coffee because they are processed with lower heat than regular. You don’t need to settle for the jar of instant in your local grocery store; search out Ipoh White Coffee King, Vinacafe, or G7 Instant for great flavor and a mellow brew. ### Recommendations_**For those who are only slightly sensitive:**_ You may only need to change your brewing methods and reduce your caffeine intake from other foods, as I outlined above. What are you waiting for? It’s easy! Go and enjoy some coffee._**For the sensitive:**_ Your options are the most limited. Not only should you reduce your caffeine intake from daily foods, but you’ll have to drink decaf as well. But don’t despair! There is decent coffee that meets FDA or EU decaffeination standards if you know where to look. Consider the Komodo Dragon and Organic Twilight, or search out other coffees processed by the Swiss decaffeination process. Those sensitive to caffeine have many options to reduce their intake while still enjoying a tasty cup of coffee. On a typical day, you can drop your caffeine intake by 200 mg per day or more, to under 100 mg, just by choosing your non-coffee foods wisely and choosing coffee types with less caffeine, such as espresso, instant, or naturally low caffeine beans. You can reduce possible reactions to acid, burnt sugars, and oils by choosing coffee roasted at lower temperatures. By making good choices during the day, you may experience coffee nirvana again, without any distress. Enjoy! ### Resources Caffeine Dependence [PDF](http://web.archive.org/web/20160904083133/http://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/psychiatry/research/BPRU/docs/Caffeine_Dependence_Fact_Sheet.pdf) General info about decaffeination: [Wikipedia on decaffeination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decaffeination) Swiss Water Process: [Wikipedia on Swiss Water Process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decaffeination#Swiss_Water_process) Chemicals in decaffeinated coffee: FDA Food Additive Status List (search for “decaf”) Decaffeination standards: _FDA statement on caffeine in decaf (page removed from FDA site)__Original Title: Your favorite drink upsets you?

He would find the best heirloom coffees that remained largely undiscovered and unchanged by Western influence and showcase these coffees on the Internet. The search led him to Southeast Asian coffees (primarily Vietnamese and Philippine), established a century or more ago and still being cultivated, processed and brewed locally in traditional manners from an era gone by, unknown to the industry, markets, and media in the USA and Canada. Since that time Len has evaluated thousands of coffees in a continuing search for the original, traditional, and unspoiled, and expanded to unique Latin American coffees as well. He has undertaken the task of writing about these coffees, the cultures from which they came, and the manners in which they are brewed and enjoyed. His comment? “It’s a rough job, but somebody has to do it.” His company, Len’s Coffee, is devoted to helping indigenous producers gain access to international distribution under their own brand names so that they achieve the most “fair” of all trades, which is, eliminating commodities brokers and receiving all the fruits of their own labors. The overriding principle that guides his company is the belief that coffee, the second-highest-volume traded commodity in the world, has a tremendous and largely untapped potential to engineer social change and improve the quality of life for millions of people around the globe simply by the practice of making better choices, on the wholesale and consumer levels.

# Caffeine: Physical and Psychological Effects [Coffee and Health](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/coffee-health/)---by [Robert Badgett](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/robert-badgett/)![Caffeine: Physical and Psychological Effects](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/caffeine-physical-and-psychological-effects/caffeine-molecule.png) Caffeine is classified as a methylxanthine, along with theobromine and theophylline. Of these three chemicals, caffeine had the greatest stimulant effect on the central nervous system and the skeletal muscles, and the least effect on the cardiovascular system. The absorption of caffeine is rapid. Its effects take about 30 minutes, which is the time the peak blood levels are reached. Maximal central nervous system effects take about 2 hours and caffeine’s half-life is about 3 hours. (Remember the 10-2 and 4 ads for Dr. Pepper?) It is metabolized almost completely, with only 10% or less being excreted from the body unchanged.![Dr. Pepper 10-2-4 Vintage Sign ](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/dr-pepper-10-2-41.CQvtmZjK_1iaXjI.webp)_[Dr. Pepper 10-2-4 Vintage Sign](http://www.flickr.com/photos/brent_nashville/5789164343/in/photostream/) sign by Brent Moore_ Caffeine’s stimulant action on the central nervous system is caused by its ability to block the brain’s neuroreceptors for adenosine. Adenosine itself acts as a neuromodulator to produce behavioral sedation in several areas of the brain by inhibiting the release of neurotransmitters. By inhibiting adenosine’s sedative effects, caffeine causes stimulation. Low doses of about 200 mg of caffeine cause reduced drowsiness and fatigue in most individuals. The stimulant effect on skeletal muscles increases the body’s ability to perform physically exhausting work for longer periods of time. The same dose of 200 mg keeps most people awake longer and causes sleep disturbances.![Caffeine Molecule](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/caffeine-molecule.F-LD1Lte_ZQpRTf.webp)_Caffeine Molecule_ Caffeine’s stimulant qualities caused the National Academy of Sciences’ Institute of Medicine to recommend ways to add caffeine to U.S. soldiers’ rations. Since caffeine might give an athlete an unfair advantage, the U.S. Olympic Committee considers it a “performance enhancer”, and regularly screens athletes for the drug.- from a paper presented at Penn State University by Robert L. Badgett- also published in _Badgett’s Coffee eJournal_, Issue 4, June 16, 2000 Published on April 1, 2002--- #### Robert Badgett Robert Badgett recently retired the long running Badgett’s Coffee eJournal, a biweekly email journal that promotes good coffee: buying, brewing, and home roasting our most wonderful beverage.

# Can the Philips Saeco Syntia Deliver Espresso Perfection? [Espresso](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/espresso/)---by [Chris Arnold](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/chris-arnold/) Anyone who has had a great espresso or cappuccino at a local coffee shop, while traveling to Europe, or even from their own semi-auto espresso machine has probably dreamed of a machine that can do all that grinding, tamping, pulling, and steaming on its own. There are a lot of Super-Auto espresso machines that try to make good on this promise. The Philips Saeco HD8838/47 is one of them. Does it deliver? Read on to find out. ### What’s in the Box? Philips-Saeco really delivers a complete package. There is of course the main unit and power cord, but also a plethora of paperwork and manuals, coffee scoop, a water filter, a water test strip, and a tube of grease for monthly lubrication of the brew group.![saeco machine](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/saeco-machine1.0aIcEmER_rzSn.webp)_Philips-Saeco_### Looks & Build Quality The sides and top are quite handsome, being made of brushed metal. The buttons, knobs, and spout are also a silver color, but are sadly cheap, shiny, chintzy plastic. If these had been made of metal, or even classy matte-black rubberized plastic, it certainly would have enhanced the entire experience. Instead, it ruins the experience the minute you touch them. And it makes the labels on the buttons hard to read. Not good Saeco.![saeco controls](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/saeco-controls.B9-HYR2h_2penuK.webp)_Saeco Controls_### Instructional Material![saeco documentation](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/saeco-1.COB4toI2_vycR2.webp)_Saeco Instructional Material_ As the story goes, Steve Jobs said that none of his computers should require a user manual to use, and most Apple users would probably agree with that, at least to some degree. I think Philips-Saeco wanted to turn this saying on its head and provide you with no less than 9 different sheets or booklets if you are an English speaker. And the main manual is not intuitive. The sheer number of languages is sort of confusing, since they split them up differently, depending on the item you are looking at. There is some duplication across some of the sheets, some are scaled differently; it is just weird. A single, unified manual would be a much better experience. ### User Interface / User Experience (UI/UX)![Saeco Warming Up](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/saeco-warming-up.D_YlMnoh_ZGk0S8.webp)_Saeco Warming Up_ This is where it starts to get real ugly. To start there is a multi-colored LCD (only one color at a time), that appears at the center of the user experience. Depending on what is happening, the color is Green, Orange, or Red. Outside the 4 corners of this LCD, there are 4 buttons that have icons on them but also double as “Soft” buttons depending on what is shown on the LCD. 2 of the buttons have the word “Memo” on them. Confusing if you ask me since I am not sure what “Memo” really means… Below that there is a dial with 3 positions, and has its own button in the center of the dial with an icon of a cappuccino cup and the word “Memo”. Again, not sure what Memo means, and why is it on 3 of the buttons? Also, why would you have totally different button locations for a cappuccino than for espresso? I tend to use my espresso machines as much for coffee and milk, as I do for the hot water function. No dedicated button for that I am sorry to say. Instead, you perform a combination of presses to get some simple hot water. Too bad. The UI/UX is just weird, confusing, and unintuitive. Let’s put it this way – this UI is from the school of “How to drive anyone (even a computer geek) crazy”. I pretty much needed the manual for everything. I really cannot imagine a worse UI/UX, though I am sure it exists somewhere. Make no mistake about it, this is a user experience from hell. And I didn’t even believe in hell before using this thing. ### Coffee Quality![Saeco Espresso Pull](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/saeco-espresso-pull.DGY_YE0y_2k7F2V.webp)_Saeco Espresso Pull_ So the UI/UX is bad. What about the quality of the coffee? You start by filling the water tank and putting some beans in the hopper. One nice touch is that the hopper is very well sealed, so you could keep beans in there for a few days, and in theory, they should stay pretty fresh. The hopper has a cool shaking/vibration action that makes all the beans get down into the throat of the hopper very nicely. Would like to see this on some of the high-end espresso grinders, especially on oily beans that refuse to get down there.![Saeco Water Tank](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/saeco-water-tank.BaSS05J5_ZxfBzc.webp)_Saeco Water Tank_![Saeco Milk Tank](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/saeco-milk-tank.BD5DzMEl_Z1GATJT.webp)_Saeco Milk Tank_![Saeco Grinder](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/saeco-grinder.DYrYo8vC_ZJO0zW.webp)_Saeco Grinder_ The strength of coffee can be adjusted in a couple of ways. You can adjust the grinder finer or coarser. There is also a Mild, Medium, and Strong setting that can be set in the menu. You can also use the “Strong” button (which uses less water to coffee ratio than the “Long” button). You can also program the ratio of water to coffee to be less or more, and finally, you could use your own pre-ground coffee, in the event the built-in grinder is not grinding to your liking. I started with the defaults, with a “Strong” double. As soon as the shot is started, it decided to dump some water in the bottom of my cup before a stream of actual coffee came out. Unfortunately, this was not a one-time thing; it does it every time, which is not good. Who wants extra water in their espresso shot? I am a straight espresso drinker, and I use my current manual espresso machine as a comparison for flavor (an old Pasquini Livia 90). I always use good water and freshly roasted beans, along with a commercial-grade espresso grinder. Of course, the Livia produces a thick, rich crema layer, and wonderful tasting espresso found underneath. How about the Syntia?![Saeco Ready to Pull Espresso](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/saeco-ready-to-pull-shot.CqEvAFpj_1dN835.webp)_Saeco Ready to Pull Espresso_ Initially, the espresso that the Saeco-Philips produced had a very light layer of crema and a very watery-tasting espresso. So I adjusted the strength to the highest setting and, eventually, the built-in grinder to the finest setting. The result was not much better. I then went on to try a couple more things. I was able to reduce the amount of water to coffee ratio per shot. Didn’t help much either. So, lastly, I thought I would try the pre-ground option. I used my commercial-grade espresso grinder, and again, no love. There is something they call the “Saeco Adapting System”, which they claim adjusts over time to “Optimize Extraction”. Well, I did over a dozen shots, and nothing seemed to change for the better. So the Adapting System seems like more of a gimmick than anything. In a word, the espresso was underwhelming. Not undrinkable, but certainly not inspiring. I can only surmise that it has something to do with the strength of the pump used, and perhaps the automatic tamper. We know these are some of the keys to really good espresso. I also took a look at the size of the discarded pucks, and they did seem a little too small, and a little too loosely tamped, reinforcing my theory. ### Cappuccino Quality![Saeco Cappuccino](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/saeco-making-cap.DezbOnKE_Z125o4x.webp)_Saeco_ _Cappuccino_ The steps are mostly the same as straight espresso, but you add a little tank with milk on the side. Before the milk starts to get steamed, again, you get some water in the bottom of the cup. Why!?!?! Stop doing this, I thought. But sadly, they are obsessed with self-cleaning/purging, to the demise of taste in the cup. The steamed milk and foam were decent, though probably in line with what you can accomplish with a hand frother. Cleanup of the milk container was easy. The amount of espresso and strength of it was quite light, so I pulled another shot into the cup to bring some coffee flavor to the concoction. In a word, the cappuccino was disappointing. It tasted OK, though I would say certain pod machines that have milk pod options probably taste a little better. At a fraction of the price. ### Other - There are a few additional things to mention. For one, you can use pre-ground coffee through a special spout on top of the hopper lid. This is great if you already have some pre-ground coffee, or a better grinder you would like to use. - The unit has a hot water function, which is nice if you want tea or soup. ### Cleanup and Maintenance - The annoying self-cleaning features, do make cleanup easier. - There is a tray on the right side that keeps all the spent espresso grounds. It holds a fair amount of coffee grounds and is easy to empty and clean. - The unit has a descaling mode, which can be performed with Saeco-approved liquid (not included). - There is a nice door on the side, that allows the user to lubricate the Brew Group, or to remove it and clean it. - Using the provided scoop along with the insanely small opening for pre-ground coffee results in about half of the coffee on the outside of the machine. Saeco should have made the opening bigger or rigged it with a funnel-like opening, which is larger on top. Also, the coffee doesn’t all go down the chute, so you have to sort of push it down with your finger. Awful. - With the dispensing spout adjusted down, using the milk steam function causes hot milk to be splattered into an area that is not taken care of by the auto clean, and is a total pain to clean. ### Pros - Just about everything you need is included, even grease for lubrication of the brew group on a monthly basis. - Coffee Bean Hopper is sealed very well, meaning you can leave your beans in there, and be sure that no air will get to them. This translates to fresh coffee beans. - Coffee Bean Hopper has a vibrating action that ensures beans are fed reliably into the hopper throat. ### Cons - The Water Tray is very small, which means frequent emptying. - The Water Tank is very small, which means frequent refilling. - Every time you power on the machine, it decides to spit out a few ounces of water, which could be a problem if the tray is already full. - Every time you power off the machine, it decides to auto clean and spits out a few ounces of water, which could be a problem if the tray is already full. - When pulling shots, some water is purged into your cup, meaning a more watered-down espresso. - When steaming milk, the cleanup is really a pain due to the shape of the delivery spout. ### Conclusion So how did the Philips Saeco Syntia HD8838/47 fare? Not so good. A bad user experience, with really great espresso, might be a reason to buy. A really good user experience, with sub-par coffee, might be OK for Grandpa. But in this case, Philips Saeco executed poorly on both. Wait for the next model, and perhaps they can fix the current problems.![Saeco Espresso](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/saeco-espresso.DM2cpPhU_1Qlzzo.webp)_Saeco Espresso_***Disclosure:** The author of this article was loaned the equipment in this article in exchange for this review.* Published on October 16, 2011--- #### Chris Arnold Chris is the creator of Two Bit History.

# Camping Showdown: Steeped Coffee vs The Bripe Coffee Pipe [Brewing Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/brewing-coffee/)---by [Michael Allen Smith](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/michael-allen-smith/)![Camping Showdown: Steeped Coffee vs The Bripe Coffee Pipe](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/camping-showdown-steeped-coffee-vs-bripe-coffee-pipe/CoffeeCampingShowdown.jpg) Recently, I received two new coffee brewing items in the mail to review. Both brewing methods seemed like they might be candidates for a camping trip or other trips where one needs to make coffee without electricity. Steeped Coffee is an idea that I’m surprised hasn’t happened before. **Steeping coffee in a tea bag.** If someone else had tried this before and were successful, it wouldn’t have made it on my radar. With Steeped Coffee, you only need a mug and some hot water. If you want to reduce your backpacking load, I don’t think you can get lighter than this.![Steeped Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/steeped-coffee-medum.Bvj6dleB_Z1dW6Ak.webp)_Steeped Coffee – California Blend_ The Bripe is the most bizarre yet intriguing coffee brewer I have ever seen. It is a pipe where you sip the coffee from a metal straw. The coffee is brewed by heating the base with a portable blue-flame torch. At first glance, brewing and consuming coffee from the Bripe almost looks illegal. Flames and pipes will do that. The second thing it reminded me of was how I saw Yerba Mate being consumed in Uruguay and Argentina, so the idea wasn’t too foreign.![Bripe Coffee Brewer](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/bripe-setup.2FfABd59_Yyqxz.webp)_The Bripe_![guampa y bombilla](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/yerba-mate-drinking.DwRNpMVU_24PE9C.webp)_Yerba Mate is often consumed in a container called a guampa with a straw called a bombilla._### Making Steeped Coffee Steeped Coffee is perhaps the easiest coffee brewing of all time. Instant Coffee is the only thing close. Add hot water to a mug. Dunk the Steeped Coffee bag a few times in the water. Wait 4-5 minutes. Remove the bag and consume. That’s it.![Steeped Coffee Brewing](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/steeped-finished.Boi6CnOj_Z7s7JD.webp)_Steeped Coffee steeping_### Making Bripe Coffee Before you do anything, you’ll need to fill the quad jet torch that ships with the Bripe. It requires butane. Once you have that loaded, you are ready to go. 1. Add the filter inside the Bripe, making sure the hole connecting the straw portion has a filter covering it. 2. Add 5 grams of ground coffee. 3. Add enough water to cover the grounds and almost reach the top, about 30 grams. 4. Stir the coffee and water. 5. Proceed to heat the coffee with the torch. Bring the temperature up to 185° F. 6. Remove the torch and place the Bripe on the stand. Let it cool to 140° F. 7. Sip coffee from the straw. Afterward, you must follow the cleaning instructions to prep the Bripe for the next brew. The Bripe comes with some warnings. After all, you will be aiming a flame at the brewer. Don’t burn yourself. ### Review The Steeped Coffee was good. Not great. It was a solid blend that exceeded my expectations of what to expect from a pre-ground bagged coffee. If I were away from my kitchen, it would be good enough for my needs. I preferred the California Blend, which is a medium roast over the Odyssey Blend, which is a dark roast. If space were a premium, Steeped Coffee would be an excellent option. I could see having a few of these in the car for a long road trip or when visiting family. The Bripe is the most inefficient coffee brewer I have ever tried. After setting up the brew, it takes a few minutes to heat the coffee. Then, a few minutes to cool. All this for a single ounce of coffee. Not espresso. Brewed coffee. If you wanted to drink a 10-ounce coffee, it would take over an hour of heating, cooling, and cleaning. Ridiculous. Plus, it costs around $75 USD, which is a pricey way to brew an ounce of coffee at a time. The Bripe can also be used to make tea, which makes more sense since good teas can support multiple steeps. I could see drinking puer tea or a nice oolong in the Bripe much more than coffee. In the battle between Steeped Coffee and The Bripe, the clear winner is Steeped Coffee. ### Resources [Making Coffee With the Cowboy Joe Coffee Brewer](https://ineedcoffee.com/making-coffee-with-the-cowboy-joe-coffee-brewer/) – Review and tutorial of a pour-over coffee brewer ideal for camping._Title photo by  [Julius Ulbrich](https://unsplash.com/@juliusulbrich)._ Published on January 20, 2018--- #### Michael Allen Smith Michael Allen Smith is both a coffee fanatic and a web developer.

# Calculating the Cost Per Cup of Tea [Coffee Business](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/coffee-business/)---by [Marcus Stout](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/marcus-stout/)![Calculating the Cost Per Cup of Tea](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/calculating-the-cost-per-cup-of-tea/japanese-green-tea1.jpg) John D. Rockefeller is universally known as one of the best businesspeople of all time and was recently named the wealthiest person of all time. He revolutionized the petroleum business by understanding exactly how much everything costs in his business. He said he could tell you the cost of refining oil down to installing every nail in each barrel. And this was in the late 1800s, long before computers were invented. If you are in the tea business, you should know how much each serving of tea is costing you. This knowledge can tell you which teas are profitable, which ones are not, and which ones you can sell and still make money with. Before you can determine what each serving costs, you need to figure out what the serving size of each cup of tea is.![Japanese green tea](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/japanese-green-tea1.DF4d1ZS-_Z1JbRKr.webp)_Japanese Tea Class – Teacup_### What is the serving size of tea? The first thing you need to know is tea is traditionally served in 6oz cups. This is due to the fact people generally sip tea, not guzzle it. The second thing you have to do is determine the amount of tea to use. If you are using a scale, the recommended amount of tea per teacup is 2.5 grams per 6oz cup. For most people, a heaping teaspoon will equal roughly that. ### How many cups come in a pound of tea? A pound of tea will make 181 cups of tea. The way we get this is by converting pounds to grams and dividing by the 2.5 grams serving size. > 1 pound = 453 grams 2.5 grams of tea per cup Divide 453 (1 lb) by 2.5 (grams per serving) and you have 181.2 cups of tea per pound**So, how do I figure out how much each cup costs?** To determine how much each cup of tea costs, you need to do some division. Since we already determined that each pound of tea has 181 cups of tea, what you need to do is divide the total weight of the tea you are buying by 181, for example. If you want to purchase a pound of tea for $30, you would divide $30 (the price of the tea) by 181 (the total cups in a pound) for a total cost per cup. The general equation is: > (Cost per Pound of Tea) / 181 = Cost Per Cup ### What happens if you buy less than a pound? If you are buying less than a pound, most American tea companies measure in ounces. Since 1 pound is equal to 16 ounces, you need to divide (181 cups per pound) by 16 to get the total cups per ounce. This equation will tell you that there are 11 cups per ounce of tea. Once you know this, the equation is: > (Cost of tea) / (Ounces of tea * 11) = Cost Per Cup For example, of you buy 4 ounces of tea at $12, the equation would be $12 / (4*11) = 27 cents per cup**This looks like a lot of math. Is there a simpler way of figuring this out?** There is a much simpler way. Luckily many websites will give you this information. This will prevent you from having to use a calculator just to find out the CPC. Cost per cup is just one step in understanding the costs of your tea program. Whether it is tea or nails, the more we know about our business, the faster we can grow it. Just ask John D. Rockefeller. Published on July 19, 2010--- #### Marcus Stout

# Can Pregnant and Nursing Mothers Drink Coffee? [Coffee and Health](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/coffee-health/)---by [Bethany Ramos](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/bethany-ramos/)![Can Pregnant and Nursing Mothers Drink Coffee?](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/can-pregnant-and-nursing-mothers-drink-coffee/Nursing-Coffee-.jpg) One moment you’re jumping for joy at the thought of welcoming a new life into the world, and the next, you’ve hit a wall – a little something called caffeine withdrawal. As any expecting mother can tell you, the excitement of pregnancy brings with it a long list of contraindications: foods, drinks, substances, and activities that you absolutely “must” avoid at all costs or risk harm to your unborn baby. But before we buy into all the pregnancy scare tactics, it’s time to get down to the truth of the matter. Yes, it’s important to do everything in your power to protect your little one on the way, but abstinence from your favorite foods and drinks may make pregnancy unbearable for some women. So what’s the answer? Can you have coffee while pregnant, or is it the devil’s brew? ### Caffeine Guidelines for Pregnant Women When you start to do a little digging about how much coffee, if any, you can drink while pregnant, the results are mixed at best. Sigh. It may take a little more effort than first anticipated to get to the bottom of the issue. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists states that [moderate caffeine consumption](https://www.acog.org/clinical/clinical-guidance/committee-opinion/articles/2010/08/moderate-caffeine-consumption-during-pregnancy) (less than 200 mg/day) is not a contributing factor to miscarriage or preterm birth. The March of Dimes also throws in their two cents (yuk, yuk) by recommending that pregnant women drink no more than 200 mg of caffeine daily. This boils down to a single 12-ounce cup of coffee, depending upon how you brew it. Much of the reason for coffee-related concern during pregnancy is due to a popular study from 2008, showing that women who drank 200 mg or more of caffeine a day doubled their risk of miscarriage as opposed to those who abstained from caffeine.![](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/pregnant-coffee.B5_smVBn_ZS3my4.webp) However, [a study in 2016](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/public-health-nutrition/article/maternal-caffeine-intake-during-pregnancy-and-risk-of-pregnancy-loss-a-categorical-and-doseresponse-metaanalysis-of-prospective-studies/F3FC2934E398D3C7B80C3F3DBC9BFEC2) confirmed the same findings by stating that higher maternal caffeine intake was linked to a higher risk of pregnancy loss.  Although the authors stated that the results were inconclusive, this study also recommends minimizing caffeine intake. Yet [critics of the study](https://web.archive.org/web/20230721230212/https://www.thebump.com/a/pregnancy-myths-busted) point out that the researchers didn’t take into account how the coffee was brewed or what type of coffee was consumed. For instance, a heavier French roast served black will be much stronger than a typically weak cup of American coffee that may be served with cream and sugar. As you can see, the evidence for caffeine in pregnancy is conflicting. It is important to keep your baby and yourself healthy while minimizing unnecessary changes during pregnancy. This brings us back to the topic of moderation. > As a Nurse-Midwife, I advise patients to ideally stick to one cup of coffee per day. While having more than one may be acceptable occasionally, avoiding a regular high caffeine intake is essential. – Caitlin Goodwin, MSN, RN, CNM Initial caution about drinking caffeine during pregnancy began in the 1980s when the FDA published recommendations for pregnant women to limit caffeine based on results from a study where [pregnant rats exposed to caffeine](https://web.archive.org/web/20230721230212/https://www.thebump.com/a/pregnancy-myths-busted) saw harmful side effects in their fetuses. Nonetheless, the amount of caffeine consumed in the rat study was excessive at best, equivalent to **50 to 70 cups of coffee a day** for a 130-pound adult. Pregnant women can make a wise decision by doing their homework based on all the studies listed above and consulting with their doctors. In most cases, moderate consumption at up to 200 mg a day of all caffeinated substances won’t pose any issues. But we can’t close the book on caffeine just yet. After the baby is born, how much coffee can you drink while breastfeeding? ### Caffeine Guidelines for Nursing Women In a Brazilian study conducted on 885 infants born in 2004 (UPDATE 2025: link offline), researchers proved that although babies of mothers who were heavy caffeine drinkers appeared to wake more often at night compared to babies of mothers who drank little caffeine, the effect was negligible. Researchers agreed that drinking large amounts of caffeine during pregnancy and while breastfeeding didn’t affect infant sleep for three-month-old babies. To get down to the nitty-gritty, [Kelly Mom](https://kellymom.com/bf/can-i-breastfeed/lifestyle/caffeine/) once again recommends caffeine in moderation. Babies under six months may be more sensitive to caffeine in breast milk, especially if a mother avoided caffeine completely throughout her pregnancy. If a baby shows signs of caffeine sensitivity after breastfeeding, it may be wise to scale back on coffee drinking and try to increase as the baby grows older. Nonetheless, moderate caffeine consumption while breastfeeding is perfectly safe and is considered a Lactation Risk Category L2 per the guidelines from _Medications and Mother’s Milk_. When monitoring caffeine consumption as a pregnant or nursing mom, it’s important to look beyond your cup of Joe. Besides coffee, caffeine can sneak up on you from a wide variety of sources, including tea, diet soda, chocolate, and even coffee-flavored ice cream._Editor’s note: The first version of this article was written by Bethany Ramos of TheCoffeeBump in 2012.

# Can you brew coffee with a piece of aluminum foil? [Brewing Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/brewing-coffee/)---by [Michael Allen Smith](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/michael-allen-smith/)![Can you brew coffee with a piece of aluminum foil?](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/can-you-brew-coffee-with-a-piece-of-aluminum-foil/Add-a-heading.jpg) Masaru Nishioka from Japan has created some interesting items on his YouTube channel, but the one that will be the most interesting to us is how he came up with a way to convert aluminum foil into a coffee dripper. Yes, he figured out how to brew coffee with a single sheet of foil. He is going to show us how we can do it as well. ### Checklist Before we get started, confirm you have everything. 1. Kettle to heat water 2. Ground coffee 3. A mug or glass to collect the coffee 4. A sheet of aluminum foil That is it. Let us make some coffee. ### #1 Tear-Off a Sheet of Aluminum Foil In the photo below, you will see the approximate size of the foil to start with.![Tear of sheet of foil](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/brew-foil-1.CMUxDA4W_Z2e3cNN.webp) ### #2 Fold the Foil Fold the foil (10in x 20ft /11um) five times (10in → approx. 0.45in) and press it to make a smooth surface.![fold foil](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/brew-foil-2.BtXlwzbv_Z1Y34A0.webp)![foil foil 2](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/brew-foil-3.CYm8r21d_2wdqBA.webp) ### #3 Roll the Foil into a Tight Circle Roll the foil into a circle. When finished, the DIY brewer will be about 3 inches in diameter. Attach the end with food-grade safe superglue.![Roll Foil](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/brew-foil-4.COGxjNd5_1bCXYo.webp)![Make a tight roll of foil](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/brew-foil-5.CNqG2ePF_1AA0by.webp)![Finish roll of foil](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/brew-foil-6.Dcf89wpF_Z2c5tw.webp) ### #4 Form the Dripper Cone Press into the rolled foil slowly and gently to create the cone shape. If you press too hard or too far, it will fall apart.![Push DIY filter into cone](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/brew-foil-7.CxCX6iUQ_Zd9rsW.webp) ### #5 Make Coffee Now that the DIY Dripper is finished, we can make some coffee. As you can see from the photo and the video below, the dripper will fit over the glass or mug. Here you will use the standard brewing instructions common with other pour-over coffee methods such as the [stainless steel pour-over drippers](https://ineedcoffee.com/making-pour-over-coffee/). No paper filters are needed. Start with medium-ground coffee. If the coffee brews too fast and tastes weak, tighten up the grind. If the coffee brews too slowly and becomes over-extracted, use a more coarse grind.![Brew Coffee with Foil](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/brew-foil-8.DG-zio28_ZPXmJ0.webp)![Completed Brew](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/brew-foil-9.BN9M9ztY_8bz2q.webp) After brewing, you can throw your used coffee grounds into a compost bin. The DIY Dripper can be rinsed and used again, but it should be dried out between uses. If you decide to make coffee with your brewer in this method, you do so at your own risk. Don’t burn yourself in hot water. You might want to test your brewing out first with cold water to confirm it was folded and rolled correctly. ### Video Tutorial [_DIY Coffee Dripper (2 minutes)_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMgpq954-Xg) ### Last Words Sometimes when we travel or go camping, we need to conserve as much space as possible for our coffee gear. A single sheet of aluminum foil takes up no space. Thank you, Masaru, for sharing your coffee brewer with INeedCoffee. Masaru is also using the same technique to make an aluminum sake cup with URUSHI (Japanese lacquer), aluminum foil, and an aluminum closure forsake. This technique is called “Kentai” in Japan. ### Resources [Aluminum Foil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aluminium_foil) – Wikipedia page, which covers the thickness measurements of different types of foil.

# Candy, Flowers… and Coffee? [Cafe Culture](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/cafe-culture/)---by [Alex Scofield](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/alex-scofield/)![Candy, Flowers… and Coffee?](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/candy-flowers-and-coffee/zoka-latte-art1.jpg) Coffee rarely seems to wind up on lists of aphrodisiac beverages, yet it seems to play a significant role in the love lives of many people. Although there is little written about the subject, it should come as no surprise that a beverage that is incorporated into many a daily ritual can leave its mark on a romance – for better or for worse. In honor of Valentine’s Day, we at INeedCoffee believe it is appropriate to tell four coffee-related tales of romance. ### The Last Refuge for the Faint of Heart Not that I’ve been looking or anything, but after reading the Washington D.C. alternative weekly City Paper for several years, I began noticing a frequent pattern in the “I Saw You” section of the City Paper personals. Different from the more conventional permutations of Men/Women Seeking Women/Men one usually finds in the classifieds, the “I Saw You” section is the last refuge for the faint of heart, those who never summoned up the nerve to speak to the attractive stranger who smiled at them on the subway or brushed against them on the dance floor. The man taking out the classic “I Saw You” ad (for, indeed, it usually seems to be a man) describes how he still can’t forget the stranger’s beautiful smile, how he’s been kicking himself ever since for not having the nerve to talk to her and extends an invite to coffee. Until this week, though, I’d never subjected my “I Saw You” stereotype to any amount of scientific scrutiny. Instead, I would like to permit you, the reader to judge for yourself after reviewing these three “I Saw You” ads from a recent City Paper: > Red Line to Farragut North. BW, hoop earrings, brown coat, grey [sic, this is the U.S.] slacks reading about “Development.” Are you a teacher? I’ll teach you about music if you teach me about love. Coffee? > You: Gorgeous, tall, Eastern European girl, maybe Russian. Me: tall Latino in black leather jacket. I was with a friend. Saw you at small gift shop in Dupont Circle. You asked for a price of Matrioshka ($48!). I later saw you at Starbucks. We exchanged glances and a smile. I’d love to meet you for coffee and to discuss the Martioshka and other interesting things. > 1/25, Don Juan carry out, Mt. Pleasant. We exchanged appalled looks and conversation over a rude customer while waiting for take-out. Me: shortish blonde hair, blue eyes, red scarf, kicking myself for not talking more. You: dark hair, reading a book. Coffee at Dos Gringos? A beer at the Raven? What is it about the coffee date that appeals to those seeking a second chance for an icebreaker? Lacking Gallup polling technology and handcuffed by the anonymity of the City Paper ads, we at INeedCoffee are forced to rely upon any common sense available to us. A low-stakes, inexpensive rendezvous at Starbucks seems like the safest bet if you’re trying to convince the attractive stranger to give you a second chance. Playing it cool is no longer an option if major eye contact has moved you to take out a personal ad, but there’s little reason to look even more overanxious. Since you’re already asking the stranger to make the leap of faith that you are something better than a future stalker, a coffeehouse seems like a more attractive atmosphere than a bar, as a caffeine rush is less likely to impair somebody’s judgment than a beer buzz. It should be noted, however, that on the coffee-versus-alcohol dilemma, the above Don Juan customer with a crush on the dark-haired bookworm is willing to hedge his or her bets.![Zoka Latte Art](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/zoka-latte-art1.D6fGfide_VQf6v.webp)_Heart Latte Art_### Starting at Starbucks In contrast to those who lost their nerve, there are those for whom Cupid’s arrow first struck over coffee. Jack and Diane are two who met in Starbucks, and their common interest in coffee not only brought them together, it has been part of the glue that has bound them as a couple for over a year and a half. It began when Jack made an uncharacteristic trip to Starbucks to make a coffee-related purchase. “Normally, I don’t even go to Starbucks, but I was there this one time to buy the ultimate grinder,” says Jack. “If I had not been buying the ultimate grinder, I would never have been there, and we probably would not have ever met. We made eye contact in line, and she came up and started talking, and the rest is history.” The history to which Jack refers consistently involves an appreciation for coffee. While Diane once preferred going out for coffee, Jack roasted his own. It was not long before Diane was sold on the virtues of Jack’s do-it-yourself coffee habits. “She knows home roasting is pretty important to me,” says Jack. “Now, she is a somewhat avid home roaster, and he always has beans at her place. Recently, she has even taken to spreading the ‘gospel’ at her workplace where she sometimes gives her goods to co-workers who enjoy good coffee and can’t get it at work.” A chain coffee shop set the stage for Jack and Diane to meet in a way that almost seems fated, and with their mutual fondness for coffee and home roasting, it is safe to say that coffee is a major component of Jack’s and Diane’s relationship. ### A Relationship’s Growth, Not Stunted by Coffee Cecilia and Alan did not meet at a coffeehouse, but the subject was bound to come up eventually. Alan had a longstanding taste for fine coffee, whereas Cecilia, though fond of coffee in her own right, was more of a tea drinker. As their relationship has developed, Cecilia and Alan have each enhanced the other’s appreciation for their favorite beverages. “As a part of the initial interview process for the position of girlfriend, Alan asked me what type of coffee I liked,” says Cecilia. “I explained that I liked tea better than coffee and that I was a tea snob. Intrigued, he wanted to know more.” They met each other more or less halfway, with Alan becoming increasingly fond of tea as Cecilia elevated her coffee tastes and grew ever more dependent on coffee. “I have grown to need coffee,” says Cecilia. “It was easy for me to move from an appreciation of fine tea to high-quality coffee.” There is plenty of truth to the cliche that a relationship is an investment, and it did not take Cecilia and Alan long to realize that theirs was a romance worth investing in. Worth noting is the coffeehouse atmosphere and multiple espressos that brought their relationship to the next level. As Cecilia tells the story: > “Over the course of two espresso-based drinks at a coffee house, Alan began relaying his goals and dreams to me. He had such enthusiasm that it was exhilarating and endearing. I pulled out a dollar bill and wrote on it “Investing in You” in purple marker. I handed the bill to him and said “I don’t have any money to put in the stock market, but I’ll invest in you today. When your ideas make you rich, it will pay off.” He took the bill and said “Marry me and you can have all of my money.” Flabbergasted, I took another sip of latte and smiled inside. To this day, that dollar bill is in his wallet.” The investment that Alan and Cecilia made in their relationship has had high returns, and they can both feel thankful for the role that coffee has played in its steady growth. ### Bridging the Great Coffee Divide Unlike the couples profiled above, David and Maria do not drink coffee together. Indeed, their situation is just the opposite: David is a coffee junkie and aficionado, while Maria drinks no coffee at all. With coffee such a cherished and necessary part of David’s life and such a non-factor in Maria’s, does this dissimilarity pose an obstacle to their relationship? “If coffee is what keeps him happy, I think we can manage,” says Maria with a laugh. “I have faith we can overcome it.” It’s not as though they haven’t tried to reconcile the gap. But despite an open mind, Maria simply can’t will herself into liking coffee, and it has been a long time since she had a fondness for anything coffee-based. “I used to love coffee ice cream when I was a kid,” says Maria. “I loved the smell of coffee ice cream, but I don’t recall having it since I was about five years old or so. I just don’t like the taste or the smell of coffee now.” David, who drinks four or five large cups of coffee a day, is unlikely to give up coffee anytime soon. Maria takes these habits in stride and makes the occasional concession such as a Dunkin’ Donuts pit stop on a road trip where David can get the requisite large coffee to go. When the two recently traveled to Boston’s heavily Italian North End, Maria found that an after-dinner trip to a cafe could be enjoyable for both coffee-drinker and non-coffee-drinker alike. “I think a cafe can be fun,” Maria says. “I can always get a hot chocolate beverage; I don’t think I’d feel obligated to get coffee.” ### Candy, Flowers… and Coffee? Coffee and Valentine’s Day may make a much better fit than it would first seem. In all sorts of romantic relationships, coffee seems to have either a central or peripheral role to play. Your valentine may not be willing to forsake more traditional Valentine’s Day customs for a cup of coffee, but if the above scenarios are any indication, the coffee probably won’t hurt your cause on V-Day.

# Chicken John: Coffee Achiever [Coffee People](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/coffee-people/)---by [Alex Scofield](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/alex-scofield/)![Chicken John: Coffee Achiever](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/chicken-john-coffee-achiever/Chicken-John-Campaign1.jpg) Chicken John Rinaldi may wind up leaving San Francisco soon. Nearly everybody he knows in town is moving out. To paraphrase Chicken John, the billionaires are kicking the millionaires out, turning the once-eclectic city into an unaffordable, corporate, NIMBY suburb. But Chicken John won’t leave until he’s made his stand. In June, he announced his candidacy for Mayor of San Francisco; he is one of 13 candidates running against incumbent Mayor Gavin Newsom. If Chicken John is fated to leave the town where he has become something of a local legend, he wants San Franciscans to take a good, hard look at his Cafe Racer – a 1975 GMC pickup truck that can run on coffee grounds.![Chicken John Rinaldi ](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/Chicken-John-Campaign1.B0wPv4Zk_Z15uUfj.webp)_Chicken John Rinaldi For Mayor Poster from Scott Beale of [Laughing Squid](https://laughingsquid.com/)_ This may sound sci-fi and incomprehensible, but Chicken John insists on the opposite. The process that fuels the Cafe Racer is not new – it’s called gasification or woodgas, and during World War II, due to petroleum shortages throughout Europe, nearly a million vehicles on the continent were powered by woodgas. What’s more, said Chicken John, woodgas is not a difficult concept to grasp, or even to put into action. “Anyone could do it,” Chicken John said. “You could do it. …This is an unlikely, weird niche thing that I’ve done, and I’m telling you that if you wanted to, you could do this.” Can you make a fire in a garbage can? Can you operate a cigarette? Then, Chicken John says, you could build a gasifier. ### ‘A Beauty Only A Geek Could Appreciate’ In March 2007, a group of 15 “gasification geeks” converted Chicken John’s truck into the Cafe Racer. Using only material that is readily available at most junkyards, the crew installed a gasifier unit on the truck in just over a weekend. “The finished rig is [admittedly] a bit of a carnival of gasification,” said Jim Mason, one of the leaders of the Cafe Racer Crew, on his website on the truck’s conversion. “No attempt was made to have it small, tight, and discrete. On the contrary, the goal was to have all the systems exposed and exploded for easy teaching and [demonstration]. It is likely a beauty that only a gasification geek can appreciate.”![Cafe Racer](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/Cafe-Racer-1.u4O3dhhl_Zlbiel.webp)_Cafe Racer by Scott Beale of [Laughing Squid](https://laughingsquid.com/)_ There are different ways to build and fuel a gasifier, Chicken John said. There’s woodgas, there’s coffee gas, there’s biogas. “You could do it this way or that way. …You don’t have to do it my way; you can come up with your own way,” Chicken John said. “In the end, it’s just the exhaust of a fire.” There is hydrogen in the exhaust of fire – that’s the constant. The density of hydrogen and gasoline in its gaseous state is similar, Chicken John said. Although we put liquid gasoline into the fuel tanks of our cars, what goes into the combustion chamber of a car is gaseous; hydrogen gas can also fuel the engine at this stage. “We’re swapping hydrogen gas for gasoline gas. … The vehicle doesn’t know the difference,” Chicken John said. “You’re actually tricking the vehicle into just running. The vehicle doesn’t know that there’s anything funky going on.” ### Biofuel for the Fire Wood chips can fuel the Cafe Racer, and so can coffee grounds – anything, as long as it has biomass. “The best fuel that we’ve found so far is walnut shells,” Chicken John said. “Those are hard. The harder it is, the better.” Coffee, Chicken John pointed out, is the second-most highly traded commodity on earth – second, of course, to petroleum. So why on earth shouldn’t somebody develop an efficient way to get a vehicle to run on coffee – for that matter, a byproduct of coffee that is otherwise bound for a landfill? At the moment, coffee is probably middle-of-the-road on a practicality scale as a woodgas fuel. About 15 pounds of coffee grounds make up one gallon of gasoline-equivalent (gge), Chicken John said. Getting enough of it wasn’t too tough. Chicken John and some other crew members went to Ritual Coffee Roasters to get the grounds. “We use a shovel, and we spread it out on a big tarp and dry it out. That’s it,” Chicken John said.![Cafe Racer Setup](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/Cafe-Racer-2.KE976FjI_28hCxU.webp)_Cafe Racer Setup by Scott Beale of [Laughing Squid](https://laughingsquid.com/)_ The primary drawback with coffee grounds, said Chicken John, is that they tend to get clumped. While the truck ran fine with coffee in the gasifier, a crew member had to get into the back of the Cafe Racer, stick a shovel into the gasifier and move the grounds around every once in a while, Chicken John said. “If you want the thing to be just turn-the-key, and you want to be able to operate the entire … thing from the driver’s seat without getting in the back of your truck with shovels and gloves and tools and stuff, then yeah, there’s more research and work that has to be done.” In all likelihood, that means converting the coffee grounds into pellet form, a project that will take longer than building the gasifier took. It’s the 80/20 concept, Chicken John said – they’ve gotten 80 percent of the way there easily, and the toughest part will be getting the remaining 20 percent of the way there. The truck already can run on coffee. The challenge now is to make it more practical and convenient than rolling up to a gas station and filling up with fossil fuels at $3 a gallon. “We did 80 percent of the work in the first two hours. Now it’s going to take five years for the other 20 percent of the work to happen,” Chicken John said. “It’s going to take years to make this perfect. …But, I mean, it works today – like right now, today. You put biomass in it, you light it on fire, and you drive away.” ### ‘Pretty Outrageous’ Chicken John knows that many people can’t wrap their minds around the idea of the Cafe Racer, even as the truck makes the rounds. The Cafe Racer crew took it around San Francisco this summer to collect signatures for Chicken John’s mayoral campaign. “This is a pretty outrageous statement to make … that your car can run on garbage instead of gasoline. That’s kind of a lot for people to swallow,” Chicken John said. “They didn’t wake up this morning and expect that they were going to get that information.” That’s what motivated Chicken John to convert his truck in the first place. “When I found out that no one else knew, I knew I had to build it, just to show everybody,” Chicken John said. “This whole oil company thing, it’s a scam. I mean, they’ve got us so well-trained.” Not everybody who sees the Cafe Racer is convinced it’s the real deal. “There’s people that don’t believe it – even when they see the truck running, they have a hard time believing that that truck is running on biofuel,” Chicken John said. People sometimes wonder if there’s a hidden hose pumping in gasoline. For others, the Cafe Racer is a wake-up call, even if it’s only a temporary one. “People are angry,” Chicken John said. “People are like, ‘Huh, you mean all this time, we could have been solving all these problems?” Not only can the truck run on junk, but there are hardly any emissions – “certainly no chain of hydrocarbons that stink,” Chicken John said. “It smells like a campfire, really, or food – it’s hard to put your nose on what it smells like,” Chicken John said. While woodgas has a bit of a cult following, Chicken John doesn’t think that it’s growing much, or that “converts” are coming aboard in any significant numbers. “People are like, ‘Oh, that’s really neat.’ And then they go back home and watch television,” Chicken John said. “No one’s like, ‘Wow, how can I get involved?’ or ‘Wow, here’s 20 bucks.’” ### Conclusion “In life, many things that are unlikely are things that we do indeed do,” Chicken John said. “And one of the unlikely things that I’ve done in my life is that I’ve made my car run on wood.” And coffee, too. It’s a novel thought for most coffee drinkers, that the grounds have potential usefulness even after they’ve been used to brew a beverage. Chicken John is not the inventor of woodgas power, but he’s one of the few Americans to convert his vehicle to operate on it. Just as coffee fuels many human beings, it can fuel a truck as well. That is why, win lose or draw in the San Francisco mayoral race, and wherever he may be living in the years to come, INeedCoffee salutes Chicken John as a coffee achiever. ### Election Results UPDATE: Chicken John earned 1.75% of the popular vote and did not win the Mayoral election.

# Celebrity Coffee Commercials [Coffee History](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/coffee-history/)---by [Sue Zeger](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/sue-zeger/)![Celebrity Coffee Commercials](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/celebrity-coffee-commercials/Celebrity-Coffee-Commercials.jpg) Recently, I was feeling a little nostalgic and trying to remember the jingle from the Chock full o’ Nuts coffee commercial from the 1970s. My mom used to add coffee to my milk when I was a kid because I loved the taste so much. My love affair with coffee still continues today. I love the taste, and in moderation, I love how it makes me feel. Thanks to YouTube, I was able to find the Chock full o’ Nuts “Heavenly Coffee” jingle as well as a bunch of unusual, sexist, and entertaining coffee commercials featuring various celebrities, across several decades, and shot in different countries._[Chock full o’Nuts 23rd St. Store Front Loop Proof](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nraL2Gwtc8A)_ This is a commercial for Instant Maxwell House with Andy Griffith and Ron Howard from the 1960s.

# Chocolate Covered Espresso Almond Biscotti [Recipes](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/coffee-recipes/)---by [Lura Lee](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/lura-lee/)![Chocolate Covered Espresso Almond Biscotti](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/chocolate-covered-espresso-almond-biscotti/dip_biscotti.jpg) The ultimate accompaniment for espresso and cappuccino is biscotti. This dessert is surprisingly easy to make and it can make a wonderful impression on guests or customers.![biscotti](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/biscotti_above1.DP6rx_T8_umDwt.webp) ### Ingredients for the biscotti (Makes approx. 27 biscotti) - 1 cup sugar - 1/2 tsp. baking soda - 1/2 tsp baking powder - 1/8 tsp salt - 2 cups of all-purpose flour - 1 cup sliced almonds - 1 egg + 1 egg yolk - 1 tsp. heavy cream or milk - 1 shot of espresso - 1 tsp. vanilla extract ### Ingredients for the ganache (chocolate dip) - 1 1/2 cups chocolate chips - 1/4 cup heavy cream or milk ### You’ll need - an electric mixer (not a hand mixer) - one large cookie sheet - wax paper - a double boiler (or two pots that will stack safely) ### Step-by-step, with pictures Pull the shot of espresso. Then put the shot in the freezer for a few minutes so that it cools down. Cover a cookie sheet with wax paper. Measure out the almonds and spread them onto the cookie sheet. Try to keep the almonds in one layer. Put the almonds in a 325-degree oven for 10 minutes, or until golden brown. ### Make the dough![Add ingredients to mixer](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/mixer_add_wet.DwLGT196_Z1QlVt1.webp) Put the dry ingredients in the mixing bowl (the flour, sugar, baking soda, baking powder, and salt.) In a separate bowl, mix the wet ingredients (chilled espresso, egg, egg yolk, cream, and vanilla.) Stir the wet ingredients briskly. Slowly add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients while mixing at a low speed.![toasted almonds](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/toasted_amonds.DkoE8N7Q_2q56Uo.webp)![mix in almonds](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/mix_in_almonds.BNhHgXxl_Z2eh9lK.webp) When the almonds are golden brown, take them out of the oven and let them cool for a few minutes. After removing the almonds, readjust the oven temperature to 350F for the biscotti. Add the almonds to the dough, while continuing to mix on a low speed. When the almonds are broken into small pieces and are equally distributed through the dough, turn off the mixer and remove the dough. Knead the dough on a lightly floured surface with lightly floured hands for about 5 turns.![roll into logs](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/roll_into-logs.DDPzFywT_Z1jpWvT.webp) Cut the dough in half, then form it into 2 logs about 10 inches long and about 3 inches thick. ### Baking![logs tray](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/logs_tray.DLOuG7PU_Z19nuYJ.webp) Put new wax paper on the cookie tray. Place the logs onto the cookie tray, three inches apart. Bake the logs for 35 minutes in a 350-degree oven. The logs should have spread and cracked at the top. Remove the biscotti logs from the oven and let them cool for 10 minutes (until you can comfortably handle them.) Meanwhile, lower the oven temperature to 300 degrees.![out of oven](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/out_of_oven.Dr-h9qwQ_2gzWwo.webp)![cut biscotti](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/cut_biscotti.ygeupJMk_AE7Tl.webp) Place the biscotti logs on a cutting surface. Cut the biscotti with a serrated knife. The biscotti should be cut on a diagonal about three inches apart.![biscotti on tray](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/bicotti_on_tray.Bmre3uWb_ZhWi4m.webp) Put new wax paper on the cookie tray. Place the cut biscotti onto the cookie sheet. Bake the biscotti for 5 minutes in a 300-degree oven. Then turn the biscotti and bake the other side for 5 minutes or until it reaches a light, golden-brown color. When they are done baking, take them out of the oven and let them cool for 5 minutes (until you can comfortably handle them.) ### Prepare the Ganache![chocolate melted](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/chocolate_melted.BSbJBNsA_7isLE.webp) While the biscotti are baking for the second round, boil water in the bottom level of the double boiler pot, and bring it to a rolling boil. Add chocolate chips to the top level, then slowly stir in the cream. Stir until the mixture is smooth and thin. Lower the heat and stir occasionally until it is time to use the chocolate. ### Garnish![dip biscotti](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/dip_biscotti.ltAgzEN0_vqTIv.webp)![choc biscotti on tray](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/choc_biscotti_on_tray.CCGzIaBV_Z1i7plY.webp) Dip one side of the biscotti into the chocolate, then place the biscotti on a cooling tray or cookie sheet. ### Conclusion![biscotti and coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/biscotti_n_coffee.5BJYrjeY_yYYfB.webp) Not too bad, right? I told you that it was a relatively simple dessert, now go and enjoy your biscotti with coffee, espresso, or a cappuccino.

# Ceramics and Coffee: The Italian Way! [Coffee History](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/coffee-history/)---by [Myron Joshua](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/myron-joshua/)![Ceramics and Coffee: The Italian Way!](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/ceramics-and-coffee-the-italian-way/c9.jpg)_Only after an Italian puts their hands on a craft could it gain worldwide fame and be considered an art._ We coffee lovers might connect this statement to the art of coffee roasting and making espresso, but, quoted from _virtualitalia.com_ (site down – MAY 2011), it refers to the ceramic style Majolica (maiolica) that flourished in Italy since the Renaissance. We will soon meet Fulvio Taccini, a Majolica artist from the Tuscan town of Vinci, who has created a set of Ceramic urns that expresses the deep connection he feels between his craft and coffee. But first, here is a little background about Majolica. ### Majolica enters Europe through Italy Majolica, like the “arts” of coffee, is not Italian in origin. Like coffee, it was imported from the Eastern world to become highly developed by the Italians. Early examples of this type of ceramic are found in archeological sites of Mesopotamia dating from the ninth or tenth century. During the middle ages, traders brought a later version of this pottery to Italy from the port city of Majorca. So, Italians began referring to this tin-glazed earthenware as Majorca or Majolica. Tuscany was a center of this type of ceramics as the clay-rich riverbeds of the Tiber and the Arno drew artisans to the region. When Moors were expelled from Spain, refugee potters set up small factories in Italy near these river banks. The Italians perfected techniques, developed new glazes and colors, and introduced local themes and designs that literally revolutionized this type of pottery production. From Italy, Majolica spread throughout Europe, giving us such ceramics as Delftware, and Faience-(named after the Italian town of Faenza) This pretty much parallels the path coffee took as it also entered Europe through Italy (via Venice). As Italy developed the arts of roasting and brewing it became known as the cradle of coffee culture. As a family with a long Tuscan tradition, it was natural for the Slitti family, coffee roasters and producers of high-quality chocolates, to turn to Majolica artists Fulvio and Allesandro Taccini with an idea for a project. They wanted to decorate their shop (Slitti Cioccolata e Caffe in the town of Monsummano Terme), with six large Coffee bean dispensers.![Six dispensers](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/c141.D3narpfp_Z1pDrEk.webp)_Six dispensers are topped with portraits of “Coffee Achievers”._ ![ceramic detail](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/c15.mUMmDnzD_Z1geggb.webp)_Detail showing Coffee related images_ These richly painted vases line the wall behind the counter at the Slitti Coffee and Chocolate shop. Beans are dispensed through a hole in the wooden base and, after weighing, extra beans are returned as the dispensing “shovel” fits into a protruding orifice at the bottom of the urn. Fulvio recalls: > When asked to produce the coffee dispensers I suggested that in the ceramic design we integrate the topic of coffee itself. > I knew I would use Raphaelesque decorations as a base. These have been passed down to me by generations of ceramic artists in my family. But I also wanted to tell the story of coffee and its relationship to Slitti and their family craft. The Slittis wanted to commission six traditionally decorated vases, but Fulvio’s drive to go one step further gave birth to the idea of painting a miniature illustrated history of coffee and coffee culture. That initiative put Fulvio on a journey that lasted for two years! Fulvio studied the history of coffee from bean to cup and its journey around the world. Like many other Italians, his love of coffee did not mean he was previously occupied with the historical issues behind the cup. He just had a natural fondness for a well-prepared coffee that used well-prepared beans. (Always appreciating the traditional care taken in preparing coffee in Italy, Fulvio was a little embarrassed by the fact that his family brought an automatic pod espresso machine into the studio. On the other hand, he was quite proud of the pasta he carefully prepared that included tomatoes fondly homegrown) > I started reading the literature and preparing numerous drawings of various coffee machines. I learned about local customs in Ethiopia, about the French love of technological exploration and about the various stages in the evolution of the modern espresso machine in Italy. For the final versions of the vases I finally chose what I thought are the milestones in the story and history of coffee. Between the traditional Raphaelesque motives of “grotesque” dragons, griffins, and flowing vines. He interlaced images depicting different aspects of the coffee myth and history. These include vignettes such as the discovery of the coffee tree by the goats of the Ethiopian shepherd Khaldi, or the opening of Lloyd’s coffee shop in London that later became the famous insurance company.![Kenya Landscape/Coffee server](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/c3.DohneDJB_ZyKJa6.webp) ![La Pavoni 1920](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/c4.Vd4AFM0y_Z1lac23.webp) ![Original and Classic Bialetti Moka Pot](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/c5.y9iZbWyy_2hFee7.webp) ![Glass Vacuum Brewer](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/c6.E-e999aO_Z27fPw5.webp) _(From Left to Right) 1-Kenya Landscape/Coffee server. 2-La Pavoni 1920. 3-Original and Classic Bialetti Moka Pot. 4-Glass Vacuum Brewer._ Besides the historical scenes, many apparatuses used for preparing coffee are pictured: roasters, grinders, and various brewers. The latter, in particular, are rich in variety, portraying historical brewers such as the Vienna Incomparable, the Balance, the original Moka Express, and the first Gaggia pump-driven Espresso machine. Countries important to the cultivation and spread of coffee are represented in miniature landscapes, such as a sunset in Jamaica, a steppe in Kenya, and the minarets of Istanbul. Historically accurate drawings of old-time sea vessels and the “ship of the desert”, the camel, represent the international routes used to move the coffee from lands of origin to your cup. Each vase is capped with a cover adorned with a portrait of a personality who symbolizes that “coffee is a drink that wakes both body and mind” (Fulvio Taccini): ### 6 Ceramic Portraits**Voltaire**: who claimed that his 40 cups a day made it able for him to “stay wide awake-to think, think, and think how to combat the tyrants and imbeciles.”**JS Bach**: who wrote the _Coffee Cantata_.**Beethoven**: who played at the Berk al Pater coffee house (and who used to religiously count 60 beans per cup).**Montesquieu**: represents the democratic aspect of coffee and coffee houses where social classes mix.**Carlo Goldoni**: Italian playwright who wrote a comedy about the _Coffeehouse in Venice_ in 1750.**Napoleon**: frequent coffee house visitor (where he tried his hand at chess).![Goldoni](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/c7.FgvNGC8K_KkDSe.webp) ![Beethoven](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/c8.CQaSXQMC_2apb5k.webp) ![Voltaire](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/c9.CgOPB5rv_qegps.webp) _(From Left to Right) 1-Goldoni. 2-Beethoven. 3-Voltaire_ The six large vases, each one meter high and 40 cm in diameter, have a stately look sitting on the wall in the coffee shop. While the surface is full of what could have been incongruous materials, I found myself drawn into the detailed tapestry finding image after image. They were more impressive and coherent when viewed in person than when I had previously seen them in photos at the studio. ### Fulvio’s Tells His Story > On our father’s side, work in ceramic art goes back to the 18th century. But the tradition goes back even farther in my mother’s family. > Just like coffee, in the field of ceramics, every region in Italy develops its own distinctive style. We Italians remain faithful to our soil, the air, sun and atmosphere of our region. We let these aspects penetrate our daily life and style. You know, each area in Italy prefers different roasts in their coffee and different hues in their ceramics. > Our family unites all aspects of ceramic work. When we take on a project we cover all phases, working together organically,-combining design, modeling and painting. We are dedicated to detailed and conscientious work. This type of attitude is what has made the crafts of ceramic and coffee develop to such heights in Italy. > The love of coffee, like the love of everything in life, is in the details, in grasping the unique ingredients and personal commitment that goes into the human endeavor. The common denominator is commitment to tradition and the will to continually improve, at times to innovate.![Traditional design with Coffee branch](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/c10.DiB16Z7T_1wMVOo.webp) ![Fulvio Taccini painting](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/c11.B4QoCG-R_Z20CLNx.webp) ![Kahve](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/c12.CMCgyfTZ_2ejV1p.webp) _(From Left to Right) 1-Traditional design with Coffee branch. 2-Fulvio Taccini painting a vase. 3-The term “Kahve” connects coffee and wine._> In our studio, we have learnt the antique techniques of producing ceramics from my late father, Orlando. From there we have gone forth studying new solutions for new works. Every day is new-but every day grows from our history, culture and environment. The air, the water, the oil, wine and country-side makes Tuscany and us, the inhabitants of Tuscany unique. Just like coffee, in our field there has been a slow evolution; constant change and growth as new people confronted the same raw material. In the area of coffee roasting techniques and brewing methods were perfected. At times new methods were invented. In the area of ceramic new designs get added to old, colors and glazing techniques progress on the basis of the old traditions. > In short, coffee fascinates me: Its history, its aromas and the innumerable ways it can be prepared. A good cup of coffee, like a good ceramic, depends on many factors: good raw material, the quality of water, the method of preparation, the care of the artist and your mood at the time you confront the product. > I took pleasure as Mr. Slitti became actively involved in the work. He was no longer merely a patron paying for a ceramic piece. He became a partner as we learned together and spoke about our crafts. I consider this work to be extremely personal and a milestone for me but it has also become Slitti’s work as he joined me in the creation. You see, like coffee, ceramics can bring people together. This article is dedicated to the memory of Orlando Taccini, patriarch of the Taccini Brothers, Alessandro Vittorio, and Fulvio, who passed away on March 5, 2003. One can get a sense of the man and his character when meeting his progeny.![Orlando Taccini ](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/c13.Dkn9yXDP_25nKgH.webp)_Orlando Taccini (1914-2003)_###  Resources Slitti Cioccolata e Caffe Published on January 25, 2004--- #### Myron Joshua Myron Joshua grew up on Chocolate Milk with the gurgling of his mother’s Folgers being percolated in the background. At age 18 while living on a Kibbutz in Israel he learned to drink “cafe botz” (Cooked turkish coffee) in the communal dining hall before going to the fields at 5:30 am. From then it was 30 years of instant coffee (no sugar, no milk) until someone poured him a cup of brewed Sumatran. Now he grinds his own beans before going to work at his office in Kibbutz Kfar Etzion.

# CBTL Kaldi Single Cup Coffee Brewer Review [Brewing Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/brewing-coffee/)---by [Chris Arnold](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/chris-arnold/)![CBTL Kaldi Single Cup Coffee Brewer Review](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/cbtl-kaldi-single-cup-coffee-brewer-review/kaldi-espresso-brewer.jpg)_**UPDATE September 2020:** The CBTL Kaldi Single Cup Brewer is no longer available for purchase._ Coffeemaker manufacturers more and more are promising a quicker, easier, and more delicious “Personalized Hot Beverage”. You have likely heard of Keurig or Tassimo. Maybe even Nespresso. Well, make room for another one. The Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf has decided to join the game with its own proprietary capsule system. They don’t have any marketing name for it, but the capsules are made for them by _Caffitaly_. It looks very much like a cross between a Keurig K-Cup and a Nespresso Capsule. The retail price is $179.99 USD. They offer not only coffee and tea but also espresso as part of their system. The unit we are looking at is called the Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf Kaldi. Here is their marketing blurb about what they claim sets their capsule system apart from the rest. > Each capsule contains The Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf hand-selected premium coffees and hand-plucked whole leaf teas grown on the world’s best coffee and tea estates. To lock in these delicate aroma and flavor characteristics, every serving of espresso, coffee and tea is freshness-sealed. And each espresso capsule, coffee capsule and tea capsule features an internal two-filter system to ensure evenly balanced extraction and optimal flavor. I like Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf coffee and espresso. I hope their claims are true. Let’s find out. ### What’s In the Box? The kit I received included the CBTL Kaldi machine, a sampler pack of espresso, coffee & tea, as well as a few printed materials.![cbtl-kaldi](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/cbtl-kaldi.zaQhBeHd_Prb9r.webp)_CBTL Kaldi and Sampler Pack_### Instructional Material The printed material is clear, concise, and does not overwhelm. The main user manual has several nice illustrations and is about 20 pages. I was able to get up and running pretty quickly just by reading the Quick Reference Guide (only 2 pages). Good job. I did have a problem with the initial priming procedure, and the printed troubleshooting info did not provide a solution. However, a call to tech support got it solved within a few minutes.![kaldi-manuals](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/kaldi-manuals.ppqhFruX_Z1I6ewF.webp) ### Looks and Build Quality The machine has a small footprint, which is nice. Though mostly plastic, it has a fairly solid feel. Mine was sort of candy apple red, and might be considered stylish by some. They are available in other colors besides red. If the machine were to be made with fewer curves and rounded parts, they could have expanded things like the small water container, small drip tray, and small spent capsule tray without increasing the footprint much.![cbtl-coffee-brewer](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/cbtl-coffee-brewer.wKK15Tcx_Zq30ln.webp) ### User Interface / User Experience (UI/UX) The machine has a big, heavy feeling lever that you use to engage and disengage the pods, depending on whether you pull or push it. It also serves as part of the factory reset function. Once the Lever is opened, there is a capsule-shaped opening at the top of the machine. The capsule goes in “sideways”, so it takes some getting used to, but seems to work well enough.![cbtl-top](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/cbtl-top.UcGvY2r6_26I2uG.webp) There is a small drip tray that is removable. That is attached to a larger tray that fits into the body of the machine, which is used to capture spent capsules. Both are very small, and you will need to empty them often. Somehow, the way the two fit together is not only weird but also messy. A bad design that also seems to spill water outside of the tray, inside of the machine, and ultimately onto your counter. They clearly never used this themselves. This is a design disaster.![cbtl-parts](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/cbtl-parts.Ctp2TI1T_226VYD.webp) There are three main backlit buttons on the front, each with a different size cup; they call them “Espresso”, “Long Espresso & Tea Latte”, and “Brewed Coffee/Tea”. There is one light on either side, one orange and one red, as well as an audible beeper. The combination of backlit buttons, lights, and sounds will do different things depending on the situation. There is no way to memorize it all; you need to refer to the manual. I am a fan of single LEDs that have different colors (like red, orange, and blue) for different functions or feedback. CBTL chose poorly.![kaldi-espresso-brewer](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/kaldi-espresso-brewer.D_jabw3B_4ketm.webp) ### Espresso Quality I tried all of the included espresso samplers. The crema was thin to non-existent. The flavor was bitter in some cases and flat in others. It tasted like the coffee was ground too coarse, was too old, or both. ### Coffee Quality I tried all of the included brewed coffee samplers. The flavor was mostly flat. Below par against a typical Keurig K-Cup machine. Again, tasted like there wasn’t enough coffee, was too old, or both.![coffee-kaldi-cbtl](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/coffee-kaldi-cbtl.BRckYYPi_2doFM0.webp) ### Tea Quality I tried all 4 of the included tea samplers. The flavor was not bad. I am not a huge tea drinker, but I would say it is a step above a teabag and a step below loose-leaf tea. ### Other The machine has a pre-infusion cycle for espresso, and while this is a great idea, the reality is that when doing one cup after another, sometimes spits some regular water into your cup first, which is not good. I was also disappointed when I did one cup of coffee, followed by a cup of tea, and the tea got a bunch of leftover coffee grounds in the cup. It seems you need to purge it a few times to clear out the old grounds. Also, the tea itself puts a **lot** of particulate matter of its own into the cup. See Photo.![tea](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/tea.DQsJQklh_o5Pho.webp) The water container is about 32 ounces (about 1 liter) if filled to the “Max” line. Though this seems like a lot, it really isn’t in practice, and you will find yourself refilling often. Luckily, the water container can be removed or filled in place. You can customize the amount of water that comes out for each of the buttons, and easily reset them to defaults. Although the paperwork doesn’t specifically mention it, you can use any of the buttons as an ad-hoc Hot Water function.![kaldi-coffee-brewer](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/kaldi-coffee-brewer.CfiigswD_Z1daY2X.webp) ### Pros - Coffee, Tea, and Espresso are all available in a single machine. - Tea is a step up from tea bags. - The power power-saving feature is nice and can be disabled/enabled easily. - The descale feature with a reminder is nice and keeps your machine running longer. - The cup holder can be adjusted for different cup sizes by turning it over. ### Cons - The espresso is underwhelming. - Coffee is underwhelming. - You must buy proprietary, harder-to-find capsules. Though the price per serving is on par with other systems at about $0.75 per serving, others like Keurig K-Cups can be found anywhere (like your local Costco). Also, variety is limited vs. other systems. K-Cups have dozens and dozens of manufacturers and variations. - The water tank is not dishwasher safe. - No Hot Chocolate capsules are offered. - The drip tray and Capsule tray are a design disaster and make a mess. ### Conclusion I was excited at the promise of a new coffee system, especially with the mention of espresso (which some other systems do not have). As an espresso fan, I was also excited to read the marketing material, setting them apart by promising the same experience as your local Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf. Unfortunately, the espresso and coffee are underwhelming at best. If you want no-fuss, decent espresso, get a Nespresso. It is the closest thing to real espresso in a single-serve machine. If you want brewed coffee, go with a Keurig. The machines are cheaper, and the quality is just as good, if not better. If you want a quick way to make tea that is a step up from tea bags, the Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf Kaldi is the machine for you. ### Resources_CBTL Kaldi S04 Single Cup Brewer (no longer available)_ Published on June 18, 2014--- #### Chris Arnold Chris is the creator of Two Bit History.

# Chemex Coffee Brewing – History and Tutorial [Brewing Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/brewing-coffee/)---by [Michael Allen Smith](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/michael-allen-smith/)![Chemex Coffee Brewing – History and Tutorial](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/chemex-coffee-brewing-history-and-tutorial/Chemex-Coffee-Brewing-Tutorial-1.jpg) The first time I saw a Chemex was in December 2002. It wasn’t in a coffee shop but in an art museum. The Chemex was part of the _Vital Forms_ exhibit at the San Diego Museum of Art. The gallery focused on American Art during the Atomic Age of 1940 through 1960. After the art exhibition, I ordered one and began brewing with it. It has been more than a decade since that visit. Since the early 2000s, the Chemex has had a resurgence in popularity. You can find the Chemex in many coffee shops. While some use it for decoration, an increasing number are using it as part of their slow brew bar. This is where the customer gets a handmade brewed coffee, much like they already get for espresso-based drinks. The Chemex brews coffee using the infusion method, which makes it most similar to drip coffee in terms of body and taste. Chemex filters are 20-30% thicker than those used by other pourover methods, such as the [Hario](https://ineedcoffee.com/how-hard-is-a-hario-pour-over/). The result is a slower brew and a richer cup of coffee. Although not as rich as the French Press, the Chemex does produce a sediment-free cup of coffee that will impress anyone used to the weaker taste of most auto-drip coffee machines.![chemex coffee brewer setup with scale and filters](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/chemex650.C4OKaxn8_EV4Kn.webp) ### Chemex History American chemist Peter Schlumbohm (1896-1962) invented the Chemex brewer, and the Chemex Corporation released it in 1942. This was when 64% of all household coffee was made using a percolator. Mark Pendergrast, in the book Uncommon Grounds, writes about the popularity of Chemex, saying: > It never challenged the percolator, except among highbrows and purists. International Housewares of Pittsfield, MA, manufactures the Chemex brewer and its accessories. ### Grinding and Dosage For dosage, Chemex advises: > Using Regular or Automatic Grind coffee only, put one rounded tablespoon of coffee per 5 oz. cup into the filter cone A regular grind is a bit more coarse than a drip grind. Some online tutorials say to use drip fineness, whereas others say to use French press coarseness. A good starting point is to be in between those points. If the coffee brews too fast and tastes weak, you could grind it a little finer. On the flip side, if the coffee gets “clogged,” coarsen up the grind. A digital scale will help with dosage consistency. Using a 17 to 1 brewing ratio (17 parts water to one part coffee), a Chemex will have 510 grams of water for every 30 grams of ground coffee. For math, use 500 grams of water. Once you know you have the correct amount of coffee and water, you can focus on perfecting your grind. ### Step by Step Chemex Brewing_For this tutorial, we will be brewing 18 ounces of coffee. To brew more, use multiplication._### #1 Heat Water You will need the 510 grams of water used for the brew and some extra water to rinse the filter.![hot water kettle for chemex coffee ](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/chcmex-heat-water.Bx5d3n1n_1UlKTQ.webp) ### #2 Grind Coffee Grind 30 grams of coffee. What grind is best? Start with something a little coarser than drip but finer than a French press. See our [Coffee Grind Chart](https://ineedcoffee.com/coffee-grind-chart/) for visual guidance.![weight coffee in grams on scale ](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/chemex-weigh-beans.B2WycF4O_1VJWWJ.webp) ### #3 Insert Filter Place the square filter inside the Chemex. The side with the three sections should be just over the Chemex lip used for pouring.![chemex coffee filter fold ](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/chemex-filter-sections.DII6M82o_rL0cl.webp) Once the water is warm, rinse the filter and discard the water from the rinse. This also serves to pre-heat the carafe.![rinse chemex coffee filter with hot water](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/chemex-rinse-filter.RjEwFHzS_Z21CiT3.webp) ### #4 Add Coffee Place the ground coffee inside the filter.![add ground coffee inside chemex coffee fitler](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/chemex-add-coffee.D7FoDMHS_Zo5vMM.webp) ### #5 Pour Water Once the water reaches a boil, remove it from the heat source and let it cool for 20-30 seconds before pouring. The initial pour is very important. Instead of pouring all the water onto the grounds as you would with a press pot, only pour enough water to saturate the beans. Chemex states that wetting the grounds allows them to _bloom_. This step is essential to get all the coffee in contact with water. After you wet the grounds, wait 20-40 seconds. During this time trapped carbon dioxide (CO2) escapes from the grounds.![let hot water saturate chemex coffee ](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/chemex-saturation-431x650.BdWe8hRj_jk6hk.webp) ### #6 Stir (optional) At this point, you can stir the coffee with a wooden spoon.![optional chemex coffee stir with wooden spoon](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/chemex-stir.BfmAo6du_1946yo.webp) ### #7 Add the Rest of the Water Continue adding water gradually. Do not fill it to the very top. Always allow at least an inch of room at the top. Stop pouring the water when you’ve reached your desired amount of coffee. Using a digital scale will prevent you from using too much water.![chemex coffee brewing - near finished](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/chcmex-near-finished.B6EVvWRl_2x5lvP.webp) ### #8 Serve Once the water has passed through the filter, remove the filter and serve.![pour chemex coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/chemex-pour.B8KHheGv_1ptiiG.webp) ### Post Brew Like other manual coffee brewing methods, you must keep any extra coffee warm. Besides chugging the remaining coffee quickly, two ideas come to mind. The first is to transfer any extra coffee to a thermal carafe. The other is to get in the habit of brewing only the amount of coffee you plan to drink. The original version of this article suggested using the wire grid sold by Chemex to place over your stovetop. This probably is not a good idea, as heating coffee post-brew can harm the flavor. Plus, it is not necessary to dedicate a hot burner to keeping coffee warm when an insulated carafe works just fine without affecting the flavor. ### Reusable Filters In addition to the popular paper filters, you can now purchase reusable filters for the Chemex. The Able Brewing Kone Coffee Filter is a stainless steel insert that you rinse between brews. Some people have a strong preference for paper versus metal filters. I like them both equally. The cleanup is more manageable with paper filters, but with reusable filters, you’ll never wake up to discover you are out of filters. While putting this article together, I saw that Amazon is also selling a CoffeeSock, a reusable cotton filter for the Chemex. If you don’t mind the clean-up, this might be worth checking out. ### Cleaning In the book _Uncommon Grounds_, author Mark Pendergrast stated the Chemex was _difficult to clean_. I beg to differ. It’s a piece of glass. Rinse it out with hot, soapy water. Even just hot water without the soap is enough to keep it clean. And if, for some reason, you need extra cleaning, the glass carafe is dishwasher safe. Just be sure to remove the handle. Untie the leather knot, and the handle will fall right off. Another option for cleaning is to fill the Chemex with ice and add salt. Add some ice and a tablespoon of salt, and spin it. Dump, rinse and you are ready to go for the next brew. Thanks to [Jesse of Conduit Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/meet-the-roaster-interview-with-jesse-nelson-of-conduit-coffee/) for that idea. ### Last Words So, does the Chemex make good coffee? Absolutely. Many people’s favorite pour-over coffee brewing method is the Chemex, which can be used with an electric kettle and a digital scale. There are four Chemex models: 3-cup, 6-cup, 8-cup, and 10-cup. The 3-cup one uses a different-sized filter and cannot use the Able Kone. ### Resources [Chemex Coffee History](https://chemexcoffeemaker.com/pages/about-us) – More on the history of the Chemex from the corporate site._This article was first written in January 2003.

# Chinese Coffee [Coffee History](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/coffee-history/)---by [Chris Arnold](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/chris-arnold/)![Chinese Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/chinese-coffee/chinacoffeemap1.jpg) While everyone has heard of Chinese tea, Chinese Coffee somehow just sounds wrong; unless it is an Al Pacino movie. And while China is famous for tea, they are becoming known in the coffee world too, both in the retail coffee shop world and the wholesale green coffee arena. Coffee was actually brought to China in the late 1800s by Jesuits. In the 1930s, there was a coffee boom, when places like Shanghai were popular destination spots with the so-called Western Adventurer. At that time, though, many of the cafes were run by Westerners. There was a bust for a few decades afterward, but there is another boom on the rise which really started as far back as the late 1980s. And this time, many of the coffee serving establishments are owned or run by the Chinese, and there are now plantations that produce green coffee for domestic and export, and that continues to grow in area and output every year. Coffee drinking in China is still associated with the West and is seen as more of a fashion statement and a luxury than something you prepare at home on your way to work. But consumption, in general, is on the rise, and the numbers do bear this out. It should be noted, however, that much of the coffee consumption in China is currently in the form of instant coffee. Since coffee is still fairly new, the Chinese are going to need time to appreciate freshly roasted coffee. And since instant coffee is relatively cheap and easy to find, those are just more reasons for its popularity. And don’t forget that tea is very cheap, is the national drink, and has been around for thousands of years; so coffee has a lot of competition in China.![starbucks in China](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/starbucks-in-china.q9OmkVVM_ZNnCGl.webp)_[Starbucks in China](https://www.flickr.com/photos/50695024@N00/263998722/) by Kagemori._ With regards to retail coffee, Starbucks had over 100 outlets in China in 2004 but now has over 400 locations, so the trend toward freshly roasted and brewed coffee is expected to continue its upward rise, even if instant coffee is still relegated to being prepared at home, complete with its 3-in-1 mix of freeze-dried coffee, sugar, and cream. But even Starbucks needs to worry, as local competition (and outright copycats) have sprung up as direct competition. In fact, one local Chinese coffee chain used Chinese characters which were almost the same as Starbucks. Starbucks sued. Sounds like coffee has many good years of growth ahead of it in China. In 1988, the Chinese government and the United Nations Development Program started a project to produce coffee in the Yunnan province. Along with Nestle, the coffee growing area grew and grew. The Yunnan province has a climate and condition similar to that of Indonesia and parts of South America, so in theory, the quality coming out of this area should be quite high. But they have had to fight things like quality control, and the “Dry Leaf” coffee virus. The efforts seemed to have worked, as coffee coming out of the premier Simao region is quite good considering how little time it has been. And it should get better as time goes on, as the government is now behind the effort, and the Ruili, Baoshan, and Kunming regions are also producing Arabica coffee beans. On a side note, unlike much of the Vietnamese Robusta coffee, a large amount of Arabica coffee comes out of China. They do grow Robusta, but mainly on Hainan island and in the Fujian province, but it only represents about 20 percent of the total grown in the country.![china coffee map](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/chinacoffeemap1.Dycaz0YH_ZR2hkH.webp)_China Map_ So what do the numbers look like? The total volume of coffee sales grew in China by upwards of 90% from 1997 to 2003, and the numbers have continued to rise similarly to the present. Low green coffee prices around the world, resulted in lower retail coffee prices in China. This raised awareness about coffee and, in turn, caused more investment interest in both local green coffee growing operations and retail coffee shops and internet cafes. Couple that with admiration for anything considered Western (and therefore hip), and you can see why coffee is taking off. Could China, in the future, be the next Colombia in the 1970s? A Chinese version of Juan Valdez? Who knows. But the fact that even small-time home roasters are getting their hands on green Chinese coffee (and enjoying it), tells us that China is capable of producing a decent clean-tasting Arabica coffee bean, and the volume is there. If they keep it up, in a few years, we may see Chinese coffee viewed in the same light as Kona Coffee, Jamaican Blue Mountain, and maybe even Kopi Luwak. ### Resources [Colombian Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/colombian-coffee/) – History and overview.

# Chocolate Covered Espresso Beans [Recipes](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/coffee-recipes/)---by [Stefanie Spencer](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/stefanie-spencer/)![Chocolate Covered Espresso Beans](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/chocolate-covered-espresso-beans/chocolate-covered-espresso-beans1.jpg) What would be the perfect coffee confection to give to your valentine? Chocolate-covered coffee beans of course. Delectable chocolate on the outside and a crunchy, caffeine-filled, exquisite coffee bean on the inside. Mmmmm. They’re also great for those long road trips, providing some quick energy along the way. What is better than buying a gift for your Valentine? Making something special just for him or her. Here is a quick and easy way to make your own chocolate-covered coffee beans at home. First, you must choose some freshly roasted coffee beans. A medium to dark roast is great, but a light roast would be too acidic. Then you must choose your chocolate. I am a huge fan of dark chocolate, especially Ghirardelli, but semi-sweet, milk, or even white chocolate would be tasty. You can use chocolate chips, squares, or special dipping chocolate. You might also want to have on hand some powdered sugar or cocoa powder for decoration.![chocolate covered espresso beans](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/chocolate-covered-espresso-beans1.BLJrpQE9_Z1wgK31.webp)_[Photo](http://www.flickr.com/photos/shereen84/2487154213/in/photostream/) by Shereen M_### Ingredients - 1/2 cup of chocolate chips - 1/3 cup of roasted coffee beans ### Directions #### Step #1 – Melt Chocolate Melt 1/2 cup chocolate chips in a double boiler over low heat to keep from burning the chocolate. You can also melt it in the microwave, but remember to stir it every 15-30 seconds. #### Step #2 – Cool and Mix After it is smooth, turn off the heat and let it cool for a minute, then mix in about 1/3 cup of the roasted coffee beans and stir. #### Step #3 – Spread the Coffee Beans With a spoon or fork, lay the coffee beans out on some wax paper on a tray, making sure they are all separated from each other. #### Step #4 – Chill Let them cool there, or put them in the freezer to speed things up. If you would like more chocolate on them, or just for looks, drizzle some white or other chocolate over them. Let them cool completely. #### Step #5 – Finishing Moves Separate them into a bowl or bag, and then dust them with powdered sugar or cocoa powder if you chose. ### Last Words Chocolate-covered coffee beans are a quick way to melt your valentine’s heart. Find a cute heart-shaped tin or some lovely red ribbon to tie up a bag and you are well on your way to the perfect gift. Whip up a batch and indulge yourself. ### Resources [How to Make Chocolate Covered Coffee Beans](https://ineedcoffee.com/how-to-make-chocolate-covered-coffee-beans/) – This recipe uses 3 different types of chocolate.

# Chocolate Espresso Cookies and Viennese Coffee [Recipes](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/coffee-recipes/)---by [Wen Zientek-Sico](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/wen-zientek-sico/)![Chocolate Espresso Cookies and Viennese Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/chocolate-espresso-cookies-and-viennese-coffee/cookies_250x2501.jpg) Deep dense chocolate and coffee combined in a rich cookie. What could possibly be better? My coffee-loving recipes testers could not decide which were better – the cookies with the smoother flavor of the crushed beans or the ones with the more assertive coarsely chopped beans. So try both versions! Any type of chocolate – milk, bittersweet, German, white, semisweet…can be used to glaze these cookies with great results. These cookies store very well and are also very sturdy – making them great for gift giving or taking to parties or the office.![Chocolate Espresso Cookies](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/cookies_250x2501.B5BPZQmX_ZPm9D0.webp)_Chocolate Espresso Cookies_### Ingredients - 1/2 cup butter - 4 ounces unsweetened chocolate - 1/2 cup crushed or chopped chocolate-covered espresso beans, divided - 4 eggs - 2 cups sugar - 2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract - 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour - 1/2 cup cocoa powder (measured, then stirred or sifted) - 2 teaspoons baking powder - 1/2 teaspoon salt - 1 cup bittersweet chocolate (or favorite chocolate) ### Directions Melt the butter and unsweetened chocolate in a small heavy saucepan over low heat. Add two tablespoons of the espresso beans and mix until smooth. Cool to room temperature. In a large bowl beat the eggs, sugar, and vanilla until thick and lemon-colored, about five minutes. Mix in the chocolate mixture. Sift in the flour, cocoa, baking powder, and salt and mix until just barely incorporated. Do not overmix. Chill the dough for 1-2 hours. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Line heavy baking sheets with aluminum foil (shiny side up) or parchment paper. Using slightly wet hands, roll the cookies into golf ball sized balls and place 2 inches apart on the prepared cookie sheet. Bake for 10-12 minutes, or until the cookies are firm on the edges. They should still be soft and brownie-like in the center. Cool the cookies on the sheet for five minutes, and then remove to a cooling rack to finish cooling. Melt the bittersweet chocolate until smooth. Glaze each cookie with the melted chocolate and sprinkle with the remaining espresso beans. Let dry thoroughly before storing in an airtight container. Makes about 3 dozen cookies.

# Clever Coffee Dripper Review [Brewing Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/brewing-coffee/)---by [Chris Arnold](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/chris-arnold/)![Clever Coffee Dripper Review](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/clever-coffee-dripper-review/Clever-Coffee-Dripper.jpg) The Clever Coffee Dripper has gotten a lot of buzz. The claim is that it offers the best of Drip and [French Press](https://ineedcoffee.com/press-pot-tutorial/), without the drawbacks of either.![Clever Coffee Dripper - Add Filter](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/ccd-11.5svrDZVA_Z1A3uMb.webp)_Clever Coffee Dripper – Insert Coffee Filter_ At its core, it is very similar to a manual Melitta Cone Filter Coffeemaker, with a few nice additions: - A valve that opens when placed on a cup or thermos and closes when you take it off. - The ability to control the steeping time (unlike a Melitta-style, where liquid begins immediately to flow). - A lid is used to keep some heat during steeping. - A little coaster to set the dripper onto.![Clever Coffee - Add Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/ccd-2.wY5P0-OJ_ZX95JN.webp)_Clever Coffee Dripper – Add Coffee_### Body I love the flavor that I can produce with the Clever Coffee Dripper. I am not a huge French Press fan (mainly because I get indigestion and the jitters), but I do like coffee that has a decent body and a higher particulate-to-water ratio than most drip machines with paper filters produce. Some people use a SwissGold Filter or Gold Filter to attain this, but I find it is too close to French Press for me, and I think part of the problem is that there are too many oils. The Clever Coffee Dripper is perfect for this. The Clever Coffee Dripper is perfect in this regard and doesn’t let too many oils in the cup, probably due to absorption by the paper filter. You could probably make it closer to French Press by using a SwissGold or Frieling Cone Filter, but I did not try that.![Clever Coffee - Add Hot Water](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/ccd-3.CAglFU5v_Z7XL6x.webp)_Pour hot water over the grounds._ I found that all my favorite cups were too wide, and my favorite thermoses were too narrow to sit correctly or activate the valve. I would like to see a design where the width of the vessel doesn’t really matter, and the valve is controlled by a button or something. I know this might complicate the design/manufacture or increase cost, but I would be willing to pay another $10 for this.![Clever Coffee - Cover Coffee Grinds](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/ccd-4.Dt4F4nq0_ZF1Lus.webp)_Cover grounds with hot water_ I used the Clever Coffee Dripper using many of the variations that Tom from Sweet Maria’s mentions on his site just to see what I liked. It turned out I am somewhat lazy, and I was fine with my method below since it seems a lot easier for me, so here it is: 1. Grind a little on the finer side, probably medium-fine grind as shown on the [Coffee Grind Chart](https://ineedcoffee.com/coffee-grind-chart/). 2. I don’t weigh my coffee or water. 3. On a #4 filter, I just eyeball and fill the coffee until it is filled about 1/3 of the way from the bottom. 4. I immediately pour the water and stir, leave about an inch of headroom for bloom, and put the cover on. 5. I rarely stir in between, and usually, at around 3 minutes, I let it all go into the cup.![Clever Coffee - Optional Stir](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/ccd-6.B4_1ZeDF_18TOXK.webp)_An optional stir during the Clever brew._![Clever Coffee - Add Lid](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/ccd-5.BAftl7kc_Z1KGeDf.webp)_Add the lid to Clever during the brew._![Clever Coffee Finished](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/ccd-9.6khq0z62_2jwKuA.webp)_Clever Coffee – Finished Brewing!_### Conclusion Although it doesn’t fit all my vessels, at $20, it is a great deal. I would recommend you go and buy one right now. You will probably find that you reach for this over your French Press, Melitta, or Drip Machine; I know I do.**Pros**- The price is reasonable at about $20. - Controlling steeping time is very nice. - Takes either a #4 or #6 cone filter. - Great videos and written documentation on how to use the Clever Coffee Dripper.![Clever Coffee brewing](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/ccd-7.KcQazMbI_1GzcPo.webp)_Clever Coffee Brewing_**Cons**- The design does not fit most of my coffee cups (the cups are too wide). - The design does not fit most of my thermoses (the thermos is too narrow). - No insulation, which results in coffee being a little cooler than I would like, especially with longer steeping times. - The dripper and Coaster slide around too much because of the slick plastic. Some anti-slip material would be a nice addition.![Clever Coffee - Size of Mugs](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/ccd-8.DXsnexRh_Z19Pjh7.webp)_Mugs that don’t work for the Clever._### Resources [Step By Step Bonavita Immersion Coffee Dripper Tutorial](https://ineedcoffee.com/step-step-bonavita-immersion-coffee-dripper-tutorial/) – A similar brewing method that uses a ceramic brewer instead of plastic.

# Choosing My Coffee Maker [Brewing Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/brewing-coffee/)---by [Malcolm Pang](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/malcolm-pang/)![Choosing My Coffee Maker](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/choosing-my-coffee-maker/vac-pot-and-chemex1.jpg) This coffee brewer guide is meant to assist buyers to choose the ideal single cup coffee brewer for individual use. All coffee brewers are capable of making good coffee but not all of them are designed for single cup brewing. There are several brewing methods since the discovery of coffee, and the method chosen is a matter of personal preference, based on the: - Taste and quality of coffee produced using the method - Ease of use - Ease of cleaning and maintenance - Price of the equipment - Esthetic value For now, the most popular method of making coffee is the drip method, where water is poured over the coffee grounds in a filter above the carafe. This method offers convenience, the ability to make many cups at the same time and keep them warm if the carafe comes with a hot plate or warmer. Next in popularity is the [French press](https://ineedcoffee.com/troubleshooting-french-press-coffee/), where hot water poured over coffee grounds is set to steep for 3 to 5 minutes before the filter is pressed down to separate the grounds from the coffee, depending on the preferred strength of the coffee brewed. As this method uses meshed metal filter instead of a paper filter used in the drip method, it is able to keep the essential oils in the brew, making one of the strongest coffee among the brewing methods, especially when the steeping time is long. Note that most drip brewers today come with a plastic filter to do away with the paper type. The [vacuum pot](https://ineedcoffee.com/vacuum-pot-brewing/) method of making coffee carries the most esthetic values, attributed to the beautiful design of the brewer and the brewing process which is both entertaining and fascinating. The brewer is made up of two glass “bulbs” placed on top of each other with a rubber seal and filter in the connection. Water is filled in the lower bulb while the coffee grounds are poured into the upper bulb. The setup is then placed over a heat source where heated water will flow upwards to mix with the grounds in the upper bulb until a vacuum is created in the lower bulb. During this time, the mixture will be stirred to maximize the extraction. When the heat source is removed, the vacuum will suck the brewed coffee down into the lower bulk, thus ending the brew. Coffee brewed using this method is usually rich and clean of sediments as compared to the French press method. This is the most commonly used method in cafes and restaurants.![Vac-Pot and Chemex](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/vac-pot-and-chemex1.qvXK-2HN_Z1TsXPK.webp)_Vac-Pot and Chemex_ The [stove-top Moka brewer](https://ineedcoffee.com/moka-pot-stove/) works similar to the vacuum method except that the coffee grounds are packed in a filter compartment in between the top and bottom metal chambers whereby heated water will force through the grounds via steam pressure for extraction. The brewed coffee will reach the top chamber and pour out through the spout on top. This method is commonly used to make the traditional espresso since extraction is achieved through steam pressure.![Stovetop Espresso Maker](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/add-heat-espresso-maker.Caxgm5Ma_1Cb6cW.webp)_Stovetop Espresso Maker_ The Neapolitan flip-drip brewer is quite similar to the Moka method but stops short when the water is boiled. Instead of relying on steam pressure to force extraction, the brewer is flipped upside down and hot water will drip through the coffee grounds and the final coffee is collected in the bottom chamber. The pour-over method is one of the simplest methods of making coffee. Hot water is poured directly over coffee grounds in a filter slowly to maximize extraction. Though simple, it requires skill in order to make a good cup of coffee. The last method of brewing, the cold-water method, defies the normal procedure whereby cold water is slowly dripped into a large number of coffee grounds such that the resulting brew takes around 8 to 12 hours to extract. The strength of the brew depends on the dripping rate, grind size of the grounds, and the ground amount to control the rate of the water flowing through the grounds. The [cold water coffee brewer](https://ineedcoffee.com/cold-brew-coffee-with-the-toddy-coffee-maker/) looks similar to the vacuum brewer but no heating is required and the chamber containing the grounds tends to be bigger to accommodate much more grounds than the vacuum method. The coffee brewed in this method is concentrated so it is normally served either in a mixture with water or ice-blended with milk. The above brewing methods are commonly used in the home environment, while in a commercial setup, coffee is usually brewed in batches using the drip method or if individually brewed, then the vacuum brewer is used for its esthetic appeal and cleaner cup. Except for the espresso brewing method where the machine is differently built for home and commercial requirements, there is really no difference in quality for coffee brewed at home and in cafes using the same method, assuming proper skill or procedure is followed. Even with the advent of new brewing technology and methods, such as the Clover commercial single-cup brewer for business and the [Aeropress](https://ineedcoffee.com/aeropress-coffee-maker-tutorial/) for a home setup, the basic principle of brewing remains the same, thus it is possible to make a great cup of coffee at home. The difference or the main advantage of the commercial brewer lies in the control, consistency, and repeatability capabilities of the Clover in making consistently good coffee with the same taste profile cup after cup, and this is a major milestone in commercial brewing. And another key differentiator of Clover is its single-cup brewing approach that allows brew-on-demand, just like making espresso. With the above short explanation of each brewing method, the following table attempts to summarize the pros and cons of these methods in relation to making a single cup, to our best knowledge and unbiased evaluation. Note that the [Turkish brewing method](https://ineedcoffee.com/preparing-a-traditional-turkish-coffee/) using an Ibrik is not mentioned here because it is a rarely used method, except for its Ibrik pots that are more of a collectors’ item among coffee lovers. Method Pros Cons Drip – Easy to use & clean – Can make multiple cups at one go – Generally not designed for 1-cup brewing. The water flow rate is constant regardless of the number of cups – Water too hot for the grounds – Home brewer’s showerhead typically directs water to the center of the grounds, resulting in uneven extraction and wastage. Exception: Technivorm brewer. – Cup warmer spoils the flavor instead of keeping coffee warm. Wrong concept. – Slow brew leads to a more bitter cup. French press – Suitable for 1-cup brewing – Produces a strong cup – Easy to use & clean – Cheapest brewer & method – Substantial amount of sediments at bottom of the cup, which adds more body to the coffee. Wrong perception. – Coffee cools down faster due to glass-made brewer – Long brewing duration leads to more caffeine in the cup Vacuum – Most beautiful brewer and brewing method. High esthetic value – Clean cup with true flavor – Difficult to clean. Easy to break the glass parts. – Requires skill to make a good cup – Expensive Moka-pot, Neapolitan flip-flop – High esthetic value with various designs – Stove-top heat source tends to boil the water too fast – Not easy to make a good cup due to control over the heat transfer rate – Water too hot tends to burn the coffee oil, thus affecting the flavor Pourover, Swiss Gold filter, & equivalents – Similar concept to drip method except that it is manual – Full control over water flow rate and grounds coverage – Easier to make a good brew – Suitable for 1-cup brewing – Non-uniform extraction due to relatively long-brewing that cools down the brew along the way – Pinch of sediments noticeable in the case of metal or plastic filter. Paper filters do not have this problem. Aeropress – Fast extraction with espresso grinds & pump pressure through a micro-filter minimizes caffeine content while maximizing flavors – Easiest to clean among all brewers – Use of manual pump pressure compensates for the low brewing temperature that does not burn away flavor. Instead more flavors are being extracted. – Full control over brewing variables – Produces better quality coffee than most methods, & flavor compared to much more expensive commercial brewers such as the Clover. – No esthetic value due to a more laboratory apparatus looking parts – Borrows concept from espresso brewing method but does not produce espresso – Full control over brewing variables also leads to inconsistency in brew quality At the end of the day, appreciating a good cup of coffee does not require a big crowd. Coffee is a personal thing that requires peace of mind and the environment to sieve out the nuances and delicate flavors of the blends and origins. A demitasse or a tasse at most is all that will make your day complete and satisfying. ### Resources [Buying a French Press – Picking the Right One](https://ineedcoffee.com/buying-a-french-press-picking-the-right-one/) – Guide for purchasing a French Press coffee maker.

# Choosing the Right Coffee Grinder [Grinding Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/grinding-coffee/)---by [Malcolm Pang](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/malcolm-pang/)![Choosing the Right Coffee Grinder](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/choosing-the-right-coffee-grinder/grounds1-414x1831.jpg) Roasted coffee beans must be ground to break the beans into smaller pieces so as to increase the surface area necessary for extraction. The finer the grind size, the faster the extraction, and vice versa. Depending on the brewing method/equipment, the right size must be adopted so that the rate of extraction is ideal and fewer sediments go into the cup. Due to oxidation that will stale the coffee grounds as soon as the beans are ground, it is always recommended to grind the coffee beans just before brewing and with the right amount. So, what are the different types of grinders? Burr and blade grinders.![coffee grinds](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/grounds1-414x1831.DegyGzKI_Z2wB9kx.webp)_Ground Coffee_ To start with, the blade grinder is the cheapest and the most straightforward coffee grinder commonly found in most shopping malls. Equipped with a motor and a blade, the user just has to throw in the beans, cover the grinder, and press the power button. The grinding blade will rotate, whack through the beans, and break them into small pieces. The grind size depends on the duration of the grind. That is, a finer grind is achieved by leaving the grinder on for a few more seconds. A very simple process, but the weakness is the lack of control and consistency of the grind size. Regardless of the duration of the grind, the grounds will contain sizes ranging from powder to chunks. The difference is just the quantity of these sizes. Next is the burr grinder. **There are two types of burr grinders: flat blade and conical.** The conical burr grinder has 2 cone-shaped burrs facing each other at a distance that determines the grind size. Coffee beans are fed between them and crushed into uniform grind particles when one of the burrs rotates while the other is stationary. The flat-blade grinder also comes with 2 flat and parallel blade burrs that provide a shearing effect on the coffee beans, thus achieving a uniform and larger surface area for extraction. So the choice between blade and burr grinders is obvious: **always go for the burr grinders**. The next selection criteria are on the different types of burr grinders. Burr grinders can be further categorized based on the speed, dosing capability, and the type of grind adjustment available. In terms of speed, there are (direct-drive) high-speed, gear-reduction low-speed, and direct-drive low-speed grinders. The entry-level burr grinder is the high-speed direct-drive grinder, whereby the high-speed motor is connected directly to the burrs. Though high speed, it gives rise to heat that affects the quality of the end grounds, noise that is not so pleasing to the ears, and the static that will lump the grounds into chunks that can adversely affect the packing of the coffee cake in the portafilter when making espresso. Nevertheless, with these disadvantages, these grinders will still do their job of producing uniform grinds at a low price point. The gear-reduction low-speed and direct-drive low-speed grinders are the best grinders around and are commonly used in commercial setups (such as cafes) and at the home by coffee enthusiasts. They offer little or no static, much lesser or no heat, and quiet operation, all these owing to the low RPM (revolution per minute) of the grinder burr. The gear-reduction low-speed grinder has a high-speed motor connected to the burrs via a set of gears to reduce the speed and maintain the grinding power. The weakness, as expected, is the noisier grind as compared to the direct-drive low-speed grinders. So, if budget permits, go for the direct-drive low-speed grinders such that the La Scala MC4 or the Rancilio Rocky, available on The QARR Shop. Next in the selection of burr grinders is the choice between **doser and doserless grinders**. Dosers are designed to handle the volume of coffee in a commercial setup by allowing the barista to grind the beans in batches into a doser container that usually can hold up to around 6 dosages of grounds. A pull on the handle provided will dispense a single dose of grounds. Unless you are having a coffee party, most of the time, you will only make one or a couple of cups that do not warrant the need for a doser, inadvertently resulting in the wastage of unused grounds, staling of grounds, and additional parts for cleaning after usage. Advocates of doser will explain that the doser will resolve the static problem created by the grinder, but the need for freshly ground coffee in small quantities outweighs this problem. And the static problem can be easily taken care of if you use a direct-drive low-speed grinder. Personally, I will strongly recommend the home user to go for the doserless grinder. Finally, on the types of grind size adjustment, there are the stepped and the stepless adjustment grinders. Stepless means that you can have an infinite number of settings in terms of grind sizes. There are no preset stops where the grind setting will stop, unlike the stepped adjustment grinder. The choice here is subjective and individual, whether you need a guide in terms of the stepped adjustment or you are very particular about the slightest adjustment of the grind size. By the way, having stepped adjustments does not mean that there is a very limited number of steps or adjustments available. Some very good stepped grinders provide more than 50 steps, which in most cases are more than sufficient to satisfy even the most finicky coffee lovers in terms of grind controls. So the verdict is to go for a doserless, direct-drive low-speed burr grinder. As explained earlier, having a good grinder is the key to a consistent and quality brew in every cup.

# Cleaning the I-Roast 2 Coffee Roaster [Roasting Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/roasting-coffee/)---by [Michael Allen Smith](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/michael-allen-smith/)![Cleaning the I-Roast 2 Coffee Roaster](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/cleaning-the-i-roast-2-coffee-roaster/iroast-before-cleaning.jpg) I had delayed cleaning my I-Roast 2 coffee roaster until I noticed about 5% of the beans were still yellow and had not roasted. A seasoned roaster is good, but a home coffee roaster needs to be thoroughly cleaned at a certain point. Although I used an I-Roast 2, the following information applies to the original I-Roast Coffee roaster. Before we go through the cleaning methods, let me break down the I-Roast 2 into its components. From top to bottom: 1. Chaff collector lid – the top part 2. Chaff filter mesh – circular ring under the lid 3. Chaff collector base – fits on top of the roasting pot 4. Glass roasting pot – where the beans go 5. Power base assembly – the guts of the roaster that plugs into the wall The power base assembly (#5) can be cleaned with a paper towel or wet wipe. Nothing more. **Do NOT soak the power base assembly in water or put it in the dishwasher.** The rest of this article will focus on cleaning the other parts (#1-4).![iroast-lid-chaff-parts](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/iroast-lid-chaff-parts1.B2rmStxl_1PeCoi.webp)_From left to right: Chaff collector lid (#1), Chaff collector base (#3), Chaff filter mesh (#2)_![iroast-before-cleaning](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/iroast-before-cleaning.CbtyYMC-_ZstGs8.webp)_The I-Roast 2 glass roasting pot (#4) before the cleaning._ As you can see from the photos, my coffee roaster was a mess. I ended up using three different cleaning methods to bring back the shine. All three methods are valid. Use one or a combination—whatever works. ### #1 Puro Caff or Espresso Machine Cleaner I soaked the parts in a bucket of hot water, poured in some Puro Caff, and waited twenty minutes. With a rag, I was able to get them somewhat clean, but not clean enough. It was time to bring out the big gun. ### #2 Oven Cleaner At this point, I sprayed the parts with an oven cleaner. After letting it sit for 20 minutes, I could remove almost everything. It just needed a tiny bit more cleaning. ### #3 Dishwasher I placed all the parts on the top rack of the dishwasher and ran a cycle. That was all it needed to regain its “almost new” look.![iroast-after-cleaning](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/iroast-after-cleaning.Bm37n7np_1sk2kn.webp)_Almost new! It’s time to start the seasoning process all over._ Having a roaster that is too clean or too dirty is not ideal. The best results come from the middle ground, where the roaster is seasoned. This is why I waited until I started getting uneven roasts before I did the three-stage cleaning. ### Resources [I-Roast 2 Coffee Roasting Guide](https://ineedcoffee.com/roasting-coffee-in-a-popcorn-popper/) – INeedCoffee article by Chris Arnold.

# Cleaning and Maintaining your Bodum Santos / Utopia Vac Pot [Brewing Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/brewing-coffee/)---by [Lura Lee](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/lura-lee/)![Cleaning and Maintaining your Bodum Santos / Utopia Vac Pot](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/cleaning-and-maintaining-your-bodum-santos-utopia-vac-pot/clean3.jpg)_The Starbucks Utopia brewer was released later as the Bodum Santos. This article was written in 2002 when the Utopia was released, but the tips also apply to the Bodum Santos brewer._ The Utopia vac pot brewing system is made of plastic and has built-in electrical components, so cleaning and maintaining it is not as easy as maintaining other coffee equipment, such as the French Press. And one mistake can cause you to have to spend more time cleaning down the line. This article will walk you step-by-step through the proper cleaning process. Additionally, this article includes tips and tricks for successful Utopia use and enjoyment.![utopia before cleaning](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/dirty11.CCG0FD2o_mqzwU.webp)_Utopia Vac Pot before cleaning_![Utopia Vac pot after cleaning](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/clean3.DrJxwepf_oop3d.webp)_Utopia Vac pot after cleaning_### What you need in order to clean - a soft cloth - a chopstick - a bottle brush or flex-head toothbrush - baking soda - 409 (or similar cleaner) ### What you should avoid The biggest mistake that you can make with the Utopia is to use harsh cleaning tools. Do not, under any circumstances, use one of those sponges with the abrasive side. Scrubby sponges scratch the plastic and leave it cloudy. **Once the plastic is scratched, more oils will build up and you’ll just have to clean it more and more often.**### The Name Game The key to understanding this article is understanding the names of the parts of the Utopia.![Utopia parts](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/equipnum_150.C8z0-9Hp_1zBLRq.webp)_Utopia Vac Pot Equipment_1. Basket Lid 2. Coffee Filter Basket 3. Filter 4. Arm Rest 5. Base 6. Heating Element 7. Coffee Pot 8. Coffee Pot Lid ### Step #1 – Rinse and Begin Rinse all remaining coffee out of the pot and the coffee filter basket (top chamber). Disassemble the coffee pot lid. Disassemble the armrest (for the coffee filter basket) on the base. Remove the coffee filter and place it in a bowl with warm water and about a tablespoon of baking soda. Agitate the water occasionally and let it soak while you clean the rest of the equipment.![soak filter](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/filter.BFXAiud8_DvcT9.webp)_Soak the Utopia filter_### Step #2 – Clean the Heating Element At the base of the pot, there is a heating element. The fact that it is connected to the pot is the reason why you can’t put the pot in the dishwasher. But the thing gets dirty over time and has burnt coffee on it. How do you get it clean? A thick paste of baking soda and some elbow grease. Mix up a paste of baking soda in a bowl to the side. Then use a bottle brush or a flex-head toothbrush to apply the paste, and use the bristles to scrub the bottom concurrently. If you can’t get all of it, just do what you can and let the baking soda break up the rest of the oil by setting the pot to the side. ### Step #3 – Clean the Coffee Filter Basket Shake a little bit of baking soda on your wet cloth. Use the chopstick and the baking soda laden cloth to clean the tube. Rinse the cloth, then apply more baking soda. Make sure that the baking soda dissolves on the cloth. Undissolved baking soda will scratch, which is what you want to avoid doing to the plastic. Vigorously wipe the inside of the basket with the cloth. Use the toothbrush to clean between the plastic teeth on the lid.![Cleaning filter basket](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/stick2.D821w2lQ_Z1xJARU.webp)_Cleaning filter basket._### Step #4 – Clean the Base and Lid Wipe the base of the Utopia with 409 and a dry cloth. Use the toothbrush and baking soda to clean the armrest. If the coffee is caked in there, soak the armrest in the same bowl as the coffee filter. ### Step #5 – Clean the Coffee Pot Once you’ve rinsed the baking soda paste from the heating element, use the soft cloth and baking soda to clean the inside of the pot. Use the chopstick to guide the cloth around the sides and clean the pot. The baking soda does an excellent job of cleaning the pot without the suds and aftertaste associated with soap.![Wipe the Utopia Vac Pot](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/wipe.t5Iaad4G_Z2s5BaD.webp)_Wipe the Utopia Vac Pot._### Step #6 – Run a Water Cycle Rinse and reassemble all of the pieces. Run a clear water cycle with no coffee. This might produce a few rattling sounds (the filter is usually weighed down by coffee).![Water rinse Utopia Vac Pot](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/water_rinse.DtTpo6rn_Z2fwCTT.webp)_Water rinse Utopia Vac Pot_ Between major cleanings, rinse the Utopia and use only a soft cloth to wipe it down. ### Additional Utopia Tips Here are some things that might help you with your Utopia. These are fairly disconnected tips, but they’ve been suggested from various sources for inclusion in this article.**Stopped mid-brew** If your Utopia stops mid-brew, you’ll have to throw out the pot of coffee and start again. It tastes horrible when it double-brews. Turn over the base of the Utopia and, if you haven’t removed it already, you’ll see a clear plastic ring that goes around the base. This ring is supposed to keep the base from sliding around on your counter. The problem with it is that it can get displaced and cause the sensors in the base of the Utopia to miscalculate. This can sometimes cause incomplete brew cycles and double brews. Starbucks recommends the removal if you have this type of problem.![plastic ring ](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/bottom.r27KFb7U_2f9mAc.webp)_There is a plastic ring around the base_**Coffee is Clumping and not making Full Contact With Water** Occasionally, the water rises up from the pot but seems not to mix with the coffee. Meanwhile, the coffee basically sits in a big blob along the side of the basket. If this happens, remove the lid from the basket, and be careful not to break the seal that the basket has with the pot. Use a knife or spoon to gently mix the coffee with the water.**Coffee Tastes Weak**1. Make sure that you’re brewing a full pot. The Utopia works best when running at full capacity. 2. Try a **slightly** finer grind, but don’t go all the way to the espresso grind or your filter won’t be able to handle the extra work. 3. Vac Pot coffee has more clarity than French Press, so it may taste a little ‘weaker’ by virtue of the fact that more oils and sediments have been filtered out.**Broken Filter** Apparently, there were some problems with the first batch of filters. So if your filter breaks, call Starbucks (1-800-Starbucks) and they’ll replace the first one for free. I’ve had my first filter as long as I’ve had the vac pot, but quite a few other people have had problems. I’m also beginning to see some Utopia filters for sale in my local Starbucks stores. Strangely, however, they’re not selling them online. My advice: complain to Starbucks and see if you can get a replacement for free. You probably will. ### Final Thoughts To date, I’ve made hundreds of pots of coffee with my vac pot. The vast majority of them have gone smoothly, but occasionally I’ve had to throw out a pot. It’s great for guests, who love to watch the spectacle, and it’s perfect for people who aren’t accustomed to French Press coffee. Plus, I love that this vac pot is easy to clean up and the fact that I get more consistent results with the Utopia than I do with other vac pot brands. I hope that you enjoy your Utopia as much as I’ve enjoyed mine. Published on June 1, 2002--- #### Lura Lee Lura Lee enjoys coffee, but no longer pursues coffee as a hobby.

# Clean Your Coffee Machine – It’s worth it [Espresso](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/espresso/)---by [Bernard Schnacke](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/bernard-schnacke/)![Clean Your Coffee Machine – It’s worth it](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/clean-your-coffee-machine-its-worth-it/clean-your-coffee-machine.jpg) Raise your hand if you’ve cleaned your coffee or espresso machine lately. I thought so. Some have, but many haven’t.  Some can’t remember the last time they did it. Which is surprising, given how much we care about our coffee. This tutorial can give you a better cup of coffee, espresso, cappuccino, latte, and more, with a quick demo of why and how to descale your machine.![Clean Limescale](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/clean-coffee-machine2._jglW_RZ_Bbawf.webp) ### Why Descaling removes limescale. Lime deposits form when tap water is heated. Tap water contains minerals, such as calcium and magnesium carbonate, because groundwater seeps through mineral-rich rock or soil before entering the drinking supply. Here are four reasons to descale your machine, saving the best for last. 1. Lime deposits extend brew time and diminish heat transfer, lowering espresso quality. 2. Lime deposits build up over time and can clog and corrode the machine. 3. Lime deposits make machines less efficient, which wastes energy and has a negative impact on the environment. 4. Lime deposits degrade coffee taste. Coffee is as complex as wine when it comes to taste, and coffee varieties can exhibit a multitude of intriguing flavor notes. The coffee flavor wheel identifies 80+ flavor notes, including cherry, nutmeg, hazelnut, woody, whisky, chocolate, jasmine, fresh, malt, smoky, and more. Flavor notes not welcomed by coffee connoisseurs include limescale, calcified, magnesium, moldy, and bacterial. Decalcification lets the true flavor of coffee beans shine through, without interference.![Durgol ](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/durgol-clean.CFYFQpvD_2p2flQ.webp) ### What Made in Switzerland, Durgol Swiss Espresso is a specialized decalcifier for espresso machines of all brands – plus pod/capsule coffee machines, manual coffee makers, tea kettles, and electric water heaters. Durgol works up to 10 times faster than other branded decalcifiers. Durgol comes ready to use in single-portion bottles. Durgol will not damage your espresso machine or leave a residue that can clog it or impart odors. Durgol packaging is environmentally compatible and recyclable. ### How This decalcification demo shows how to do it._[Durgol Swiss Espresso: Unless You Want Your Machine to Die of a Heart Attack – Durgol & Frieling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7c1U_Mjl0Jc) by Frieling USA, Inc._1. Pour one single-portion bottle (4.2 fluid ounces) of Durgol Swiss Espresso into the water tank. 2. Dilute the descaler with tap water according to the manufacturer’s instructions. 3. Start the decalcification program. If no instructions are given, add tap water into the water tank until the automatic program can be started. 4. Catch the outflowing water in a glass or plastic container that is large enough to prevent splashing. Be careful – liquid can be hot. 5. Rinse the machine with tap water according to the manufacturer’s guidelines.![Durgol vs Vinegar vs Citric Acid 1](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/compare-1.CmyWMDwb_vj6Rx.webp)_What’s the most effective cleaner for your coffee machine? We put Durgol, vinegar and citric acid to the test._![Durgol vs Vinegar vs Citric Acid 2](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/compare-2.Y-XNCPRp_1t9Ej.webp)_After just 1 second, Durgol is working to remove limescale buildup._![Durgol vs Vinegar vs Citric Acid 3](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/compare-3.CHgBfWhu_JaVtb.webp)_After about 2 minutes, Durgol is the only product that removes 100% of the limescale._### Not How Some people decalcify with vinegar or citric acid, but we do not recommend this. Vinegar or vinegar essence products have an unpleasant smell. Plastic components inside the machine can absorb this objectionable taste, which will then leach back into your espresso. When you decalcify with citric acid, residue can form and clog the fine lines and valves of your espresso machine. Lime deposits can become sealed under an unremovable layer of residue formed by citric acid. ### More In addition to espresso machines, Durgol works with pod/capsule coffee makers, manual coffee makers, tea kettles, and water heaters. Here’s how: 1. Unplug the appliance and let it cool. 2. Pour one 4.2-ounce bottle of Durgol Swiss Espresso into it. You will see a bubbling action that will last for a few minutes. 3. Once the bubbling action subsides, fill the vessel with tap water and wait 15 minutes. 4. Then rinse the interior with tap water. Do not heat the tea kettle or water heater until it has been rinsed after decalcification is complete. ### When Decalcify your machines at least every six months, or according to the manufacturer’s instructions.![](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/durgol-1.CTwKNcWA_Z2pECst.webp)_Durgol Special Descaler_### Resources [FAQ](https://www.durgol.com/global_en/information-and-tips/faq) – Durgol answers the most frequently asked questions on their site.

# How Climate Change Is Affecting Our Coffee [Coffee Business](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/coffee-business/)---by [Nick Huxsted](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/nick-huxsted/)![How Climate Change Is Affecting Our Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/climate-change-affecting-coffee/coffee-rust.jpg) Extreme weather patterns caused by climate change are having a dramatic affect on coffee production throughout the world. Rising temperatures, increased rainfall and the proliferation of pests have all played their part in destroying coffee plantations in almost every coffee-producing nation across the globe. For many of us living in the western world, the tangible impact of lower coffee yields will be nothing more than an increase in the price of our morning coffee and a potential reduction in the quality of our coffee. Not ideal, but hardly a life changing event that will fundamentally alter the manner in which we live our lives. The 25 million households who rely on the coffee crop to feed their families will not been as fortunate. A recent report by Oxfam suggests that climate change and its influence on coffee production could be setting the fight against world hunger back by decades. There is news of malnutrition in parts of Nicaragua, with many families struggling to find enough money to pay for food. In a country where a third of the working population relies on a productive coffee harvest, the effects of climate change are being felt now. With so many reports and estimations on the impact of rising CO2 emissions by the year 2050, we can sometimes forget that the impact is already here. Climate change is particularly problematic for the coffee industry as the plants are susceptible to relatively small environmental changes. Originating from Ethiopia, the plants prefer to grow in the tropical and sub-tropical regions between the tropic of Cancer and Capricorn. For many of the developing countries located within this Goldilocks zone, namely Rwanda, Honduras, Guatemala, Ethiopia and Peru, climatic changes and unpredictable weather has had a devastating effect. ### How Climate Change Affects Coffee Plantations #### _Loss of habitat_ The two main types of coffee used throughout the world are the Arabica bean and Robusta variety. Arabica is generally considered to be of higher quality, with Robusta used in many instant coffees. Unfortunately the Arabica plant is less resilient that Robusta, and according to research conducted by Kew Gardens in the UK, could be extinct by the year 2080 if climate change continues at its current rate. A temperature rise of only 3 degrees will see two thirds of the current coffee plantations in Brazil become unsuitable for growing coffee. With an expected global increase of anywhere between two and four degrees over the next hundred years, changes need to occur to reverse this trend. Educational initiatives have been set up to help teach local farmers more efficient farming and production techniques. Planting new trees, soil management and farming techniques that minimise deforestation, all contribute towards ensuring the coffee plant has the best environment possible for its growth and development. Further collaboration between the coffee-drinking nations of the world and the coffee-producing countries will be required to further minimize the inequality of climate change. Inequality, where the people producing the least CO2, are affected the most. #### _Coffee Rust_ Coffee Rust (La Roya) is a fungal parasite and first became a problem as late back as 1870. At the time, Ceylon (now Sri Lanka) was exporting 100 million pounds of coffee a year. In less than 20 years, Coffee Rust had reduced this figure to a mere 5 million pounds of coffee a year. Production had essentially stopped. Quarantine of the fungus was enforced, and for almost a hundred years, it appeared to have worked. In 1970, the fungus was found in Brazil, and since then, it has spread to almost every coffee-growing nation in the world. In 2012, Colombia lost almost 50% of its coffee yield due to La Roya. The increased rainfall provided more favourable conditions for the fungus, allowing it to spread throughout the plantations. The disease covers the leaves of the plant, reducing photosynthesis and ultimately killing the plants. Up until 3 years ago the disease wasn’t a major concern in Nicaragua. Since then the warmer conditions have allowed La Roya to multiply, destroying so much of the crop that estimates predict that by 2050, 80% of the coffee harvest will be lost. Where the coffee industry accounted for 20% of the countries GDP, now many workers and farmers have resorted to picking fallen beans from the ground in an attempt to earn enough money for a meal.![coffee rust](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/coffee-rust.nxsVSkIp_1oij2Y.webp)_Coffee rust – Source: Howard F. Schwartz, Colorado State University, Bugwood.org_#### _Berry Borer Beetle_ As if local farmers didn’t have enough to deal with, the Berry Borer Beetle is compounding the problem by laying their eggs in the coffee berries that either, destroy the coffee bean, or lowers the value and quality of coffee produced. Until the 1980s, the pest was exposed to a few small pockets throughout the world, but with the increase in temperature, the beetle has spread at a remarkable rate. Scientists have found that the beetle can’t reproduce at temperatures below 68 degrees. Historically, the mountainsides, with their rich volcanic soil, were too cool for the Berry Borer Beetle. As temperatures have risen, the pest has spread up the mountainside, causing widespread devastation to coffee yields. Without the economic resources to support communities, educate farmers, take out crop insurance, and adapt to new farming technologies, climate change is a problem that needs a collaborative approach. Governments, farmers, consumers, and companies all have a responsibility to ensure that we’re doing all we can to try and minimise and hopefully reverse its impact.![coffee borer beetle](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/coffee-borer-beetle.D1-p2G-9_Z9y5Mz.webp)_[Coffee borer beetle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffee_borer_beetle) by L. Shyamal_### What can we do? While the topic of climate change is diverse and complex, there are simple things we, as consumers, can do to help. In the US, 25 billion disposable cups of coffee are thrown away every year, and in the UK, it’s 2.5 billion. The cups with their polymer lining will never degrade and all form part of an extensive manufacturing process responsible for the production of CO2. Simple gestures that can actually save us money (many coffee shops offer a discount to people who use reusable cups) all contribute towards the global effort of reducing CO2 emissions and their impact on the environment.![disposable cups](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/disposable-cups.6BacMlVC_2kSbmQ.webp)_[Trash Mountain](https://flic.kr/p/3ikBKy) by woodleywonderworks_ If you’re the owner of a coffee shop then it may be worthwhile investigating how your used coffee grounds can be recycled. One company in the UK, Bio-Bean, is taking the leftover coffee waste and using it to create bio-fuel. The more we can recycle leftover materials the better it will be for the environment. Another intriguing solution to the problem is looking at how DNA research is being used to uncover the genetic diversity of the coffee plant. After four years of research, the University of Buffalo has succeeded in sequencing the DNA of the coffee bean that could be used to breed more disease-resistant variations of the plant. What scientists have shown is that if we all do nothing, then orange juice may be the drink of choice for many of us in the morning. ### Resources [How will climate change affect what we eat?](https://www.oxfamamerica.org/explore/stories/how-will-climate-change-affect-what-we-eat/) – Report by Oxfam [EcoFriendlyCoffee.org](https://ecofriendlycoffee.org/) – INeedCoffee’s sister site focuses on the environmental side of coffee.

# Cleaning Your Burr Grinder [Grinding Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/grinding-coffee/)---by [Joseph Robertson](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/joseph-robertson/)![Cleaning Your Burr Grinder](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/cleaning-your-burr-grinder/cleaning-your-burr-coffee-grinder.jpg) “I have a confession to make. I’ve had my coffee grinder for 10 years…and never once have I cleaned it.” – Someone you might know. I think the idea of regularly cleaning your coffee grinder – or even any coffee machine equipment – is not something most home brewers consider. It seems alright. You only use it for coffee, right? And you purge the grinder whenever you switch coffees, so that’s fine, right? You will probably be disgusted, then, to find all of the oils, chaff, and random coffee grounds stuck in places in your grinder that you didn’t even consider. This stuff inevitably builds over time. Whether you think you can’t tell or not is somewhat irrelevant. You’ve got old organic matter caking itself to parts of a machine you think is helping you make the freshest coffee possible. The good news is that cleaning your coffee grinder can be a relatively simple task. In this guide, I’m going to show you how to do a pretty thorough and regular cleaning of your electric burr coffee grinder, which will only take you 5-10 minutes once you get the hang of it. We will not be taking apart anything that can’t be very easily put back together with minimal knowledge/skill/experience. In this guide, I’ll be showing you the steps using an OXO Barista Brain Grinder and a Baratza Encore. Both of these are higher-end ‘entry-level’ electric burr grinders. Most conical burr coffee grinders will be quite similar to these two, so you can follow along. ### You will need - Your Grinder - Urnex Grindz - A somewhat stiff-bristled brush (either a grinder cleaning brush or a toothbrush) - A microfiber cloth - (Optional) canned compressed air - (Optional) shop vac There are two goals here – remove any loose grounds that are relatively easily accessible and clean off as many built-up oils as possible. We are going to do this without disassembling the grinders past a certain point. We are just going to remove the easily removable parts so we don’t have to worry about disturbing some of the more delicate bits of the grinder. We finish the whole process using Urnex Grindz, which will completely clean the burrs for us. ### #1 Remove the hopper Any decent electric burr grinder will allow you to easily remove the hopper. On the Baratza Encore, you turn it all the way to the right (pointing just past the largest number). On the OXO grinder, there is a push-release button on the back. You can then wash your hopper with soap and water. Be sure to do so, as these easily build up oils. The Encore also has a rubber gasket you can simply lift straight out – this can be washed just with water (or a little bit of soap/water).![Remove Burr Grinder Hopper](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/clean-coffee-grinder-1-remove-hopper.BnMIKQfr_teTIt.webp) ### #2 Remove remaining loose pieces In the case of the OXO grinder, the bin that catches the coffee grounds and the metal plate it sits on (if you have the built-in scale version) both sit loosely. For cleaning, you will want to remove those and set them aside, or they’ll fly everywhere. With the Encore, remove the grounds bin and set it aside. You’ll also need to remove the rubber gasket on top of the outer burr.![Coffee Grinder Remove Parts For Cleaning](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/clean-coffee-grinder-2-remove-parts.CBB8pwnf_hylD7.webp)![Remove Burr grinder pieces for cleaning](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/clean-coffee-grinder-2b-remove-pieces.B1GXnUWr_MyiBu.webp) ### #3 Remove the outer burr In the case of the OXO and the Baratza, the outer burr is easily removable. With the Baratza, simply lift the burr straight out. With the OXO, you need to use the metal handle and give it a little turn counter-clockwise until you hear and feel a click, then you can lift it out.![Remove outer burr for cleaning grinder](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/clean-coffee-grinder-3-remove-outer-burr.B-ow-5Zg_Z1fM6rN.webp) ### #4 Clean the outer burr For this step, it’s helpful to have a brush. You can do this simply with a cheap toothbrush, but you might get yourself an actual grinder cleaning brush as they often have extra parts that aid with accessibility. Your outer burr probably has some area with caked coffee grounds. This is just a part of the grinder where coffee dust and oils have collected and is one of the primary reasons we take apart the grinder like this to clean. Just brush these areas down, and you will be good to go. Do NOT use water with the burr. It’s unnecessary and can lead to water damage pretty easily.![brush outer burr to clean grinder](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/clean-coffee-grinder-4-clean-outer-burr.DjyWVBAK_1lIBEx.webp) ### #5 Clean the inside of the grinder This part gets progressively more possible with the more tools you have at your disposal. You can start simply by using a brush to knock loose any grounds that are floating around, and then shake as much out as you can. Before turning your grinder upside down, make sure you’ve removed any loose-fitting parts that might fall out – if you are following along with the Baratza Encore or the OXO grinder, you’ve done that at this point. Canned air can be really helpful in getting loose coffee grounds and chaff out of otherwise impossible-to-reach places. Another tool you can use in this case is a shop vac, which will do quick work in completely removing all of the loose stuff from the inside of your grinder. If you don’t have a shop vac, you’ll get most of the way there with these steps.![Clean Inside coffee burr grinder](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/clean-coffee-grinder-5-clean-inside-grinder.mriBSEgG_20KHUt.webp) ### #6 Clean the coffee grounds output area I would like to give the coffee grounds an output chute and area that is a bit clean as well. The final step is going to involve running Grindz through the grinder, which will aid in cleaning out coffee oils and any remaining grounds/chaff from the burrs and output chute, but since we’re here the extra steps in cleaning can’t hurt. In the case of the OXO, it tends to hold on to a surprising amount of grounds and chaff. I find it necessary to knock the side of the grinder a few times, trying to dump as many grounds as possible out of the grinding chamber. You’ll also notice chaff tends to stick to the outside due to static. Wiping down the outside of the OXO with a cloth is the last step, and it is easy. The Encore does not hold on to many grounds – there’s a much shorter and more direct distance from the grinder burrs into the bin. But you can easily collect loose grounds and chaff in the bin area, which can be annoying to clean up. This is where canned air or a shop vac makes the process super easy. If you don’t have those, try to brush loose as much as possible, and wipe down with a microfiber cloth the rest of the outside.![clean grounds chute for coffee grounds](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/clean-coffee-grinder-6-clean-output.CF0VX_Wl_1vjg6q.webp) ### #7 Clean the coffee grounds bin The bin which collects the coffee grounds during the grinding process is something you can clean on a regular basis with simple soap and water. In the case of the OXO, it’s simply a cup that sits below the output. Take off the top and wash both with soap/water. The Encore’s bin is simple and you can wash it with soap/water. There will be oil buildup on the bin walls in both cases, so I find a little bit of soap necessary to completely clean.![burr grinder grounds bin clean](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/clean-coffee-grinder-7-grounds-bin.B4ATUDa9_Z24XL99.webp) ### #8 Put everything back together If you washed your hopper/gasket/bin with water, make sure 100% that these are dry. You do not want to introduce moisture to the interior of your grinder. To put it back together, simply reverse the initial steps. The most critical part of putting this all back together is the outer burr. In the case of both these grinders (and any grinder you use), there’s going to be one spot where the outer burr sits. The Encore’s outer burr will slot right into the grinder with no force – but in one specific spot. You should gently try to rotate the burr after fitting it in place. There should be minimal movement from side to side. If the burr easily rotates around, then you either haven’t found the spot to put it in, or some of the tabs on the plastic casing may be broken. In my Encore, one tab has a red marking which I use to guide where the burr should be placed (that red marker is always in one spot). The OXO works slightly differently, as you need to turn and click the burr back into place. Again, it only fits in one way, so if you aren’t able to get it to click into place, then it’s not sitting quite right for you. After the burr is in place, you need to add back the hopper. In the case of the Encore, place the rubber gasket back first (again, this only fits in one way – the notches on the rubber gasket will line up with ridges on the outer burr).![reassemble burr coffee grinder](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/clean-coffee-grinder-8-reassemble.Bp-O3bS9_YM7Np.webp) ### #9 Run Grindz through your grinder The last step is to simply run Grindz through your grinder. This will completely clean the burrs and pull out any remaining coffee grounds, chaff, and oils that are lingering. Grindz is made up of cereals and wood – it’s 100% food-safe, so you could even eat it if you wanted to. It’s designed to soak up the coffee oils in the grinder. For these simple home grinders, one capful or about 35-40g of the Grindz will be sufficient. Run it through like you would any coffee (I just set my burrs in the middle grinds setting, at 20 on the Encore and 15 on the OXO). Once you run through it, dump the Grindz into the trash.![run grindz through burr coffee grinder](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/clean-coffee-grinder-9-run-grindez.ZD35DbCh_1bcvRG.webp)![grindz exits the burr grinder](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/clean-coffee-grinder-9-grindz-finished.D1lPJR5G_Z1E6H4W.webp) ### #10 Prep to Brew (Optional) You’ll notice after running Grindz through that white dust remains. This is normal and not something you need to be concerned about – it’s 100% food safe so any possible incidental ingestion isn’t going to affect you. If you have a concern over its effect on the coffee’s taste, you can run a small batch of coffee through before brewing to purge any remaining Grindz. You can also give the hopper and bin a quick wipe. Once you get the hang of the above, a quick cleaning can be done in 10 minutes (minus drying time if you wash the removable components). I recommend doing a quick cleaning like this once a month or at the very least once every 3 months, depending on how often you use your grinder. ### Video Tutorials Check out these two videos by Coffee Lovers TV for comprehensive video guides on cleaning the OXO and Baratza grinders._[How To Clean Your Coffee Grinder – Featuring the Oxo Barista Brain Grinder](https://youtu.be/1PacdCirO_Y) – Coffee Lovers TV__[Cleaning Your Coffee Grinder – Part 2 – The Baratza Encore](https://youtu.be/aD1etnljg6Y) – Coffee Lovers TV_ Published on March 17, 2018--- #### Joseph Robertson [Follow Joseph Robertson on X](https://x.com/extractedmag)Extracted Magazine is a digital publication guiding coffee drinkers of all levels towards connoisseurship through exploring the craft of coffee and the people/companies involved.

# A Clever Way To Make Iced Coffee [Brewing Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/brewing-coffee/)---by [Michael Allen Smith](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/michael-allen-smith/)![A Clever Way To Make Iced Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/clever-way-make-iced-coffee/clever-iced-coffee.jpg) We have several tutorials on INeedCoffee that walk through the steps for making cold brew coffee. But until now, we haven’t written a guide for making iced coffee. The terms cold brew coffee and iced coffee sometimes become interchangeable, but they do have different meanings. And they taste different, too. ### Cold Brew vs Iced Coffee Cold Brew is coffee brewed at room or cold temperatures for several hours. The most common brew times are between 12 and 24 hours, but you can brew longer. The grounds tend to be coarser. The resulting coffee brew is often a concentrate, which is later cut with water to bring it back to an ideal strength. Fans of cold brew like the low acidity and smooth body. It also tends to be high in caffeine because the brewing period is so long. Iced coffee, also called Japanese iced coffee, is made by brewing coffee directly over ice. This instantly chills the coffee, while preserving the flavor. To avoid having watery coffee, the amount of water used when brewing is split between the hot water and the ice. Many coffee aficionados prefer iced coffee to cold brew as it tastes like a chilled, refreshing version of that hot coffee. Whatever acidity level or flavor notes the hot version has will remain. And if you get the water ratio right, it won’t taste weak. Another advantage iced coffee has over cold brew is that it is much faster to make. ### Why Use the Clever Coffee Dripper? You could brew iced coffee in a number of ways, but the Clever is an ideal choice. It has a paper filter, which results in a cleaner finish. The Clever is also a full immersion brewing method. This means the coffee remains in contact with the water for the majority of the brew cycle. This will allow us to control the brewing time better than we could with a pour-over method, resulting in a richer coffee. Another excellent choice would be the [AeroPress](https://ineedcoffee.com/upside-aeropress-coffee-brewing-tutorial/).![ground-coffee-in-clever-dripper-ice-jar](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/ground-coffee-in-clever-dripper-ice-jar.Bl6PDWP9_2oYkOO.webp) ### The Math of Iced Coffee The math of iced coffee is the same as that of hot coffee, with one exception. The water weight we normally use for hot coffee is divided between hot water and ice. When finished, the goal is not to have a jar full of coffee and ice cubes but to just use enough ice to cool the coffee. We can always add more ice later. Our goal is to mimic the taste of hot coffee but chilled. I experimented with several water to ice ratios and varying brew times. Here is the iced coffee recipe that tasted best: - 20 grams of medium or medium-fine ground coffee (see the [Coffee Grind Chart](https://ineedcoffee.com/coffee-grind-chart/)) - 180 grams of hot water - 120 grams of ice cubes - 3-4 minute brew time Use a slightly finer grind than you would for the hot version because you are brewing with less water. This recipe uses a 15-1 ratio. 15 parts water to 1 part coffee. Adjust the ratio to your taste. For this tutorial, we will combine several steps that we broke down in detail in the article [Step By Step Bonavita Immersion Coffee Dripper](https://ineedcoffee.com/step-step-bonavita-immersion-coffee-dripper-tutorial/), which operates similarly to the Clever Dripper. ### #1 Prepare the Coffee Place a #4 coffee filter inside the Clever. Rinse the filter. Add 20 grams of medium or medium-fine ground coffee.![Clever Coffee - Add Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/ccd-2.wY5P0-OJ_ZX95JN.webp) ### #2 Prepare the Ice Weigh out 120 grams of ice cubes and place them in a jar or mug. ### #3 Add Hot Water Add 180 grams of hot water slowly into the Clever Dripper. After a minute, you can stir slowly if you want. Aim for a total brew time of 3 to 4 minutes. ### #4 Release Coffee into Mug Place the Clever Dripper over your jar or mug with the ice. The lid will trigger the release of coffee onto the ice, and the coffee should melt most of the ice. ### ![clever-dripper-releasing-brew-on-to-ice](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/clever-dripper-releasing-brew-on-to-ice.CFTHoW0n_Z28oYXl.webp) ### #5 Serve and Maybe Add More Ice Take a sip. The coffee should taste as rich as the hot version. You can add more ice now to chill the coffee more. I usually do. It is that simple.![iced-coffee-in-a-glass](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/iced-coffee-in-a-glass.C20MHmrP_Z2ptAkj.webp) ### Troubleshooting If you use too little ice and your coffee is still warm and all the cubes are melted, don’t add more ice yet. The coffee might start out tasting fine, but as the ice melts, the coffee will taste progressively weaker and more watery. If you’ve brewed a cup with too little ice, place the coffee in the refrigerator to cool. ### Conclusion Making an iced coffee at home is very simple. Find your ideal brew strength ratio. Divide the brewing water into water and ice cubes. Grind a little finer. Then brew directly onto the ice. The flash cooling will preserve and often highlight the same flavors you enjoy when the beverage is hot. ### References [Step by Step Bonavita Immersion Coffee Dripper Tutorial](https://ineedcoffee.com/step-step-bonavita-immersion-coffee-dripper-tutorial/) – INeedCoffee brewing tutorial.

# Coconut Milk Coffee Ice Cream Recipe [Recipes](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/coffee-recipes/)---by [Kate Nickel](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/kate-nickel/)![Coconut Milk Coffee Ice Cream Recipe](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/coconut-milk-coffee-ice-cream-recipe/Coconut-Milk-Coffee-Ice-Cream-Recipe.jpg) Coconut milk is one of the best substitutes for dairy when you need something with enough fat to do the job of cream. I have been eating coconut milk-based ice cream for several years now and find that it does satisfy when I need that ice cream fix without any dairy. It is a good base for many flavors, especially coffee. In my neck of the woods, this brilliant idea is no secret: a few grocery stores in my area sell coconut milk ice cream, and a local ice cream parlor, Full Tilt, always carries a few flavors. I have the fortune of having my own ice cream maker, so I like to make my own so I can use the sweeteners I like best and experiment with my own flavors. Here is a recipe for coconut milk coffee ice cream. I find that espresso’s intense flavor is best, but you could also make about 2oz of concentrated drip coffee or use instant granules. Adding a sweetener in syrup form will help this not freeze up quite so hard in the freezer the next day. This recipe makes ~4 half-cup servings.![Pull espresso shots](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/pull-espresso-shots1.DWfZKL1T_1K4BG7.webp)_Use espresso or concentrated drip coffee for the ice cream._### What You Need - 1 15oz can of coconut milk - 1/3-1/2 cup (sugar or brown rice syrup) - 2 shots of espresso (regular or decaf) - small saucepan - ice cream machine ### Step By Step Directions 1. Pour coffee and coconut milk into the saucepan. Warm over medium heat. 2. Add sugar and stir until dissolved. 3. Remove from heat and refrigerate for several hours to overnight. The ice cream machine will not completely freeze the liquid enough if it is still warm. 4. Pour into the ice cream machine and let mix for 20-30 minutes until scoopable. 5. Store the remainder in the freezer if you manage to have leftovers.![coconut milk coffee ice cream](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/coconut-milk-coffee-ice-cream.C0YaURXf_1LHERc.webp)_Coconut Milk Coffee Ice Cream_### Resources [Homemade Coffee Ice Cream Recipe](https://ineedcoffee.com/homemade-coffee-ice-cream-recipe/) – Our milk-based coffee ice cream recipe.

# Coffee and Barbecue [Recipes](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/coffee-recipes/)---by [Chris Arnold](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/chris-arnold/)![Coffee and Barbecue](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/coffee-and-barbecue/Coffee-and-Barbecue.jpg) Coffee and Barbecue? Yep, Coffee and B-B-Q go hand-in-hand like, well, a couple of hands. Anyhow, we are going to show you a dry rub that works well on pork, as well as a sauce to go with that tasty hog flesh. The idea for integrating coffee and barbecue came when I was slow-cooking some pork ribs on a hot and humid summer day. I had been drinking iced tea, but what I really wanted was coffee. So, I started to experiment with iced coffee. Anyhow, one thing led to another, and I realized that along with my iced coffee, the pork would taste better if it, too, had some coffee overtones. The rub was a no-brainer, but the sauce didn’t come to me until later. The marriage of the two is really tasty, especially when enjoyed with a cold coffee drink. Although this recipe is designed for pork ribs and such, you may be able to come up with your own recipe for other types of BBQ, such as beef ribs, beer can chicken, or even a rack of lamb. Don’t be afraid to experiment! ### Squealin’ Good Wake-Me-Up Java Rub![Squealin&amp;#x27; Good Wake-Me-Up Java Rub](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/java-rub.bbeB_jMu_wdyuo.webp)_Squealin’ Good Wake-Me-Up Java Rub_- 1/3 cup of your Favorite Roasted Coffee Medium Grind (I like Ethiopian Yergacheffe, Ethiopian Lekempti, or Guatemala Antigua) - 2 Tbsp Brown Sugar - 2 Tbsp Kosher Salt - 1 Tbsp Fresh Ground Black Pepper - 1 Tbsp Chili Powder - 1 Tbsp Cumin - 1 Tbsp Garlic Powder Mix all ingredients well and apply generously to most cuts of pork. Pat into the meat well before grilling or smoking. We like to use it on baby backs or pork spareribs. This rub also works for pork loin and pork chops on the grill. Remember, the recipe above is a guideline. Don’t be afraid to experiment with other ingredients like rosemary, ginger, cinnamon, or nutmeg. ### Brown Eye Piggy Sauce![Brown Eye Piggy Sauce](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/piggy-sauce.O0dSaU8d_Z2sdQU0.webp)_Brown Eye Piggy Sauce_- 1 bottle of your favorite BBQ sauce (I like Sweet Baby Rays Hickory and Brown Sugar) - 4 ounces of your favorite triple-strength brewed coffee or some espresso (I like Papua New Guinea, Sumatra, or Java Estate). - 2 Tbsp Tabasco Sauce (I like Regular or Chipotle Tobasco) - 1 Tbsp Fresh Ground Black Pepper - 1 Tbsp of your Favorite Bourbon Whiskey (I like Makers Mark or Jack Daniels) If brewing your coffee, add three times the amount of coffee grounds as normal and only brew through about 4-6 ounces. If using espresso, pull two to three doubles. Mix all ingredients well. The BBQ sauce will thin. If it thins too much, have another bottle of sauce ready and add enough to attain the desired consistency. Apply to the final 15 minutes of your BBQ. Remember, the recipe above is a guideline. Don’t be afraid to experiment with other ingredients like apple juice, cilantro, fresh garlic, or molasses.

# Coffee and Brazil – How Coffee Molded the Culture of a Country [Coffee History](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/coffee-history/)---by [Jose Issamu Yamada](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/jose-issamu-yamada/)![Coffee and Brazil – How Coffee Molded the Culture of a Country](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/coffee-and-brazil-how-coffee-molded-the-culture-of-a-country/ilha-grande-brazil1.jpg) When Brazil was discovered in 1500 by the Portuguese, the country was inhabited by Indians only. Several new beverages were introduced to the Europeans, such as juices of several fruits, teas of several plants, and even an alcoholic drink made out of manioc. Just a few decades later, Brazil was importing thousands of black slaves from Africa; the slaves were used as manpower in the sugar-cane farms. The slaves were the first appreciators of a drink made out of the leftovers from the sugar production; that drink would later become known as cachaca. It was only in 1727 that the first coffee bush was planted in Brazil. Rumors go that the military Francisco de Melo Palheta used his personal attractions to persuade a Lady in French Guiana to give him samples of the coffee seed, which were then smuggled into Brazil.![Brazil Coffee Beans](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/brazilian-coffee.D49DPu3z_OiNdh.webp)_Brazil Coffee Beans_ Those seeds would change the History of the country. The Brazilian economy was based on the production of sugar in the States of the Northeast, using slave labor. Slavery continued, but the production shifted to coffee, now in the States of the South, where the seeds adapted better. Favorable natural conditions and a cheap labor force helped Brazil become the largest exporter of coffee in the World; during the last decades of the 19th Century and the first decades of the 20th Century, Brazil was a near monopolist of the international coffee market. The Economy of Brazil became entirely dependent upon coffee (and coffee farmers).![Ilha Grande, Brazil](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/ilha-grande-brazil1.Co3OmXUu_Z1Ajx7y.webp)_Ilha Grande, Brazil_ It was around the middle of the 19th Century that, for Humanitarian and Economic reasons, the Brazilian coffee farmers realized that slavery would not last much longer. The farmers pressed the Government to stimulate the immigration of people who could help in the coffee plantations. For several decades, many immigrants came to Brazil, with the specific purpose of working on coffee farms. The most numerous were the Italians, but there were also significant numbers of Germans, Spaniards, Polish, Arabians, Japanese, and many others. The State of Sao Paulo, with ample areas of purple land (proper for coffee), became the main producer and main Economic and Political center in the country. Later on, the profits from the coffee (and the labor skills of the immigrants) would be used to fund the industrialization of the State. This explains why Sao Paulo is still the largest and richest state in the country. So, looking at the rich and diversified culture of Brazil today, one may say that much of it is thanks to coffee.

# Coffee and Dieting [Coffee and Health](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/coffee-health/)---by [Michael Allen Smith](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/michael-allen-smith/)![Coffee and Dieting](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/coffee-and-dieting/latte-art-coffee1.jpg)_NOTE: The intended audience for this article is the average coffee drinker who happens to be overweight. This is not intended as medical advice. This article is not geared toward athletes who are already lean and are trying to reduce body fat levels further. The author is a fitness-conscious coffee drinker- not a doctor, nutritionist, or dietary expert. Specific dieting questions should be directed at health professionals, not the author._ When it comes to losing fat, there are many diets to choose from. There are thousands of diets that combine food choices in such a way as to reduce caloric intake and cause fat loss. Most diets work; however, not every diet works for every person. One of the goals of dieting is to find a diet you can follow. Hopefully, you’ll find a lifestyle diet that will be easy to stick to once the excess fat is gone. Picking a diet that restricts you too much will be difficult to follow and increase your chances of failure. Here at INeedCoffee, we believe that any diet without coffee will be a miserable disaster. I’d rather be 20 pounds overweight sipping on a hot mug of freshly roasted coffee than lean with only memories of coffees consumed long ago. That said, I decided to seek a diet that puts coffee first. To my knowledge, none exists. It is our duty to create a diet or modify an existing one so we coffee drinkers can lose the fat and not abandon our favorite beverage. Although we strive to drink coffee in our diets, coffee alone shouldn’t be the basis of that diet. Most of our energy should still come from food. ### Caffeine as a Fat-Loss Supplement In addition to coffee’s role in the most popular diets, let’s briefly address how caffeine can be used to lose fat. There are many fat loss supplements at the nutrition store where the primary ingredient is caffeine. Supplements such as Metabolife, Ripped Fuel, and Beta Lean HP combine caffeine and ephedra (Ma Huang). This combination has been effective at promoting fat loss while preserving muscle. Although there are some critics of ephedra-based supplements regarding safety, this article isn’t going to go into that debate. For more information, read [Muscle Growth and Fat Loss by Stimulating the B-Agonist System – The Role of Ephedrine, Caffeine, and Aspirin by Michael C. Prevost Ph.D.](http://web.archive.org/web/20151105033501/http://www11.netrition.com:80/eca-article.html)![latte art coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/latte-art-coffee1.Dxhwynr4_179nPe.webp)_Depending upon your diet, this latte may or may not be OK to consume._### The Role of Coffee in Other Diets Before we build or modify our diet, let’s divide the major diets into three groups and examine how they feel about coffee. There are other diets. This overview is not meant to be complete and is intended to serve as a starting point for building a coffee-friendly diet. 1. Low-Fat/High-Carb Diet 2. Isocaloric Diet 3. Low-Carb Diet The low-fat/high-carb diet includes the Pritkin Diet, Dean Ornish’s diet, and countless others. Because coffee is fat-free, this diet is the most coffee-friendly. However, one of the reasons fat-free diets sometimes fail is the belief that removing the fat makes one immune to excess calories. A mocha made with fat-free milk may be without fat, but it is calorically dense and loaded with sugars. If you like sweeter coffee choices, be aware that although the drink may be fat-free, you can jeopardize your diet by consuming too many empty calories. By far, the most popular isocaloric diet is The Zone. An isocaloric diet is one where the calories from fat, protein, and carbs are equal or close to equal. In the case of The Zone, that ratio is 40-30-30 (40% carbs, 30% protein, and 30% fat). Isocaloric diets pay very close attention to the quality of carbohydrates. One of the key elements of this diet is to avoid sugars. A simplistic overview is that avoiding sugars can make the body more effective at burning stored body fat. But does Dr. Sears like coffee? No. Caffeine, even in the absence of calories, can affect blood sugar. More on this later. The low-carb diet made famous by Dr. Atkins restricts carbohydrate intake to the point where the body goes into a state known as _ketosis_. Without carbs, the body becomes very efficient at burning fat. Like the Zone diet, this diet concerns blood sugar and insulin levels; therefore, coffee is forbidden. ### Coffee and Insulin Both The Zone and Dr. Atkins frown on coffee because it can negatively affect blood sugar, affecting the body’s ability to burn fat. How can a zero-calorie beverage affect blood sugar? According to the _Canadian Diabetes Association_: > Drinking caffeine in large amounts as coffee over a short period of time has been shown to raise blood sugar. Caffeine does this by enhancing the effect of two hormones (adrenaline and glucagon). These two hormones release stored sugar from the liver resulting in high blood sugar. And what happens when blood sugar levels are increased? From the Running Planet article _The Glycemic Index – How to use it to Increase Your Energy And Lose Weight_: > This results in large amounts of insulin being dumped into your blood stream. Remember that the job of insulin is to regulate your blood sugar. It needs to do something with the excess glucose (sugar). The easiest thing for insulin to do with it is to store it in your body as fat. Simply put, coffee can affect your blood sugar, which could interfere with your body’s ability to burn fat. These fears of coffee may be over-stated. Even though the authors of these two diets do not favor coffee, there is plenty of anecdotal evidence to suggest that either can be successful despite the continued consumption of coffee. Some non-anecdotal research indicates that exercise helps stabilize blood sugar after ingesting caffeine. Our goal, as defined above, is to get lean while continuing to enjoy coffee. So let’s address the problems coffee could pose to a diet, and find a solution. ### Step 1 – Clean Up Your Coffee Coffee by itself is perfect. It has zero calories, zero carbs, and zero fat. It even has properties that assist with fat loss. Coffee by itself isn’t the problem. Lattes, mochas, iced espresso blended with sugar, whipped cream, ice cream, flavored syrups, alcohol, and caramel are just a few things we add to our coffee. Coffee is derived from the old Arabic word “qahwah” which means “gives strength”. Consuming popular coffee drinks today that are as calorically dense as desserts gives coffee a bad name, and changing the meaning of coffee from _gives strength_ to _gives girth_. To succeed in our diet, we must get back to basics. Regular coffee and straight shots of espresso are fine. As for milk, that depends upon your specific diet. An Atkins diet may allow half and half, whereas a low-fat diet insists on skim milk. If you must use sweeteners, at least try to cut down: go from 2 packets to 1 packet. ### Step 2 – Reduce Your Coffee Intake If too much coffee can affect blood sugar, reducing your caffeine intake only makes sense. However, you don’t want to reduce your coffee intake at the same time you are reducing your caloric intake unless you have super willpower. Fewer calories and less caffeine usually mean an energy reduction, which could lead to binge eating. A smarter move is to reduce your coffee intake for a week before the diet. Once the diet starts, you can slightly increase your coffee levels. Having a clear head is good when you’ve got an empty stomach. Another idea is to space out your coffee intake. Instead of drinking four mugs of coffee back to back, consider spreading those four mugs throughout the day: one at 6 a.m., 10 a.m., 1 p.m., and 5 p.m. Caffeine can be an appetite suppressant as long as you don’t consume too much. Reducing your coffee intake is important, but it can be painful. Cutting back on caffeine can cause headaches and constipation. Accelerated Detox by Rachel Elliot is a good article on reducing caffeine intake. ### Step 3 – Avoid Eating Simple Carbs with Coffee Now, if you’re on a low-carb diet, you’ll want to avoid simple carbs altogether. However, it may not be a wise idea not to eat simple carbs on any diet while drinking your coffee. You know the simple carbs I’m referring to. They would be the bagels, croissants, and scones you see in every coffee shop. Going back to the insulin argument: if caffeine _could_ affect blood sugar negatively, then the last thing you want to do is combine it with something certain to cause an insulin spike. The insulin argument is highly debated. Many do not view lowering insulin as the key to fat loss. For that explanation, search for the article “Insulin…An Undeserved Bad Reputation.” ### Step 4 – Exercise It’s common sense that exercise helps one lose fat on almost any diet. In the words of The Illinois Department of Human Services exercise _…helps the body use insulin more efficiently, and this lowers blood sugar._ If exercising can help us stabilize our blood sugar, then maybe we don’t have to get rid of our coffee to be lean. So, lift some weights, do some aerobic activity, and drink coffee. If you don’t have access to a gym, you can perform body-weight exercises such as the push-up and the Hindu Squat. ### The 3 Diets Revisited People are often more fanatical about their diet choices than their religion. So, be it from me to slam or endorse any particular diet. Each of the four groups mentioned restricts food selection, and the result is often a caloric reduction, which translates to fat loss. What happens behind the curtains may be different, but a combination of healthy eating and exercise has always been the secret to getting lean. Using the above steps, we can maintain our relationship with coffee while dieting. ### Everybody Is Different It is possible to try the above steps with your chosen diet and not succeed. If you must decide between coffee and getting lean, that’s a personal decision you should discuss with your doctor and roaster. In addition to weight training and power walking, this author followed a modified Zone Diet using the above four steps. The result was a body fat reduction from 18% to 9% in 4 months.

# Coffee and Tea Tasting Notes For Beginners [Tea](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/tea/)---by [Michael Allen Smith](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/michael-allen-smith/)![Coffee and Tea Tasting Notes For Beginners](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/coffee-and-tea-tasting-notes-for-beginners/tea-tasting-steep-notes.jpg) When you attend your first coffee or tea tasting, it can seem overwhelming. **How do you take notes describing flavors that are difficult to detect or that you don’t even have the vocabulary to describe?** Something I’ve noticed about all the coffee and tea tastings is that the flavor descriptions communicated to the group influence taste. Others will also detect green peppers in Kenyan coffee if I state that I detect green peppers in Kenyan coffee. If someone announces that they picked up on cocoa notes in a Brazil, I am more likely to also detect them. All this raises the question: What am I really tasting, and do I really like it? Last month, I challenged my tea palate and attended a tasting of black tea. Black tea is my least favorite tea. I’d much rather have an oolong, green, white, or even pu’er tea. I had difficulty describing the tea in the tasting notes at the tasting, so I just started drawing smiley faces to match how much I liked the tea. Later, I followed the same procedure for green tea (see below).![tasting-notes-tea-coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/tasting-notes-tea-coffee1.D5ZGrRo__yG0XN.webp)_Tea Tasting Notes_ At the end of the tasting, I looked over my Smiley Faces and knew I liked the Dragonwell and Sencha. I was neutral on the Jasmine and did not like the Genmaicha. The Matcha started out good and then faded into dislike. This is as simple as it gets and as a customer of tea, it was helpful to me in making a purchase. At a Clover Coffee tasting, I was given a form with different criteria to judge: sweetness, flavor, body, and finish. Using the Smiley Face method, this is what my tasting notes looked like. From each of the two groups, I was able to pick my favorite coffee setting.![clover-coffee-tasting](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/clover-coffee-tasting.CQaq4tAf_2bvGOH.webp)_Clover Coffee Tasting Notes_ Most recently, I did a pu’er tea tasting. Pu’er teas tend to develop richer flavors over multiple steeps. The teas I tasted were better on the 3rd steep than the 1st. To communicate this using Smiley Faces, I modified my scoring system slightly.![tea-tasting-steep-notes](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/tea-tasting-steep-notes.3SuqUoIv_1FLHxw.webp)_Puer Tea Tasting_ Feel free to use and extend the Smiley Face scoring system the next time you attend a coffee or tea tasting. My guess is that this could also work for other drinks and food. Published on April 12, 2010--- #### Michael Allen Smith Michael Allen Smith is both a coffee fanatic and a web developer.

They work entirely in coffee – there are no additives, and it’s 100% pure coffee. Andrew Saur and Angel Sarkela have been painting with coffee for almost a year. At first, they tried several techniques, such as using the coffee bean to sketch with and making pastels out of coffee grounds. Finally, they decided to use the coffee as a watercolor. First, they sketch out an idea, then start brewing a really strong pot of coffee. From there, water is added to gain the subtle tones of brown. Finally, a clear coat of acrylic is added to preserve the art. ### Wildlife![Black bear - Coffee artwork](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/black_bear1.NorPhjMK_Z6rWYy.webp)![polar bear - Coffee artwork](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/polar_bear.Dw-ecfCm_Z1ribcB.webp)![wolf portrait - Coffee artwork](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/wolf_portrait.CfEyy4Nn_ZRTufo.webp)![wolf howling - Coffee artwork](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/wolf_howling.BMxATYKP_1W2i8D.webp)![husky - Coffee artwork](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/bristol.DCMcB7Pt_ZcaTe5.webp)![frog - Coffee artwork](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/frog.DqU_cTzn_P81TC.webp)![loon - Coffee artwork](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/loon.ClQYBh0r_17c7UB.webp)![dragonfly - Coffee artwork](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/dragonfly.zINuvja1_IFCy2.webp) ### Nature![north shore retreat - Coffee artwork](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/north_shore_retreat.jNrW0TUh_ZLGHQk.webp)![waterfall - Coffee artwork](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/waterfall.DAjSfUFQ_Z1AWn61.webp)![witch tree - Coffee artwork](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/witch_tree.BQD9pn3E_E2sXQ.webp)![lighthouse - Coffee artwork](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/lighthouse.ChZtG4z6_Z1lLcea.webp)![lady slipper - Coffee artwork](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/lady_slipper.BVtMr1Cu_kXKt7.webp) ### People![dave matthews - Coffee artwork](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/dave_matthews.bpCiaHZf_Z1Ob50p.webp)![fiddler - Coffee artwork](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/fiddler.CvJBALIj_WcWug.webp)![louis armstrong - Coffee artwork](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/louis_armstrong.leqoPtcw_27l4nr.webp)![john the book binder - Coffee artwork](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/john_the_book_binder.CiYc0XKb_Z1gBAMI.webp) ### Resources [The Coffee Art Corporation](https://ineedcoffee.com/the-coffee-art-corporation/) – INeedCoffee contribution by Ryan L Lewis.

# Coffee and Fitness: Friends or Foes? [Coffee and Health](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/coffee-health/)---by [Matt Pitcher](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/matt-pitcher/)![Coffee and Fitness: Friends or Foes?](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/coffee-and-fitness-friends-or-foes/coffeefitness250x2501.jpg)_Matt Pitcher is a Certified Fitness Trainer (CFT)_ Although I’m a firm believer that the only true and healthy path to sustained energy levels is through the combination of adequate amounts of exercise and rest while eating a balanced amount of real whole foods, sometimes our fast-paced lifestyles don’t make that very practical and require us to use ‘alternative’ means to temporarily boost our energy levels. And, since the readers of this article are coffee lovers, I’m assuming that I won’t be convincing anyone to retire their coffee mug to the pantry forever anytime soon. So, allow me to explain how coffee can impact your health and fitness so that you can utilize your love of coffee in the healthiest way possible.![coffee fitness](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/coffeefitness250x2501.dcW7EZcU_Z1efj5y.webp)_Coffee and Fitness_### Coffee and Health Aside from tasting good (and smelling even better), coffee is believed to have a number of health benefits. You may not need a man in a white coat to tell you that your daily dose of caffeine counteracts fatigue and improves alertness and concentration, but did you know that research suggests coffee can lessen the risk of heart disease, Parkinson’s disease, and gallstones as well as act as a powerful antioxidant? So, is caffeine a health booster that actually tastes good? Well, not necessarily. For every researcher or health expert downing a double latte, there’s another ordering green tea. What are we to think? ### Physiology Coffee gets its kick from caffeine, one of a group of naturally occurring plant-derived compounds called methylxanthines. Caffeine is a drug, pure and simple. It’s addictive. Too much can be toxic. Withdrawal causes side effects such as headaches and dizziness. When ingested, caffeine has a ‘global’ effect, meaning it influences all body tissues, including muscle. > _‘Drinking a cup of coffee stimulates the central nervous system and prompts the adrenal glands to release adrenaline, one of two hormones released in response to stress. Your heart beats faster, glucose is released into the blood stream and you feel energized,’ explains Anthony Haynes, a nutritionist at the Nutrition Clinic in London’s Harley Street. ‘In the short-term you feel revived, but over time this repeated stress response frazzles the adrenal glands, while the liver becomes conditioned to metabolize caffeine more quickly, meaning you’ll need even more cups of coffee to get the same lift.’_### The Dark Side In fact, even if you drink only one cup early in the day, caffeine is still at work in your system hours later. A recent study at the Duke University Medical Center found that levels of adrenalin and noradrenaline remained elevated at night even when subjects had slurped their last cup of coffee at lunchtime – in effect, mimicking 24-hour stress. And that’s not the only charge Haynes levels at the world’s second-favorite drink, after tea. ‘Coffee is an anti-nutrient,’ he says. ‘It hampers the absorption of essential minerals including iron, magnesium, zinc, and potassium, as well as the B vitamins.’ For example, drinking a cup of coffee while eating a hamburger can reduce the amount of iron you absorb by 40 percent, while zinc absorption is reduced if coffee is drunk within an hour after a meal. Even more sinister links have been made between coffee and ill health. Various studies have concluded that avid coffee drinkers are more at risk of miscarriage and birth defects, osteoporosis, arthritis, and heart disease. So, is our daily cup doing more harm than good? ### The Jury is Still Out > _‘The findings thus far on coffee intake and health are inconsistent,’ says Dr. Wendy Doyle from the British Dietetic Association. ‘In my mind, the evidence against coffee drinking is poor, unless you’re talking about an exceptionally high consumption. In moderation, coffee doesn’t appear to cause health problems.’_ This was the same conclusion as the authors of the [Nurses’ Health Study](https://www.nurseshealthstudy.org/), an epic 25-year study of disease and women’s health and lifestyle habits. They reported that _drinking coffee in moderation appears to have few if any, adverse consequences._ The study also failed to find evidence to support the link between coffee and increased risk of heart disease and cancer, as well as any difference in the risk of heart disease among women who drank six cups a day compared to those who totally abstained. But experts like Anthony Haynes are highly skeptical about many of the recent positive findings. And in spite of unfounded evidence on the negative effects of coffee, the Nurses’ Health Study did note that coffee’s effect on calcium absorption could make excessive caffeine intake a bad idea for post-menopausal women at risk of osteoporosis. In fact, nutritionist and best-selling author, Carol Simontacchi has stated that caffeine ‘bleaches’ the bones of calcium over time. Dr. Doyle agrees that the evidence relating to a high caffeine intake and miscarriage is worrying. ‘It’s wise to keep caffeine from coffee and other sources – such as tea, energy drinks and chocolate – to a minimum if you’re pregnant,’ she says. So, despite being one of the most researched beverages around, no one has come up with a definitive ‘yes’ or ‘no’ answer to the question of coffee and health. Dr. Doyle and Anthony Haynes agree on one thing, however. Smoking, lack of exercise, and excess alcohol are more serious issues than having a few cups of coffee. ‘A daily cup isn’t going to do you much harm, but if you want optimum energy and health, you’ll be better off without it,’ says Haynes. While Haynes might be adamant about the detrimental effects of coffee, the rest of the jury is still out – most likely getting a nice, frothy cappuccino. ### Coffee and Exercise So, having said all this, can coffee improve your fitness? It does seem that the ingestion of caffeine can enhance exercise and sports performance, and this area of research has produced quite compelling results. In a landmark study by American doctor Dave Costill in the 1970s, a group of cyclists were able to ride for 21 minutes longer post-caffeine ingestion. In fact, caffeine’s efficacy as a performance-enhancing drug has led the International Olympic Committee to consider urinary levels of caffeine exceeding 12 micrograms/ml as worthy of a ban. You’d have to knock back eight cups of coffee to achieve such a target, however. Assuming you’re not competing at the top level, a strong cup of coffee an hour before that fun run or charity bike ride might just help you through. Even if it isn’t physiologically easier, studies have shown that people perceive their effort to be less intense after caffeine ingestion. In other words, you’re trying as hard, but you don’t feel as if you are. However, caffeine can also dehydrate you, so don’t overdo it, and be sure to drink water regularly during your workouts. So, these previous studies show that caffeine can boost your endurance, particularly during exercise lasting between thirty minutes and two hours. Because of its high caffeine content, many people drink coffee in the belief that it has the same effect. Unfortunately, it doesn’t, according to a recent study. A Canadian research team compared the effects of coffee and caffeine on run time to exhaustion. A group of nine men took part in five trials. Sixty minutes before each run, the men took one of the following. - Placebo (a “dummy” supplement). - Caffeine capsules. - De-caffeinated coffee. - De-caffeinated coffee with caffeine added. - Regular coffee. Performance times were up to 10 minutes longer in subjects using the caffeine capsules. There were no differences in run times among the other trials. These results are somewhat surprising, especially when you consider that caffeine absorption was similar during all three caffeine trials. The only explanation is that something in the coffee interferes with the effects of caffeine. This isn’t surprising, especially when you consider there are hundreds of compounds dissolved when coffee beans are roasted, ground, and extracted in hot water. In fact, when one of these compounds was injected into rats, it actually slowed heart rate and lowered blood pressure. The bottom line, then, is that if you plan to use caffeine to boost your exercise routines (particularly your endurance times), pure caffeine (such as in the form of capsules) might prove to be more beneficial than coffee. ### Conclusion Clearly, coffee has some health benefits but also very real risks, and its role in improving fitness levels is questionable. So, in light of these facts, I highly recommend being balanced in your approach to coffee ingestion as it relates to your health and fitness. One great way to achieve that balance is to follow the guidelines of the coffee diet and to enjoy your coffee in moderation while following a proper exercise routine. And, if you aren’t sure how to best do that, consult a clinically certified nutritionist and/or fitness expert. After all, the longer we live, the longer we can enjoy coffee!

It became an even bigger part of his life when he launched _Daily Shot of Coffee_ in March 2009. A former New Yorker who now lives in the Tampa, Fla. area, Crimmins manages blogs and websites professionally. On the eve of the first game of the baseball postseason, Crimmins, a New York Yankees fan, graciously agreed to do an interview about his blogging approach with yours truly, a Boston Red Sox fan. (He even refrained from talking trash after the Yankees advanced to the American League Championship Series, while the Red Sox were eliminated before I managed to complete this piece.)![Mike Crimmins](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/mike_crimmins1.Cs5g5zxk_250Uya.webp)_Mike Crimmins, Daily Shot of Coffee creator_**Nourishing Routines** Crimmins’s day off from the Daily Shot earlier this year was memorable because it was an exception. He gave his readers advance warning that there would be no post on that day, but it didn’t feel quite right. “I took the night off, and it felt weird not to do a post,” he said. Since he launched the _Daily Shot of Coffee_, Crimmins has been a model of consistency. He posts seven days a week, and the ritual helps spur his writing process. Each day, he reviews other coffee blogs before work. At 7 p.m. he begins writing, a process that usually takes about an hour. “I feel the need to post every day. I like the fact that I have the daily routine,” Crimmins said. “Even days when I’m feeling stuck, I know I’m going to do a post.” Crimmins is rarely stuck, though. He has a calendar on which he fills future days with post ideas. “I’m always three or four weeks ahead with things I want to post about,” Crimmins said. On weekends, Crimmins posts but takes it a bit easier. Saturday posts are usually brief, and on Sundays, he does Fresh Brews, a compilation of coffee-related news stories. “That gives me a little bit of a break from the routine,” he said. ### Staying Humble and Grounded Crimmins’ approach on Daily Shot is to keep elitism to a minimum — he doesn’t profess to be a connoisseur. “I think I have my own point of view,” Crimmins said. “I’ve always considered myself an average coffee drinker.” On the Daily Shot’s inaugural post, Crimmins admitted a fondness for Starbucks and Dunkin’ Donuts coffee, although the latter has since fallen out of favor with him. One thing is non-negotiable, though — he’ll only brew coffee that’s freshly ground from whole beans. And after reviewing so many coffees on Daily Shot, the bar is inevitably rising. “I’ve tried some amazing coffee since I started,” Crimmins said. Even after experiencing 100% Kona, though, he hasn’t crossed over into SnobLand. “[I’ll still drink] grocery store and gas station coffee to keep that balance,” he said. ### Admirable and Accessible Crimmins aims to keep Daily Shot accessible in tone, and he admires bloggers who are like-minded. He describes Gary Vaynerchuk’s video blog on _Wine Library TV_ and Jason on _Coffee Cup News_ as major influences. “His video reviews are very down-to-earth and easy for me to watch,” Crimmins said. ” His reviews helped me grasp more of what I was tasting.” Now Crimmins too does multimedia reviews of the coffees he tastes, with both written and video reviews being Daily Shot staples. He looks forward to his daily posting routine and knew right after launching the site that he was in this for the long haul. “I think the first week I wrote about coffee, I knew it was going to be something I wanted to do for a long time.” UPDATE 2014: Daily Shot of Coffee is no longer online.

# Coffee Blending Strategies [Roasting Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/roasting-coffee/)---by [Stefanie Spencer](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/stefanie-spencer/)![Coffee Blending Strategies](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/coffee-blending-strategies/espresso-epic-blend.jpg) Have you ever noticed that on the supermarket shelves most of what you can buy are coffee blends? If single-origin estate coffees are so fabulous, why would you want a blend? There are many reasons for creating blends, but the two main ones are to make a blend that tastes better than any of its parts individually (the whole is greater than the sum of the parts) or for large roasters to save money by “watering down” the expensive coffee with cheaper, inferior beans. Assuming you are the coffee connoisseur that is looking for excellence in quality, let me explain the art of blending by using a perfume analogy. When perfumers (affectionately called a “Nez” or Nose) design a fragrance, they generally think of the scent as having three notes, a high, middle, and low. - The high note is made of fragrances that are the first impression. They are bright and assertive scents, like citrus and ginger, but evaporate quickly. - Then the middle notes shine, which are more mellow and create the “heart” of the perfume, such as rose or lavender. - Lastly, as the middle gradually fades, the low notes show through, like musk or plant resin. These are what bring depth and solidness to the perfume and act as fixatives to cause the entire fragrance to last longer.![Epic Espresso Blend](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/espresso-epic-blend.0dUlD-0i_3kRF9.webp)_Epic Espresso from 49th Parallel_ Just like perfume, coffee has different notes that can be combined to create a great overall experience. In the Voice, April 2008, I discussed how the qualities of the coffee are defined, such as aroma, taste, body, acidity, and aftertaste. One coffee might be too assertive in a category to be considered great by itself, but it might be that perfect highlight in a blend. Also, the various coffees in the blend can be roasted to different degrees, allowing each one to shine with its best qualities. The high notes in coffee would be the bright, acidic, floral, citrus, or cinnamon-type flavors and aromas. Some types of coffee are strong in these high notes by themselves and overpowering, but they work great in a blend. What is great about blending your own coffee is that the possibilities are endless; experiment to find the coffee flavors that you prefer. - For a good quality Central American (Guatemala, Panama), Mexican, Yemeni, or Ethiopian coffee, use 25% for the blend. - The middle note, or the body, should make up 50% of the blend. The body is the oil content of the coffee determined by its mouthfeel. The good ones to try would be Brazil or Colombian. - Lastly, the low note would be the musky, chocolate, nutty, earthy, caramel, or ashy type flavors that make up the remaining 25% of the blend. For more body and sweetness, use an Indonesian like a Sulawesi or a premium Sumatra. For a musty, earthy flavor, try a Monsooned Malabar from India. An aged Sumatra will also provide a unique flavor. Again, the possibilities are endless. Back in the supermarket, you might also notice ones like breakfast blends, which are made up of a higher percentage of bright, acidic coffees, or Italian roast blends, which are made up of a dark roasted body with earthy notes and hardly any brightness. Also, you can squeeze the coffee bag gently and the scent should tell you whether it is a dark roast or a bright, floral blend. ### Resources [Coffee Blending For the Home Roaster](https://ineedcoffee.com/coffee-blending-for-the-home-roaster/) – Tips on creating blends for the home coffee roaster.

# Coffee Blending For the Home Roaster [Roasting Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/roasting-coffee/)---by [Michael Allen Smith](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/michael-allen-smith/)![Coffee Blending For the Home Roaster](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/coffee-blending-for-the-home-roaster/weigh-coffee-beans1.jpg) Shortly after you start home-roasting coffee, you’ll encounter a near-empty bag of coffee. You’ll look at it and decide it’s too little for a single batch. At this point, you can either buy more coffee from that same crop, throw it away, or experiment with blending. Blending can be divided into two camps: blending for espresso and blending for non-espresso (regular coffee). My experience with blending has taught me that coffee blending is far easier and more forgiving than blending for espresso. Building an espresso blend will likely take many attempts before you get your desired flavor profile. Most of my regular coffee blends were successful on the first try. Ultimately, espresso blending is a separate topic. This article will cover blending for regular coffee. ### Home Roasters Are Different From Commercial Roasters Home coffee roasters face different challenges than commercial coffee roasters. They roast less coffee, roast less frequently, and, with rare exceptions, offer far less control over the temperature profile throughout the roast, especially when roasting outdoors. I have found that coffee blending can mask and overcome some problems home roasters experience. Now that I’ve been home coffee roasting and blending for ten years, I’ve developed a set of patterns that I’ve used to build coffee blends. Since a home roaster always has different amounts of beans, I tend not to use fixed recipes. I’ve found that fixed recipes work better for espresso. Coffee blending is like art class in school – you see what materials are available in the supply closet and then do your best with what you have.![weigh coffee beans](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/weigh-coffee-beans.DyxIv-QZ_Z2oPBg0.webp)_Weight and measure your coffee blend._### Just a Pinch Blend Often, a blend is forced when you find yourself just an ounce or two short of completing your roast. You didn’t intend on blending, but you ran out of beans. After noticing many commercial roasters were using Guatemalan coffee in their blends, I started keeping a bag handy. I’ve noticed that Guatemalans never try to dominate the flavor of the beans they blend with. Instead, they highlight the flavor of the other crops in the blend. Thus, my advice for home coffee roasters is to always have some Guatemalan handy. ### Checkerboard Blend (2 Crops) Anyone who has roasted multiple roasts back-to-back has noticed a trend: the machine gets hotter, and each subsequent roast gets faster. Depending upon what you use to roast and the ambient temperature, you might find the first roast was too slow and the second roast was too fast. Neither batch will taste great on its own, but blended together, they have greater flavor. The “Checkerboard Blend” can be done in two manners. 1. Same Crop. Find a forgiving bean that tastes good, roasted darker and lighter. Take the first roast lighter and the second roast darker. Recommended beans: Brazil, Colombia, Sumatra. 2. Two Crops. The same as above, but this time, pick your flavor bean first and the body bean for the second roast. Recommended flavor beans: East Africa (all) and Central America (all). Recommended body beans: Brazil, Colombia, and Sumatra. ### Three-Crop Blend Many of the great blends I’ve tried had used three different crops. My pattern for this blend is to fill three roles: body, bright flavor, and subtle flavor. Three beans, three roasts. 1. Bright Flavor (light roast): East Africa (Ethiopia, Kenya, Rwanda) 2. Subtle Flavor (medium roast): Central America (Panama, Costa Rica, Guatemala, Honduras) 3. Body (darker roast): Brazil. Colombia, Sumatra Keep the three roasts in three different containers. Now, experiment with brewing in a [press pot](https://ineedcoffee.com/press-pot-tutorial/) with various ratios. This will enable home roasters to quickly determine what flavors to include and those to change. ### Faking Freshness Blend Commercial roasters can average the expected intake of all their customers and clients and estimate how much to roast without running out. They can even afford to have some waste; if they notice they will run out sooner, they can do an emergency roast. Home coffee roasters can have wildly varying coffee intake and schedules that prevent always having the optimal amount of coffee handy. Although roasting too little is a problem blending can’t correct, I’ve discovered a hack that corrects over-roasting. Let us say you still have some coffee starting to lose its freshness, but you don’t want to throw it out yet. I’ve been known to roast a single batch of either the same bean or Guatemalan coffee and add it to the older coffee. I call it “punching up” the blend. Sophisticated palates can detect something is off, but most won’t. Blending older coffee with a small amount of 1-day-old coffee can extend the overall blend by a few more days. I’m sure there are doubters, but I’ve had years of success doing this trick with many people. ### The 7-Day Pre-Blending Trick I saved the best tip for last. The biggest problem with constructing blends is that different beans roast at different rates. Some are faster and some are slower. So you either under-roast some or over-roast others. Since commercial roasters work with larger volumes, they have the freedom to roast each component of the blend separately to peak and then post blend. We home roasters can’t do that or we end up roasting way too much coffee or constructing blends with just a few equally portioned components. The solution I learned is to pre-blend the green beans and then let them sit for a week. This will even out the moisture levels, and the beans will roast at the same speed. This single tip has greatly increased the quality of my home-roasted blends, especially espresso, where a single component may only represent 5% of the blend. This especially works well when one of the beans is robusta. However, it does not work when mixing decaf with regular coffee beans. ### When Not to Blend If I buy a nice single-origin or an island coffee, I will not use it in a blend. Special coffees deserve special attention and shouldn’t be used in regular coffee blends. Blending the expensive special stuff is like pouring cola over a single malt scotch. ### Conclusion The blending needs of the home coffee roaster are less about designing perfect recipes than establishing patterns for working with limited supplies. I hope my fellow home roasters learned a trick or two to incorporate into their blends.

# Coffee and the Decaffeination Process [Coffee and Health](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/coffee-health/)---by [Ryan Jacobs](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/ryan-jacobs/)![Coffee and the Decaffeination Process](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/coffee-and-the-decaffeination-process/decaf-coffee-comic1.jpg) Drinking decaffeinated coffee is, in theory, a way of enjoying the beverage while eliminating the caffeine and preserving the taste. While improvements have been made to the processes, the taste of caffeinated coffee is not preserved perfectly, process completely eliminates all of the caffeine. To understand decaffeination processes completely, one must consider the function of the caffeine molecule, with specific attention to taste. The caffeine molecule is a bitter alkaloid, so it contributes to acidity as well as the bitter properties of coffee. Removing this molecule will alter those taste factors. Other flavor compounds are also diminished or removed in the decaffeination process. This means that the taste of decaffeinated coffee is usually inferior to that of caffeinated coffee.![decaf coffee comic ](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/decaf-coffee-comic1.Cwhp9Szr_1RGtyj.webp)_Inanimate Objects – Decaf Coffee Comic by [Todd Zapoli](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/todd-zapoli/)_### Labeling Practices It is important to note that the Food and Drug Administration of the United States has no regulatory authority over coffee. Consequently, “decaffeinated” coffee can vary wildly. A product may contain between 2 and 13 milligrams of caffeine and still be labeled “decaffeinated”. Several studies have shown that store-bought decaf has a higher caffeine ratio, so you should probably purchase your decaffeinated coffee beans from a gourmet roaster. Furthermore, random samplings of brewed coffee suggest that – surprise – human error exists so that sometimes that cup of decaf is actually just regular coffee in an orange-handled pot. If you are extremely concerned about caffeine or sensitive to its effect, you should buy the beans from a reputable source and brew the coffee yourself. ### Two Types of Decaf Processes There are two types of decaffeination processes. The first is called the **Swiss Water Process** method. Decaf coffee made with this method can be found at most gourmet coffee shops and organic food grocery stores. The other decaffeination processes use some sort of **chemical solvent**. In this article, I’ll explain the essential aspects of the chemical removal process then I’ll discuss a specific variation of the chemical process termed the **Super Critical Carbon Dioxide** method. In all of the decaffeination processes, the green coffee beans begin the journey by being steamed and/or soaked in water. This makes the caffeine soluble and primed for extraction. ### The Swiss Water Process Method The Swiss Water Process is popular among its advocates because it does not use chemicals. Instead, a green coffee extract is used. This green coffee extract is almost caffeine-free. Due to chemical solubility laws, the caffeine will move from an area of higher concentration (the bean itself) to an area of lower concentration (the extract). Since the extract contains essential oils and other valuable components of the bean, caffeine finds its way into the extract and leaves behind the desirable components of the coffee. Done properly, this organic method successfully removes **94 – 96%** of the caffeine while it retains more of the flavor compounds present in the essential oils than the chemical methods. Keep in mind that Swiss Water Process coffee beans are generally more expensive than beans treated with a chemical solvent. This is due to the fact that Swiss Water Processing almost always accompanies high-quality arabica beans, while chemical processes are used on both arabica and robusta beans. ### The Chemical Solvent Method The chemical solvent method is the most commonly used method for removing caffeine from coffee. Chemical methods remove the caffeine better than the Swiss Water Process method because the solvents used can target caffeine most evenly and effectively. Common solvents include methylene chloride, ethyl acetate, and highly pressurized carbon dioxide. After the green beans are moistened, they are immersed in the solvent. After the solvent performs its action, the beans are rinsed with water. After the beans have been rinsed, they are steamed. Residual solvents evaporate in the steam. The rinsing and evaporation systems collect the solvent for recycling and re-use. Any remaining solvent will be burned off in the roasting process. The chemical caffeine method will remove **96 – 98%** of caffeine. ### The Supercritical Carbon Dioxide Method The Supercritical Carbon Dioxide method is a chemical method that is somewhat dissimilar to the other chemical methods; therefore it deserves special attention. This method uses carbon dioxide at 250 – 300 times the normal atmospheric pressure. Carbon dioxide in this form looks like a liquid in terms of density, but it has the viscosity of a gas. It is a very effective solvent at high pressures. When the coffee beans are exposed to the solvent, the caffeine migrates to the solvent. When the caffeine removal is complete, the now caffeine-rich carbon dioxide is passed through either an activated charcoal bed or a bath of water to absorb the caffeine for re-use. Like other chemical methods, the Supercritical Carbon Dioxide method removes **96 – 98%** of the caffeine. Carbon dioxide is inexpensive to obtain and non-toxic. ### Like an Elvis song One might compare a naturally mellow (low acidity) cup of caffeinated coffee with a decaffeinated version of a high-acidity coffee. If you prefer a coffee known for bitterness or acidity in the caffeinated version, the coffee in a decaffeinated state will taste “flat”. At the same time, the other characteristics of that coffee will be brighter since they aren’t masked by so much bitterness or acidity. It is kind of like an Elvis Presley song. Often, brilliant bass lines aren’t noticed until the vocal track has been removed. In these moments, the full complexity of the song is realized. On the flip side, removing the vocals could reveal an uninteresting tune that is better in a complete state. Until a method is developed that completely eliminates caffeine while preserving other flavor constituents of coffee, we will have to tolerate these imperfect methods. The best thing to do is to try several different brands of decaffeinated coffee until you settle on the one or two that taste the best and have the least amount of caffeine._Note: The following addendum on the decaffeination process was written by Donald N. Schoenholt of Gillies Coffee Co._> The original article may leave the impression that _Swiss Water_ is a process generally available from many decaffeinator sources when in fact it is the patented and branded product of _Kraft_, manufactured in their Nabob plant in Vancouver, BC. No other decaffeinated product is made the same way, nor is any other product _Swiss Water_ only theirs. > Water is a chemical, H2O. It is no more or less a chemical than Carbon Dioxide, CO2. They are both chemicals and they both are found in nature, and decaffeinated coffee made from either can be called _natural_. This is not clear in the article, as the _Nabob_ item is listed separately and CO2 is listed with _chemical_ decaffeination. By the way, the only CO2 decaf available to specialty roasters in the US is that made by _Hermsen_ in Germany and imported by _Excelco Trading LLP_, New York. > Ethyl Acetate can be found in nature, or can be synthetically produced. It too is a chemical compound and may, when used to decaffeinate, be labeled _natural_ should it be from natural sources. The problem is that everybody labels this decaf **natural** and there is almost no way of knowing whether the source of the solvent is natural or synthetic. > Methylene Chloride is a synthetic chemical solvent. It is not naturally found but must be created by chlorinating methane gas. It sounds terrible but it makes very good tasting decaf.

# Coffee and Your Health [Coffee and Health](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/coffee-health/)---by [Stefanie Spencer](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/stefanie-spencer/)![Coffee and Your Health](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/coffee-and-your-health/table-of-coffee-cups1.jpg) You would be hard-pressed to find another beverage besides coffee with more controversial health benefits or concerns. With each passing year, coffee seems to be hailed as either medicine or poison, but this year, the findings seem to have been positive. Let’s take a look at a few recent conclusions. ### Coffee May Prevent and Treat Alzheimer’s In a study on mice, researchers gave them the equivalent of 3-5 cups of strong coffee and found that after two months, the subjects’ memory greatly improved. This may be because the caffeine reduces inflammation in the brain, which would improve memory, or because they had 50% less amyloid-beta protein in their brains. Testing the memory of a mouse—what an interesting job. As for studies on humans, the lead researcher on the project, Miia Kivipelto, a professor at the University of Kuopio in Finland and the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, said, “Middle-aged people who drank between three and five cups of coffee a day lowered their risk of developing dementia and Alzheimer’s disease by between 60 and 65 percent later in life.” She also said it remained unclear exactly how moderate coffee drinking helped delay or avoid the onset of dementia but pointed out that coffee contains strong antioxidants, which are known to counter Alzheimer’s.![Coffee Cups](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/table-of-coffee-cups1.BqEBpdpz_1xsMXS.webp)_Coffee Cups_### Coffee May Help Diabetics Previous studies have affirmed that high consumption of coffee may lower the risk for type 2 diabetes, and now another study on 15 overweight men was performed, focusing on two specific compounds found in coffee: chlorogenic acid and trigonelline. The researchers examined the effects on both glucose and insulin concentrations and found a significant reduction in glucose and insulin 15 minutes after the oral glucose tolerance test, a two-hour procedure commonly used to diagnose diabetes. They believe that these specific compounds contribute to the overall beneficial effect of coffee on the development of type 2 diabetes. ### Caffeine Used to Fight Skin Cancer Scientists now believe that both drinking caffeine and using sunscreens or after-sun creams containing caffeine may improve sun-damaged skin and reduce the risk of developing non-melanoma skin cancer. In a 2007 study, it was shown that drinking caffeinated coffee reduced the risk of developing non-melanoma skin cancer by 5% for each cup consumed per day. Now, researchers have shown that caffeine applied topically to the skin effectively protects skin cells after exposure to UV radiation. The reasoning behind it is believed to be that caffeine causes apoptosis, the programmed death of precancerous cells. In one study, after exposing hairless mice to UV radiation, they found that topical applications of caffeine decreased the number of nonmalignant skin tumors by 44% and malignant skin tumors by 72%. It increased the apoptosis of nonmalignant skin tumors by 87% and squamous cell carcinomas by 92%, and there was no effect on the non-tumor areas of the skin. This should be good news for those of us living in Arizona! ### Coffee Helps Hepatitis C Patients In an observational study, it was found that patients with a hepatitis C virus infection who drank three cups or more of coffee per day appeared to be less likely to suffer from the progression of liver damage caused by the disease. Those who drank three or more cups of coffee per day had livers that were much healthier than the other participants. At the 13-month follow-up, outcome rates continued to decrease more for those who consumed three or more cups per day than those who drank little or no coffee, leading researchers to claim that “coffee consumption may slow the progression of fibrotic liver disease” (the result of the liver forming excessive fibrous connective tissue). ### References [Coffee may prevent, treat Alzheimer’s](https://web.archive.org/web/20210617082754/https://www.healthcentral.com/article/caffeine-may-prevent-alzheimers-by-halting-tau-protein-growth) – CBS News story on Health Central.

# Coffee Beef Stew Recipe [Recipes](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/coffee-recipes/)---by [J.B. Bulharowski](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/j-b-bulharowski/)![Coffee Beef Stew Recipe](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/coffee-beef-stew-recipe/coffee-beef-stew-recipe.jpg) When it comes to COFFEE, especially any leftover nectar, I refuse to waste it. With a culinary degree under my belt, inspiration reigns supreme. I’ve found interesting uses for that dribble of dark stuff left-over in my brew pot. To this day, I seldom throw out any leftover coffee. I usually pour it into a small glass jar and store it in the fridge. Once when I was making a savory beef stew, I sheepishly threw in that leftover  ¼ – ½ cup coffee. Wow, what a surprise, in lieu of super homemade beef stock, that little bit of coffee added a nice deep richness to my tasty stew, the coffee flavor was unidentifiable. Now, I wouldn’t make beef stew without it. ## Recipe: Coffee Beef Stew**Summary**: _Recipe to make a beef stew with a coffee-inspired broth._#### Ingredients - 2 Lbs. Beef Chuck, Cut Into 1 1/2 inch Cubes - 1 Teaspoon Sugar - 1/2 Teaspoon Peppercorns (Whole) - 2 Tablespoons Fat (or Mix Of Fat & Butter), Heated Almost To Smoking - 1/2 Teaspoon Paprika Dash Allspice Or Cloves 2 Cups Boiling Water, Or 1/2 water and strong leftover coffee or stock - 1/2 Lb. Carrots, Cut into 1/2 inch pieces - 2 Potatoes, Cut into 1/2 inch pieces - 1 Tablespoon Lemon Juice (Optional) - 1 Each Turnip, Parsnip, Rutabaga, Cut into 1/2 inch pieces - 1 Teaspoon Worcestershire Sauce - 2 Celery Stalks, Cut into 1/2 inch pieces - 1 Tablespoon Soy Sauce - 1 Sprig Thyme, Fresh If Possible - 1 Clove of Garlic, Sliced - 1 Handful Fresh Parsley - 1 Medium Onion, Sliced In Half Moons - **Dumplings: (Optional)**- 1-2 Bay Leaves - 2 Cups Biscuit Mix - 1 Tablespoon Salt, Seasoned Type - 2/3 Cups Milk![coffee beef stew](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/coffee-beef-stew.B5MV0Cmu_Z2qWPyK.webp)_Coffee Beef Stew_#### Instructions 1. To season and flour the meat, put the beef and a little seasoned flour in a paper sack or plastic bag; shake until coated in batches, and the job is done! Continue with the recipe. There is one suggestion here: if you opt to cook this in a crockpot rather than on the stovetop, take the time to brown the meat carefully for the reason cited in the next sentence. Brown meat on all sides is in hot fat, turning often and letting a nice fond develop. Fond is the brown bits accumulated on the bottom of a crockpot during the browning process. The liquid is then added to “deglaze” the pan and form a concentrated flavoring. This step enhances the formulation of a great, complex, flavorful final product. 2. Add water (liquid of your choice, coffee water, stock, to measure 4 cups), lemon juice, Worcestershire sauce, garlic, sliced onion, bay leaves, and seasonings. Cover and simmer, do not boil, for two (2) hours, stirring occasionally to keep the mix from sticking. Remove bay leaves, peppercorns, and any other whole seasonings you’ve included. Add carrots and onions. If carrots are large, halve or quarter. Cubed potatoes may also be added. Cover and cook 30 minutes longer or until vegetables are tender. Remove meat and veggies, and thicken the liquid for gravy, if desired. Garnish with some chopped parsley. 3. Gravy: Skim most of the fat from the stew liquid. For 3 cups of liquid, put 1 cup of water in a shaker or mason jar with a top, and add 1 cup A.P. flour, shaking until smooth. Add the flour mixture slowly to the meat stock, stirring constantly until gravy bubbles all over. Cook about 5 minutes more, stirring often. Pour over meat and vegetables.

# Coffee Can Help You Land a Job, Get a Date, and Win a Race [Coffee and Health](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/coffee-health/)---by [Joel Sussman](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/joel-sussman/) Coffee is a fascinating beverage because it is so interwoven into our culture, our lifestyles, and our ability to achieve our potential as human beings. Now, wait a minute! Isn’t that last claim taking the coffee debate a little too far: coffee as an elixir for human potential? Well, coffee, in and of itself, is not going to help you climb the corporate ladder, write a best-selling novel, or reel in a new client, but for many people, it definitely can help. ### Does Coffee Really Give You a Competitive Advantage? Everyone reacts differently to caffeine, and some people should just plain stay away from it. However, for those people whose performance is enhanced by a couple of cups of java, it literally can make the difference between success and failure. Two common scenarios in which coffee can help are in a job interview or a sales presentation. In either situation, your prospective employer or customer is going to be judging you on the basis of enthusiasm, energy level, and reaction time. If you come across as remotely lethargic, slow thinking, or lackluster, you might be perceived as someone who lacks confidence or doesn’t genuinely believe in themselves or their products or services. That can be a deal killer. In a job interview, it’s especially important to have that extra edge because the interviewer will be noticing (to quote Sting) “every breath you take…every move you make”. Interviewers are as ready to disqualify you as they are to invite you back for the next round. Even though the interviewer may not be consciously aware of it, they’re noticing every little nuance of your demeanor-from your posture to the length of time you pause before responding to a question. When you have the advantage of a couple of cups of joe in your system, your ability to pay attention, think more clearly, and respond intelligently can be enhanced. You still need to be qualified for the job, of course, but in most hiring situations, there’s more than one qualified applicant. Very often, it’s the candidate who’s perceived as sharper, enthusiastic, and more energetic who makes the final cut.![espresso red saucer](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/espresso-red-saucer.CtfBbcW7_d3Jic.webp)_Competitive Advantage?_ An article on the topic of “interview demeanor” posted on the Web site of a Salt Lake City TV station (ABC 4) seems to bear this out. According to employer surveys, demeanor is the most influential factor in the hiring decision. The article also offers some specifics on effective demeanor: “During the interview, it’s vital to show enthusiasm. Be responsive, attentive, and remember to smile.” The news feature does caution the reader against being fidgety, which, incidentally, can be a side effect of drinking too much coffee. Caffeine can make you appear jittery, nervous, and overbearing, so, as in all things, moderation and knowing your own personal limits are the keys. Since perception is everything, though, a moderate amount of coffee consumption can make us appear smarter, responsive, and more “on the ball”. Imagine trying to make it through college without a cup or two of coffee every day. How would we pull those grueling all-nighters, get ourselves to those early-morning classes, or make incisive comments in class-especially when we’re trying to impress an attractive classmate you’d like to ask out? Since people pick up on subtleties in your behavior, coffee can help give you that extra “spark” that can make you a little more animated and exciting. The use of a moderate amount of caffeine to enhance athletic performance is a controversial issue because, although it doesn’t violate any formal rules or standards, some in the athletic community think it’s unnatural or provides an unfair advantage. Depending on which study you read, however, caffeine can improve an athlete’s performance by 3-5% or more. According to a New York Times article from March 25th, 2009, performance improvement in controlled laboratory settings can be as much as 20% to 25%. The article, entitled “It’s Time to Make a Coffee Run” goes on to say that in the real world, performance improvement fueled by a couple of cups of coffee may only average about 5 percent–which is still significant if you want to achieve your personal best or win a race. On the other hand, caffeine can potentially cause a racing heart, jitters, and elevated blood pressure, so there can be undesirable side effects. The bottom line is: that everyone needs to do what’s right for their own body, their goals, and their moral compass. ### Resources Interview demeanor – Interview tips from ABC 4 in Salt Lake City. _The story has been removed from the website._[It’s Time to Make a Coffee Run](https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/26/health/nutrition/26best.html?_r=1) – NY Times article By Gina Kolata.

# Coffee Candy Review [Cafe Culture](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/cafe-culture/)---by [Rachel Elliot](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/rachel-elliot/)![Coffee Candy Review](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/coffee-candy-review/pocket150x1781.jpg)_**2017 UPDATE:** We have completely updated this article. Check out [A Coffee Drinker’s Guide to Coffee Candies](https://ineedcoffee.com/coffee-drinkers-guide-coffee-candies/)._  As a coffee fanatic, I’ve often sought ways to extend my love of coffee and simultaneously placate my sweet tooth. So, I’ve taken to eating coffee-flavored candy. It is worth noting that there is no such thing as a coffee flavoring that is completely man-made. All coffee flavoring is derived from coffee because the taste of coffee is just too complex to be replicated accurately. But just because it is derived from real coffee **does not** mean that all coffee candy is created equal. ### Pocket Coffee This candy starts with a caramelized sugar pocket for a sweet espresso liquid. The caramelized sugar is coated with European milk chocolate. The manufacturer (Fererro) claims that eating three pieces is equivalent to a shot of espresso, and I have to admit that I got a buzz off of the candy. I brought it to work to share with co-workers. They loved it and asked for more.![Pocket Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/pocket150x1781.CgggYmeC_Z15uaoI.webp)_Review for Pocket Coffee: Fantastic!_### Coffee Rio This candy’s consistency is similar to chewy caramel. It sticks to your molars and tastes like a cup of coffee with lots of cream and sugar. You can purchase it by the bag at specialty grocery stores.![Coffee Rio](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/rio150x127.kH_VOKci_yMidS.webp)_Review for Coffee Rio: Very Good_### Rademaker’s Hopjes This is a little hard candy from Holland. It’s pretty tasty. The coffee flavor is evenly distributed throughout the candy and tastes a little like a Frappuccino. Getting this candy can be a little tricky. I stumbled upon it at a local coffee shop.![Hopjes](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/hopjes150x194.BB-wUBrV_12WY2C.webp)_Review for Rademaker’s Hopjes: Good_### Brach’s Coffee Candy This hard candy smells like coffee and is colored like a cup of weak coffee, but it tastes nothing like coffee. It’s so gross that I spit it out before finishing the piece. You can find it at your local supermarket in Brach’s bulk candy display.![brach 5](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/brach150x113.C_xCJ9Y5_Z1nAYlr.webp)_Review for Brach’s Coffee Candy: Yucky_### Rocket Chocolate This candy is marketed “for adults only” and claims to boost energy like a cup of coffee. It has a gunk-filled center surrounded by low-grade chocolate. It’s lousy; stay away from this brand. Trust me, you don’t want to try this candy, so locating it shouldn’t be a concern.![Rocket Chocolate](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/rocket150x193.CgLrMh6u_1vnvpB.webp)_Review for Rocket Chocolate: Horrible_### Resources [A Coffee Drinker’s Guide to Coffee Candies](https://ineedcoffee.com/coffee-drinkers-guide-coffee-candies/) – Our updated guide to Coffee Candies.

# Coffee on Canvas – Making Art With Coffee [Cafe Culture](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/cafe-culture/)---by [Jon Norquist](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/jon-norquist/)![Coffee on Canvas – Making Art With Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/coffee-canvas-making-art-coffee/coffee-on-canvas.jpg)_Coffee on Canvas is a project by Jon Norquist that uses brewed coffee to create drawings._ ![A Fixie - Bike - Coffee on Canvas](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/bike-coffee-on-canvas.Czkx07Lr_ZDeEhv.webp)_A Fixie_### How did you start Coffee on Canvas? I literally stumbled into this art form about 5 years ago when a family friend bought my wife and I a Black and Decker coffee pot. The carafe was amazingly bad – it spilled coffee every time you made yourself a cup of coffee (which is insane given the fact that the team of humans that designed had one task to do….POUR FLUIDS INTO A CONTAINER, I digress). Anyway, I had the pot for a few months, and one morning, as I poured scalding hot coffee over the counter, floor, and my feet, I saw the coffee spill and thought it was an interesting design. I immediately had the idea to outline the spill in black ink so that the form of the spill really stood out. In order to capture this accidental beauty, I began by taping the paper to my countertop and allowing the coffee to spill on the paper during my morning coffee routine. After a month or so of daily coffee brewing, I had a piece of caffeinated art! The problem though is that the paper would always curl as it tends to do when it is wet, so paper soon was replaced with un-curlable canvas, and…..fast forward 5 years…..Coffee on Canvas was born.![PNW Monogram - Pacific Northwest, Coffee on Canvas](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/pnw-coffee-on-canvas.SnwnBt8w_tLWp.webp)_PNW Monogram_### Tell us about the process. I start with a blank, gesso primed canvas and I paint it white with a few layers of Titanium White acrylic – I find the brown on white contrast to be pretty striking, so I like the canvas to be as white as possible, the canvas right-out-of-the-wrapper is much too gray. After a few coats of titanium white, I choose my subject and create a template. The templates are usually made with thick card stock paper or poster board, and what I typically do is sketch the subject until I’m satisfied and then cut out the template. This is useful for a few reasons: 1. It reduces the pencil/sketch marks on the canvas (something I remove or cover later) 2. It allows me to keep an inventory of subjects and designs. One aspect of my art that I pride myself on is that I do not run print editions. Since I have templates for most of my designs, the templates allow me to make a unique piece every time, even if the subject or design is reused. Once the template is made, I transfer the design to the canvas with a light pencil outline. I then determine if I want the subject to be portrayed in coffee or if the subject will be the negative space – once I decide, I mask the areas I want to protect from coffee stains and then begin spilling coffee. The coffee spilling is really a very creative process, as the massing of coffee, leaving white space, the direction of spill/spray, layering, and color (lightness to darkness) of the coffee are all considered. As I spill the coffee in layers I become more and more aware of the “feel” or “flow” I want to create with the coffee. Layering, I’ve learned is key. I usually add about 15-20 layers of coffee, drying each layer after it is spilled, and varying the color with each layer to distinguish it from the last. Since I’ve been doing this for a number of years it’s amazing what you learn about the makeup and flow of coffee. For instance, new coffee is orange while older coffee (1 to 2 days old) is more of a dark brown – I’m not sure the reasoning for this. I’ve also learned that heavy spills tend to coagulate at the edges making a very cool effect. If the layering is done correctly, it creates a marbling effect. After a number of layers, I remove the masking to reveal the protected area. Once the masking is peeled I begin outlining the coffee with ink. I outline every spec of coffee I can see on the canvas, usually requiring me to look at the piece throughout the day so I get a few shades and angles of sunlight to reveal more of the smaller flecks. I ensure I outline the marbling and layered coffee as well, and over the years I’ve honed a technique for this to ensure I capture even subtle tonal changes without striking them through with a hard black ink line. At this point, the piece is essentially done. I apply a few layers of varnish to finish and protect the piece, and lastly, if I’m using silver in my piece it is applied and outlined with ink.![A Lady - Coffee on Canvas](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/dress-coffee-on-canvas.OtgLAY2x_Z1htY1u.webp)_A Lady_### Resources [The Coffee Art Corporation](https://ineedcoffee.com/the-coffee-art-corporation/) – INeedCoffee contribution by Ryan L Lewis.

# Coffee Cup Eraser Art Stamp Carving: Relaxing And Fun [Cafe Culture](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/cafe-culture/)---by [Sandi J. Holland](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/sandi-j-holland/)![Coffee Cup Eraser Art Stamp Carving: Relaxing And Fun](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/coffee-cup-eraser-art-stamp-carving-relaxing-and-fun/image1-5501.jpg) Eraser art stamp carving is a restful and fun craft that can be practiced without a lot of expense. You don’t need much space either, other than a tabletop or a firm board on your lap. Being able to produce unlimited one-off prints, in various colors and layouts, is an additional pleasure. You will enjoy making attractive, handcrafted gifts with your stamp designs. Giving someone the gift of a hand-carved stamp with a stamp pad makes a unique gift that encourages creativity in others.![art supplies](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/image2-550.DGmZ-rO-_1wwlv5.webp) The first step to hand carving a coffee art stamp is to assemble your supplies. - Eraser - Coffee drawing (or you can draw freehand) - Permanent marker - Stamp pad - Sheet of paper - Alcohol and cotton ball - Carving tools ### Types of Erasers Your carving block will be an inexpensive eraser. I prefer the white or beige colors because they usually have a soft but firm texture that is easy to carve. I have found them in a variety of stores. I’m always elated when I find two or three on a card. I have not yet tried using the red or green erasers because their texture sometimes feels less dense and not as easy to carve.![coffee eraser designs](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/image3-550.DZsKJjRR_VVt1i.webp) ### Your Stamp Design If you will be drawing your design onto the eraser, you need to select a permanent marker. I like to use a black Sharpie and chose a medium tip to draw my coffee cups. A fine tip will work better for more elaborate designs. If you are concerned that you may not like your drawing and want to test your skill first, you can use a graphite pencil or soft drawing pencil. If you are not satisfied with your drawing, you may then be able to erase it with another eraser. I wouldn’t spend too much time doing this because the attractiveness of art stamps is their lack of uniformity. You could practice on paper and use your doodles in collages. If you want to transfer a design onto the eraser, you can use carbon or graphite paper. Lay the coated side of the transfer paper onto the eraser. Lay your drawing on top, face up, and trace it. You can preserve your drawing for use in other tracings by using a non-marking tip, such as an empty ballpoint pen or embossing stylus. Other miscellaneous tools include a stamp pad and piece of paper for testing your stamp as you carve, cotton swabs, and alcohol to clean your stamp. ### Carvers: The Most Important Tools Your most important tools are your carvers. My main ones are part of a 6-piece kit from Walnut Hollow. It has two v-gouges, 1-curved gouge, and three flat carvers. This is a good basic variety of blades to remove various amounts of eraser to reveal your design. Though you can use your X-Acto or another blade cutter, it would be more difficult and time-consuming to produce the outlining effect of gouges. I started to like this and was ecstatic when I got my gouges. No more cutting down and in and chopping off pieces of eraser away from the edges of my design. ### Tips For Safe Carving: - Have a firm, level surface to work on. A table or a drawing board for your lap will do. It doesn’t have to be a large space, just stable. - Use sharp tools. They make your work easier, faster, and safer. - Carve away from yourself. This means turning your eraser throughout your carving session so that you are always pushing your knife away from you as you remove material. - Relax and carve slowly. No sharp trauma allowed! Slow and restful carving means no accidents. ### Preserve Your Design By Carving Slowly Whether you are a beginner or an experienced carver, the best practice is to carve slowly. You can always remove more material until you achieve the effect that you desire. You can’t replace material that you accidentally removed because of carving too fast or a slip of the tool.![carve eraser](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/image4-550.HJZp-LcZ_ZFD9GQ.webp) Begin by pressing gently down and forward until you feel the resistance begin to release and rubber material begins to give at the tip of the blade. With practice, you will feel this pressure and release it through the handle in your hand. Once you feel that release, you can push forward with more speed. As you near the end of your stroke, begin to lift the tip upward while pushing forward until the tip clears the eraser block at the end of your line of carving. You are lifting away so that you won’t carve through a line in your drawing. With practice, you will be able to gauge, as you carve, when to start lifting away. If you are carving a line that will take you to the edge of the eraser, then you can carve straight through.![V gorge](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/image5-550.D3fghsfJ_ZYkmFa.webp) ### Check Your Progress As You Carve As you carve, you can check your progress by testing your stamp. When you stamp your image, you can see where you may want to remove more material. You can also see if you have made a mistake in carving, and then decide how you want to correct it. I don’t check my stamp until I feel I am finished, and sometimes I need to carve a little more, but not much. The fun part of carving your design is that it will often not appear exactly as you drew it. You will carve more than you designed on some areas of the stamp and less than you designed in others. And don’t forget the corrections. They will make your original design look different, but you will love it. ### Stamp Useful Clipart Images To Clean Your Stamp Before cleaning you can sometimes stamp a few images, to clean the stamp, on scrap pieces of paper. These stamped images can be used in a collage and other artwork. When you clean your stamp with a cotton ball and alcohol, the ink will leave a stain. While this is a consideration when selling or giving them as gifts, I like the staining. It adds character to my work, and I like seeing my designs clearly outlined on the stamp. You can stamp in all types of colors, as I did with this greeting card and the place card.![stamp 1](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/image6-550.BYPFDJ4I_1rX5ST.webp)![coffee stamp fold](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/image7-550.Br3o2948_Z11BXsR.webp) You can stamp in different layouts, as I did with this wrapping paper.![wrapping paper](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/image8-550.B23MY2pK_Z1P234A.webp) You can clean your stamps by stamping images onto decorative paper and using it in craft projects. I made these two gift tags by cleaning my stamp onto scraps of my handpainted paper. I then trimmed and folded them, punched holes, and added string. I further embellished them with a black marker and a white paint pen.![cards](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/image9-550.DzCToskT_ZlnLgl.webp) Designing and hand-carving coffee art stamps can be just the relaxing project that you need. Enjoying a cup of your favorite rich brew while carving would be even better.![Eraser art stamp carving](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/image1-5501.6XyUM0oW_iihuX.webp) Published on April 11, 2012--- #### Sandi J.

# Coffee Cup 2.0 [Coffee Business](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/coffee-business/)---by [Michael Allen Smith](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/michael-allen-smith/)![Coffee Cup 2.0](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/coffee-cup-2-0/javastix350.jpg) Every year, coffee hobbyists are exposed to many new brewing or home roasting gadgets. Innovation is occurring at the gadget level and with the disposable coffee cup. Until a few weeks ago, I didn’t think there was any way to improve the standard coffee house disposable cup. Let me share with you what I discovered. ### Seeing Temperature The first problem with the coffee cup lid is that there is no way to tell how hot a drink is without touching your lips and tasting it. We’ve all done that quick-kiss sip. Pull up just the minimal number of coffee droplets to detect if the drink is safe enough not to burn the mouth. It would be so much easier if we could just read the temperature, but who wants to carry a thermometer with them at cafes? Smart Lid Systems from Sydney, Australia has come up with a solution. The lids change color based on the temperature of the beverage. If the coffee is too hot to drink, the lid is a bright red. And if the coffee is at a safe temperature, the lid turns brown – the color of coffee.![Smart Lid transformation](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/Transformation-of-Lid3501.dX-qO7AT_luN0O.webp)_Smart Lid transformation_ The lid has an additional safety feature besides saving you from burning your mouth. If the lid color isn’t solid across the top, it indicates that the lid may not be securely fastened. Secure the lid, and the color should become uniform. ### Ending Spills and Locking in Warmth The little opening from which we sip our coffee is the coffee escape hatch. Coffee exits that escape hatch either in our direction by lifting the cup and drinking from it or by accident. You may be transporting just one beverage to the drink holder in your car, or maybe you’re bringing back a tray of drinks for the office. A turn or a tap on the breaks, and coffee comes flying out. Cafes tried to solve this problem for a few years by taping the opening. This idea lost popularity once people realized that the steam from the coffee would loosen the tape, making it functionless. A company called JavaStix has come up with a solution. Using their JavaStix, the coffee opening is closed and secure. When it comes time to drink the coffee, the stick is removed easily without burning your hand.![JavaStix](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/javastix350.PV8cP47P_2bQQbJ.webp)_JavaStix_### A Cup Sleeve With Style Many years ago, fans of quality coffee ditched the styrofoam cups in favor of paper. The problem of burning your hand grabbing a hot paper cup was first solved by using two paper cups. This was clearly wasteful, and thus was born the coffee sleeve. Even though this was less paper waste, it was still wasteful. Cardboard cup sleeves are almost always discarded with the empty coffee cup. WishingFish.com has a stylish solution. They created a line of designer coffee cup sleeves called _Cup Couture_. These cup sleeves are reusable, easy to store, and easy to clean. Some of the styles they offer are Giraffe, Tigress, and Chinchilla. Imagine strutting out of a coffee house in fur _(faux fur), but the fur covers_ your coffee cup, not you. It’s sure to be a conversation starter. WishingFish.com estimates that a coffee drinker can save 6-10 lbs of paper waste a year by substituting the cardboard sleeve with a reusable sleeve. That’s a conversation worth having. Published on October 1, 2007--- #### Michael Allen Smith Michael Allen Smith is both a coffee fanatic and a web developer.

# Coffee Cupping: A Basic Introduction [Brewing Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/brewing-coffee/)---by [Steve Leighton](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/steve-leighton/)![Coffee Cupping: A Basic Introduction](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/coffee-cupping-a-basic-introduction/coffee-cupping-guide.jpg) This article is meant to be used as a basic introduction. There are no right or wrong ways of cupping, but this should help the novice who wishes to enjoy the delights of origin coffee. The aim is to introduce you to what cupping is, why we cup, how we cup and some of the more commonly used terms and evaluation methods. People in the trade will have you believe that coffee cupping is a science, an exact art requiring a lot of expertise. To some extent, this can be true, but this should not prevent the enthusiast from enjoying it. It can be very simple (and enjoyable), and there are no right or wrong answers. Your palate may pick up hints of a taste that the most seasoned cupper would not, as each person can find different things in the cup.![Coffee Cupping](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/coffee-cupping1.C03S9acH_Z14Iuo6.webp)_Coffee Cupping_### What is cupping? Cupping is a method of evaluating different characteristics of a particular coffee bean. Cupping allows us to compare and contrast coffees against each other, and allows us to get a better understanding of each coffee. It is important that you so use the same method each time as this can have an effect on the results, so if cupping is being used as a comparison/evaluation tool then uniformity is key. ### Why cup? We cup coffees to understand their basic tastes. This can help us understand where different coffees could be slotted into blends, not only for this brewing method but also for all other methods. It also makes us look at coffee in its basic form and appreciate some of its finer points. As already said, it’s a fantastic evaluation tool for something that changes from farm to farm, region to region, country to country, and crop to crop. ### How to cup? There are no right or wrong ways of cupping coffee. What I will tell you here is the textbook way of doing it. What I suggest is that you always use any method you use. Any deviations will mean you lose many of the tools you can use to compare like with like. ### Preparation I prefer to roast all my samples to a light roast. This allows the delicacies or the faults to stand out and not get complicated by roast-type tastes. Once again this is a personal choice, not a rule. For a more professional atmosphere, it is a nice idea to have a sample of the green raw coffee, the roasted coffee, and some ground coffee. Although this is not essential, it allows you to judge the quality of the grade, smell the dry grounds, and see the quality of the greens.![Coffee Tasting Table](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/coffee-tasting.EiUF6kme_2jsazM.webp)_Coffee Tasting Table_ The method I will use here is infusion brewing. Grind up your rested coffee (two days of rest is a minimum in my opinion) to a coarse jug type grind. Place the grounds in a small bowl. Pour over nearly boiling water (195-205 °F, 95 °C). Allow the grinds to infuse for around 3-4 minutes. A point quite often missed by some cupping sessions I have been to is that breaking the crust of the bowl will give you a great deal of insight into what is about to come. Take time to smell the coffee at this stage as it will give hints of the kind of things to be looking out for, come the tasting. Once the crust has been broken start to stir the bowl gently allowing some of the grinds to sink to the bottom. Any left on top of the bowl should be scooped away with spoons. Once the surface of the coffee infusion is clear of grinds, the slurping may commence. Don’t be afraid to sound a little silly whilst doing this: everyone does. When at cupping events, I try to make the silliest noise I can without getting spotted by others. It’s a great game, and everyone should play along with it. Take a deep spoon (a soup spoon is a good substitute for the traditional cupping spoon) and fill it with your infusion. Bring the spoon up to your mouth, and _inhale_ (well suck powerfully anyway!), drawing the coffee to the roof of the mouth to tickle the tongue and then fall into the back of the mouth. This creates a coffee _vapour_ to stimulate that part of your sense of taste which is actually your sense of smell. Then roll the coffee around the mouth and begin to look for tastes that you can compare it to. It’s really easy once you’re here, and don’t be afraid to say what you can taste. I’ve found things in coffee that others haven’t, and I’ve also found things that everyone noticed. There are no wrongs or rights, just opinions. Now, this again is a choice, but I prefer to spit out the coffee. It seems a waste, but after 12-18 coffees, even a die-hard caffeine addict like myself can start to feel a little funny from the effects. Also, it’s hard work on the taste buds if you’re swallowing it all, and you’re being unfair to the later coffees. Anyway, coffee should be drunk, not slurped! It’s always a good idea to keep notes whilst doing all this. ### So what are you looking for?**The fragrance of dry grounds** Does it smell fresh? Does it smell stale? Over-roasted? Under-roasted? This is a great place to find out._Examples:_- Sweet - Spicy - Roasty - Nutty - Malty - Carbony - Stale - Fresh**The fragrance of wet grounds** Aroma: what’s there? The water mixing with the coffee and oxygen will produce a more intense smell than with the dry grounds._Examples:_- Smooth - Fresh - Lively - Creamy - Sharp**Acidity / Liveliness** Acidity in a coffee can be a welcome attribute, or it can be a most unwelcome one. In one form it can give liveliness and freshness to the flavour. In another form, it can appear as sourness. Coffee without acidity is lifeless. Coffee with too much or the wrong _sort_ of acidity can be unpleasant, even sour. If the acidity is unpleasant, pleasant, fresh, sour, or whatever – make a note._Examples_- Nippy - Neutral - Soft - Tangy - Tart - Rough - Mild - Delicate - Smooth - Winey**Body**_Body_ is a description of the fullness and richness of the feel of the coffee in your mouth._Examples_- Full - Rich - Fat - Thin**Flavour / Depth** What’s there? This is the fun part. Is there chocolate? Fruit?_Examples_- Fruity - Winey - Buttery - Caramel - Chocolate - Blackcurrant - Woody - Grassy - Honey - Licorice - Malty - Nutty - Spicy (and what kind of spice?)**Finish** What does the coffee leave in your mouth when you have finished? The aftertaste is a very important part of the cup._Examples_- Sweet - Sour - Bitter - Sharp - Smooth - Full - Silky - Burnt - Dry![Wet fragrance](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/wet-fragrance.UmmnD2Eo_Z1y827c.webp)_Wet fragrance_### Comments How would you summarise the coffee? Is there anything you want to say about it that you haven’t been able to express in any of the specific sections of the cupping form? ### Conclusion In conclusion, I hope that this guide is helpful. I am by no means an expert on cupping but I am a great believer in its utility in the evaluation of fine coffees. This is just a set of guidelines and there are no hard and fast rules Everyone from the beginner to the expert can gain a great deal from the experience of cupping. ### Resources [Coffee Cupping – A Sensory Experience](https://ineedcoffee.com/coffee-cupping-a-sensory-experience/) – INeedCoffee article by John Carrier.

# Coffee Cultures: Eritrea and Ethiopia [Brewing Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/brewing-coffee/)---by [Stefanie Spencer](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/stefanie-spencer/)![Coffee Cultures: Eritrea and Ethiopia](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/coffee-cultures-eritrea-and-ethiopia/Eritrea4.jpg) In Eritrea (pronounced er-ih-TRAY-uh), coffee is not merely something that starts on a timer and brews into to-go cups, but it is a ceremony, a ritual, a meaningful time to sit down with friends and family to chat. Many Americans have such fast-paced lives that they miss many important things, like time with friends and family. In this culture, however, they take time to enjoy coffee or tea together. According to one website, “Ethiopia is the only (coffee) producing country in Africa with a traditional coffee-drinking culture. This tradition is reflected in the Coffee Ceremony, a daily ritual performed by native Ethiopian women. Village women gather in one of the neighbor’s homes to share news and nourish friendships. More than just a coffee break, the ceremony is an expression of respect to elders and represents a spiritual time of day to give thanks for the blessings of life.” 1 To experience this firsthand, I took a trip to Jim and Elizabeth Martin’s house for a traditional Eritrean coffee ceremony. We were welcomed in and sat around a very low table where Elizabeth had the green, unroasted Sidamo coffee beans waiting for our arrival.![Eritrea coffee ceremony](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/Eritrea11.BP1OY2ZD_2ehqeb.webp)_Eritrea coffee ceremony_ Opinions and preferences of whether to use Sidamo or Harar, how to roast it, and what to use to brew in are deep-rooted in the families and vary from region to region. She prefers Sidamo, which is a very well-rounded and exquisite coffee. Next to the table was a portable gas burner; in Ethiopia, they would roast the beans over a charcoal brazier, but we were sitting indoors, and the gas burner worked very well. As she was gathering everything she needed, we enjoyed the sweet and woodsy smell of Frankincense and Myrrh incense burning. In some families, it is absolutely necessary to have this incense; without it, they will not drink their coffee. All of the preparations are done in front of the guests, so we watched as she roasted the beans using a small, shallow pan with a very long handle, a menkeskesha, to a medium-dark roast, stopping just as the oil began to show on the beans. She immediately poured them on a round woven mat, about 8 inches across, to let them cool. It is customary for everyone to smell the roasted beans by wafting the smoke towards themselves, still hot and so tantalizing.![Eritrea Coffee Preparation](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/Eritrea2.BxKkgCPO_Z2saByz.webp)_Eritrea Coffee Preparation_ Traditionally, they would then pound the coffee with a mortar and pestle to a medium-fine consistency, much finer than drip coffee but not quite to an espresso grind. The next step is to brew the coffee using a jebena. It is a small, narrow-spouted earthenware pot that they use in Eritrea. In Ethiopia, they use a slightly different variation, theirs having a separate spout lower on the pot for pouring out the coffee. In Eritrea, the jebena has only one spout at the top where they pour in the water and grounds and pour out the coffee. Elizabeth then mixed the grounds with a little water and poured them into the jebena, which had some water already in it, and then placed it over the fire. As we waited for it to heat up, we were nibbling on some Dabo Kolo, a type of bread made of flour, sugar, and water that is cut into very small pieces and then fried or baked in a crepe maker. They are crunchy, slightly sweet, and a perfect snack.![Pour Eritrea coffee.](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/Eritrea3.CdlKsBd__Z1qY1tR.webp)_Pour Eritrea coffee._ Another traditional accompaniment is fresh roasted popcorn hot off of the fire. Just as we were chatting away, the coffee began to percolate and bubble out of the top of the pot. She quickly poured some of the coffee mixture out of the pot into a small cup and then back into the pot, setting it again on the fire. Each time it bubbled up she would do this, maybe five times or so, until she decided it reached the proper temperature and was finished. The wonderful, mouth-watering aroma was filling the room. Then the pot was placed on a special woven holder, since the pot has a round bottom it can not sit on a flat surface by itself. It would need to sit there for a few minutes to cool slightly and let the grounds settle to the bottom. The small Eritrean cups, finjal, were sitting on a tray on the coffee table. Holding only 2-3 ounces, made of fine china, and without handles, they were each sitting on their respective saucer with a tiny stirring spoon placed beside them. In the middle of the table were the cups holding the sugar and creamer. A little sugar is a usual complement to coffee, but because it is so smooth, it hardly needs anything else. By now, most of the grounds have settled to the bottom, but just to catch any remaining that may be floating, she inserts a tiny coil of horse hair into the top of the spout. Gently pouring into the tiny cups, I could hardly wait. Savoring the aroma, we tasted the coffee. Oh so smooth! Not bitter, not sour, not too strong, but only the best qualities of coffee you would want in a cup. Excellent! This is only the first round, up to three rounds can be made out of these same grounds. As she adds water and we repeat the brewing process, it leaves more time to fellowship and for enjoying the Dabo Kolo.![Serve Eritrea Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/Eritrea4.CLj4Yrdh_Z29lYNg.webp)_Serve Eritrea Coffee_ A sincere thank you to Jim and Elizabeth for letting me experience a coffee ceremony from Eritrea. I truly enjoyed it! For those who would like a bit of the experience for themselves, try an estate-grown Sidamo, Yirgacheffe (in Sidamo), or Harar.

# Coffee Cupping – A Sensory Experience [Brewing Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/brewing-coffee/)---by [John Carrier](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/john-carrier/)![Coffee Cupping – A Sensory Experience](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/coffee-cupping-a-sensory-experience/coffee-cupping-table1.jpg) If you’ve tried freshly roasted coffee, you probably have a decent idea of how palate-pleasing it can be. But how good is it really? Moving beyond the basic qualitative levels of judging a cup of coffee (good/not good) to a true critique of your coffee involves a process known as cupping. Cupping is a systematic method used to evaluate different aspects of a sample of coffee, and ultimately to differentiate coffees from one another. There are articles in the archives of INeedCoffee that discuss the steps involved in carrying out the cupping process. However, the purpose of this article is to highlight some things to consider when performing a cupping analysis. Perhaps the first thing to realize is that coffee is something to be experienced, rather than just the taste. A sincere evaluation of your coffee through a cupping session will involve a variety of senses – taste, smell, and feel. It is the interaction of those senses that can create a unique experience. Here’s the basic layout of the main points in a typical cupping review. Note that some items have preference ratings that tend to be judged qualitatively, while others have intensity rankings that are normally judged quantitatively.![coffee cupping table](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/coffee-cupping-table1.Dg8kkRN7_Z2j62i3.webp)_Coffee Cupping_ Dry Fragrance - the evaluation of gasses emitted from freshly ground coffee - preference rating from 1 to 5 Wet Aroma - the evaluation of vapors emitted from brewed coffee in the cup and once it is taken into the mouth and aerated across the surface of the tongue - preference rating from 1 to 5 Acidity - the perceived brightness and zest of the coffee - intensity ranging from 1 to 10 Taste/Flavor - the evaluation of taste sensations and flavor descriptors - preference rating from 1 to 10 Body/Mouthfeel - the evaluation of the fluid for fat content (oils) and heft (sediment/colloids) - intensity ranging from 1 to 10 Aftertaste - the evaluation of sensations after swallowing (duration and descriptors) - preference rating from 1 to 10 Balance - overall liking of the integration of all sensory attributes and how well it all comes together  - Sometimes, this is used to provide “cupper’s points” – additional points to correct for certain scores for a variety of reasons.- Preference rating from -5 to +5  - The overall correlation between sensory attributes – must be significantly better than average to get any additional points. For example, “above average” on our scale gets zero additional points, while “very good” will get one point.The scores are summed and then an arbitrary 50 points are added to arrive at a total in order to have scores be relative to an approximate 100-point maximum for easier comparisons. Even though we’re not entirely comfortable even including an overall number because it is the individual sensory inputs that often have the most memorable impact (i.e. very high acidity, strong winey aftertaste, or a bold single taste like maple syrup), the total score still serves as a decent, widely accepted high-level view of how impressive a particular coffee is. The coffee plant is an amazing creation in that hundreds of different chemical compounds can interact in such a way that together, they make for a truly impressive experience. Quantitatively, that impressive experience amounts to high-scoring coffees – particularly ones with high “balance” scores – and a high score will be evidence of an impressive interaction of the compounds that make the coffee what it is. It is very important to realize that the highest-scoring coffees may not necessarily be the best choice for you depending on your personal preferences. For example, a coffee might have a particular characteristic that significantly contributes to an overall higher score (like a high score for acidity) even though it might at the same time be somewhat disagreeable to your own palate (if you don’t care for a cup that scores high on acidity). Part of the benefit of a cupping analysis is to highlight the aspects of different coffees so that people can more effectively find coffees that match up with their preferences. It’s also important to realize that the roast level will affect the resulting cup qualities, sometimes to a large degree. Typically we try to highlight the roast level that brings out the optimal experience of brewed coffee, and quite often that is a lighter roast.![green coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/image002.CD9_kzNe_Y9xNm.webp) ![roasted coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/image004.DCqd5mKw_2bzciS.webp) So, the roast level is important. Here is the list of terms that we will most commonly refer to in our own cupping reviews. - **City:** this is what you’ll typically get just after the first crack has finished; the lightest level we’re comfortable with when it comes to typical cuppings - **City +:** about one-third of the way between first and second crack; probably the most often used roast level for cupping - **Full City:** about two-thirds of the way between first and second crack which might be quickly approaching; a medium roast level - **Full City +:** the second crack has just begun (and it will accelerate quickly so use caution or your beans might soon be an oily, charred disappointment) - **Full City ++ /Light French:** the second crack is underway, and rolling. The different flavor characteristics, whether aromas or tastes, can come from a variety of sources and are identified through several different wonders of human anatomy and physiology. We’ll spare you the serious science but here’s a bit of background to help you get a handle on some of the typical descriptors that tend to come up in our cuppings. The **aromas** that coffees give off can be classified based on their source. - Enzymatic reactions that occurred while the coffee bean was still growing often make their presence known via gas coming off freshly ground coffee. Typically these aromas are considered to be flowery, fruity, or herby.  - Flowery aromas are further classified as either floral (sweetly floral like lavender, or sweetly herbal like wintergreen) or fragrant (most often sweetly spicy like cardamom or cinnamon)  - Fruity aromas are further classified as citrus-like or berry-like  - Herby aromas can be further broken down into alliaceous (onion or garlic) or leguminous (vegetable or parsley-like)- Caramelization (sugar browning) reactions from the roasting process result in some additional aromas that tend to be picked up after the wet grounds give off vapors full of flavor packets. This is why making note of the roast level is an important point in the cupping routine. These aromas are usually considered either nutty, caramelly, or chocolatey.  - Nutty aromas are more common in coffees that are roasted lighter (City level) and tend to resemble roasted nuts or something more malty (reminiscent of toasted cereal or grain)  - Caramelly aromas are more common in medium roast coffees (Full City level) and tend to be more candy types (toffee, licorice) or syrup types (molasses, maple syrup, honey)  - Chocolaty aromas tend to come out in darker roasts (Full City + and further) and also carry additional adjectives to describe what kind of chocolate the aroma more closely resembles or how much of a butter smell the aroma carries- Dry distillation by-products are more characteristic of a darker roast because they come from the burning of the actual bean fibers. These aromas will rarely come up in our cuppings because we very rarely take our roasts to such a level that would result in an overpowering of the other more delicate aromas. The **taste** of a coffee comes about from the interaction between the soluble chemical compounds in the brewed coffee and the taste receptors in the mouth. You might remember from grade school science class that the four main taste sensations the tongue can identify are sweet, salty, sour, and bitter. The sweet, sour, and salt sensations interact to form a variety of more specific tastes depending on their respective concentrations. It is these more specific tastes that end up being used to classify certain coffee origins. You might see these terms show up in our reviews so here’s some guidance on what they mean. Hopefully, repeat experiences will help you develop your own taste memory. These three tastes will be the ones that come up with specialty-grade coffees as they are more desirable than some other taste descriptors that tend to accompany lower quality coffees and much darker roast levels. - **Acidy** – perceived on the tip of the tongue; related to the presence of sweet-tasting compounds; has nippy (sweeter) and piquant (sourer) as related descriptions - **Winey** – perceived on the sides of the tongue; related to the presence of sour-tasting (not bitter!) compounds; has tangy (sweeter) and tart (sourer) as related descriptions - **Mellow** – also perceived on the tip of the tongue like acidy; generally related to the presence of sweet-tasting compounds, but tamed down from the acidy descriptors; has mild (sweeter) and delicate (less sweet) Finally, with all these aroma and taste descriptors there can be additional adjectives. Gathering up some seasonings from your kitchen or the supermarket can help you train your brain to recognize some traits and may help you become more aware of what is in your cup. Truly, experiencing coffee is an ongoing learning experience and cupping is one way to help with that experience. ### Resources [Coffee Cupping: A Basic Introduction](https://ineedcoffee.com/coffee-cupping-a-basic-introduction/) – Introduction to the basics of coffee cupping.

# Coffee Custard Sauce Recipe [Recipes](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/coffee-recipes/)---by [J.B. Bulharowski](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/j-b-bulharowski/)![Coffee Custard Sauce Recipe](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/coffee-custard-sauce-recipe/CoffeeCustardRecipe.jpg) Humble store-bought pound cake slathered with a coffee-infused custard sauce turned out to be the base for a recent elegant dessert. A former work colleague rolls into town periodically, so dealing with time constraints, the sauce was constructed to give the dessert some sophistication. Homemade pound cake, long proven as a base for a wedding cake, is preferred for this task. Unfortunately, there was no time to spare before our guest’s whirlwind visit. Thankfully, a store-bought cake worked as a satisfactory base, and no one was aware of the shortcut taken. The origin of the recipe is questionable, recently I found a similar one on Epicurious.com. I had the recipe for this sauce cut and pasted onto a 3×5″ card. The card was undated, bearing only a brief note stating the sauce was delicious and would have been yummy eaten alone. Definitely a tempting thought! Choose your coffee carefully to achieve the flavor you want, then make this yummy coffee treat to express your own personal taste. Enjoy!![Custard Sauce Dish](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/custard.yZHhA8u__2jbf3N.webp)_Coffee Custard Sauce_## Recipe: Coffee Custard Recipe**Summary**: _Make a coffee-infused custard sauce._#### Ingredients - 3 Large Egg Yolks - 1/8 Cup Sugar (More if you wish it to be quite sweet) - 1 cup Whipping cream - 1 Teaspoon Instant Coffee Powder - 1-1/2 Teaspoons dark roasted coffee beans Coarsely Ground (Optional) - 1-1/2 Teaspoons Kahlua Liqueur (Optional) #### Instructions 1.

This isn’t an all-encompassing list, but it should be enough to give your education a jump start.**Acidity**: Acidity refers to coffee’s mouthfeel, which corresponds to the amount of time a particular coffee’s flavor lingers on the palate. Typically, the higher the acidity, the quicker the flavor leaves the palate.**Baba Budan**: Baba Budan is the coffee hero who smuggled coffee out of Ethiopia and paved the way for its journey to the rest of the world.**Barista**: A barista is a coffee professional who prepares espresso-based drinks.![barista](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/barista1.CSKQbp1D_d95TP.webp)_Barista_**Blade Grinder**: This type of grinder grinds coffee using a spinning blade.

# A Coffee Drinker’s Guide to Coffee Candies [Cafe Culture](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/cafe-culture/)---by [Ken Shenkman](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/ken-shenkman/)![A Coffee Drinker’s Guide to Coffee Candies](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/coffee-drinkers-guide-coffee-candies/coffee-candy-guide.jpg)_**Editor Note:** Way back in 2001, we published a Coffee Candy Review. For many years, INeedCoffee has wanted to update that article, but we also wanted the writer to be a candy expert. Fortunately, we connected with Ken Shenkman of Bulk Candy Store for a detailed article on coffee candies for coffee drinkers._ As a coffee enthusiast, you want rich coffee flavor with you as often as you can get it. But let’s face it; sometimes it’s just not feasible to carry around a mug of hot java. For those times, you might just consider coffee candy. Because they are made with real coffee, you can think of coffee candies as bite-sized chunks of coffee goodness in a convenient wrapper. Coffee candy comes in a variety of shapes, sizes, and textures, so it can be tough to find just the right one for you. With that in mind, I lined up our best-selling coffee candies and asked everyone at our store to let me know what they thought of each. While people’s individual tastes are different, there were some clear winners and losers. So without further ado, I give you the results…. ### Coffee Prims Coffee prims are a rectangular-shaped hard candy in a bright metallic foil wrap. They are a popular item and did well with our tasters. Most people described the taste as “a good regular cup of coffee”. Smooth and flavorful coffee flavor accented with real milk in the mix._The Verdict:_ A crowd favorite and a good choice for an everyday cup of coffee in a wrapper.![](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/prims-coffee-candy.D-fkma0G_SUvv8.webp)_Coffee Prims_### Coffee Rio Coffee Rio candies are also rectangular-shaped candies, but not quite “hard candies”. They start off as hard candies but will soften a bit over time if you keep them in your mouth; sort of a hard/toffee candy. They are available in a few different varieties of flavors, each with its own unique flavor profile.**Coffee Rio Original** – The consensus on these was that they tasted like a decent cup of regular coffee; smooth and flavorful, with the right blend of coffee flavor and sweetness.**Coffee Rio Café Latte** – Another crowd favorite and the #1 pick for a few folks. This candy features what some say is the perfect flavor combination. Just the right amount of coffee, cream, and sweetness, all packed into a little package.**Coffee Rio Kona Island Blend** – If you’re one of those people who like the bolder taste of Kona coffee, this one is for you. With real Kona coffee in the recipe, this one comes on strong. Not a big winner in our rankings as most of the crew like it a bit milder. This is a solid choice for those who like a really strong and slightly bitter flavor._The Verdict:_ What’s most appealing about Coffee Rio is the variety of choices. Between the flavors, we tried and others that are available, you’re sure to find one that suits your tastes. They even have sugar-free varieties for those of you who are more likely to reach for the Splenda than a teaspoon of sugar.![](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/coffee-rio.Dn-Q_fPq_Z2nopSY.webp) *Coffee Rio *### Coffee Filled Bon Bons These little bites are a very different kind of candy from the others we sampled. They have a hard candy shell with a chewy coffee center. They also seemed to evoke the biggest response from people, with most putting them toward the bottom of the list. Some people mentioned a slight chocolate flavor, giving this a bit of a mocha twist; others didn’t seem to notice. We’ll say it’s a subtle chocolate flavor. Most people stated that the coffee flavor wasn’t as strong as the other candies. One thing everyone agreed on is that these are really sweet._The Verdict:_ Light on flavor, sweet and chewy. If you like your coffee very sweet and mild, this might be a good choice, but if you like more flavor, look at the other choices.![](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/coffee-bon-bons.BoBKYJPJ_1rFSx1.webp)_Coffee Filled Bon Bons_### Bali’s Best Coffee Candy This last candy was a latecomer to the game for us. We received samples just as we were putting this post together. Bali’s coffee candies are round, and hard candies are available in three varieties. They are made with cane sugar and coffee from the Toraja Province of the northern Indonesian Islands, which the manufacturer suggests is among the finest and rarest coffees in the world.**Bali’s Best Coffee Candy** – The general consensus is that this is a good piece of candy. A mild/medium coffee flavor that’s not overpowering made this another crowd favorite, with a few scoring it as a 10.**Bali’s Best Latte Candy** – Like the other latte candy, this one scored well with us. The word most often used to describe it was “creamy”. Medium coffee flavor, combined with that creaminess is why it received more than one “Just how I like my coffee” comment.**Bali’s Best Espresso Candy** – This one has a very strong and not too sweet flavor, prompting mixed reviews from our team. The people who like their coffee milder (the Latte lovers) found this too strong for their taste. Those that enjoy a shot of espresso were quite happy with the strong flavor._The Verdict:_ Overall, Bali’s got high marks from our group, especially the Latte. In fact, we think the product is good enough that we just placed our first order with the company.![](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/bali.Cx6c-WBs_irn7z.webp) *Bali’s Best *### Conclusion After tasting all of these coffee candies, we learned a few things. First, we definitely have a Latte crowd in our office. Second, depending on how you like your coffee, there’s probably a candy out there for you. Finally, we discovered that we need to do mass tastings more often as it’s kind of fun. ### Resources [Bulk Candy Store](https://bulkcandystore.com/) – All different candies, including the Coffee Prim Candy.

# Coffee Enema Benefits vs Dangers [Coffee and Health](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/coffee-health/)---by [Kristina Amelong](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/kristina-amelong/)![Coffee Enema Benefits vs Dangers](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/coffee-enema-benefits-vs-dangers/coffee-enema-benefits-vs-dangers.jpg) Every activity – especially those concerning your health – has risks and coffee enemas are not free from risks. However, many of us are willing to assume risks in our lives because of the benefits. For example, when skiing, we run the risk of severe injuries but are willing to ski anyway because, throughout the entire process, we do everything possible to minimize risk. Then, when we are as safe as we can possibly be, we are able to reap the benefits of an activity in a relatively safe manner. Coffee enemas are no different. Let’s examine a list of potential risks as stated by Tom Mossey in the article [Top 10 Dangers of the Coffee Enema](https://ineedcoffee.com/coffee-enema-benefits-vs-dangers/). These are all valid concerns and throughout the process of using coffee enemas, we must continually try to avoid danger and maximize benefits. Let me speak to each concern in detail. > _1 – Adding ingredients to the enema recipe (such as coffee, green tea, vinegar, baking soda, bath/Epsom salt, or minerals) is not proven to do anything superior to the effects of plain saline._ There have been literally thousands of studies on the dangers of cell phones, and yet the results are inconclusive. Studies take years and sometimes decades to have a conclusive result, and, while what they tell us is valuable, sometimes we must take our own and others’ observations as evidence enough in the meantime. Many people find coffee enemas to be more useful than water-only enemas. > _2 – Inserting anything into the anus may result in anal tearing._ Of course, caution should be taken when inserting anything into the anus. Lubricant and caution should always be used. That said, this risk is not significant. > _3 – Re-used (instead of single use) enema kits may carry bacteria, which could result in an infection._ Obviously, make sure to thoroughly clean any enema equipment before and after each use. Having done that, the risk for infection is minimal. > _4 – Use of hot liquid in the rectum could result in serious internal burns._ Just like when we need to pay attention to how hot our morning coffee is before we drink it, make sure that any liquids used for enemas are of a comfortable but not overly hot temperature. > _5 – Extensive use of enemas could result in dehydration._ Most people don’t drink enough water as it is, but if you decide to take enemas frequently, make sure you’re not forgetting your fluids! > _6 – Overuse of coffee enemas could result in electrolyte imbalances._ Electrolytes are essential to our body’s functioning and as such are lost in any sort of discharge. Sweating, bowel movements, and urination all carry electrolytes from our bodies. Electrolyte drinks like coconut water are great for replacing electrolytes, or simply eating some sea-salted food. Regardless of the exchange of electrolytes, the kidneys do a good job of maintaining necessary electrolyte levels as long as you have a generally healthy diet.![whole coffee beans ](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/cup-coffee-beans.DRm-vpS4_Z1K30ez.webp) > _7 – The caffeine in the coffee or tea enema may lead to caffeine addiction._ While caffeine addiction is an important consideration, taking coffee enemas does not present a greater risk for caffeine addiction than simply drinking coffee. All things in moderation. > _8 – Caffeine enemas must be avoided by pregnant women and people with caffeine sensitivity._ Pregnant women should consult a health care professional before undergoing a coffee enema due to certain risks, but should not rule them out since there can be great benefits especially when pregnant women are experiencing constipation. People with caffeine sensitivity should avoid coffee enemas. > _9 – Overuse of any type of device designed to temporarily excite the nerves of the colon (such as an enema, colonic, or suppository) could result in decreased function of the bowels._ Enemas, particularly coffee enemas, are useful tools, but like anything, should not be overused. As long as you practice them in moderation, they are generally healthy and safe. > _10 – The colonic does not magically remove cancer-causing toxins. It will create watery stool and stimulate the release of fecal matter from the last few inches of the lower bowel. Do not forgo licensed medical attention in favor of this dangerous alternative._ Coffee enemas are not an end-all healthcare treatment, but rather a tool to be used as part of a comprehensive healthcare plan. I appreciate Mr. Mossey for raising these concerns. Coffee enemas are not something that you learn by doing and I would counsel everyone to seek thorough instruction before attempting one. In general, if you know what you’re doing and you use coffee enemas in moderation, you have an exceptional tool to improve your health that has minimal risk.![Ten Days to Optimal health](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/ten-days-to-optimal-health.CGOjF2kG_Z1nGCDK.webp)_Ten Days to Optimal Health by Kristina Amelong_### Resources [Top 10 Dangers of the Coffee Enema](https://ineedcoffee.com/top-10-dangers-of-the-coffee-enema/) – Article by Tom Mossey outlining potential risks of the coffee enema.

# Coffee Gift Wrap Paper and Bags [Cafe Culture](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/cafe-culture/)---by [Sandi J. Holland](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/sandi-j-holland/)![Coffee Gift Wrap Paper and Bags](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/coffee-gift-wrap-paper-and-bags/cpapere.jpg) In this article you will learn how to make your own hand-designed coffee wrapping paper, to make your great gift ideas even better. ### Supplies Needed to Make the Coffee Wrapping Paper - White paper sack, white craft or postal paper, or white gift bag - Craft paint of your choice - Unused (new) coffee grounds - Fresh-brewed coffee or soaked coffee grounds, enough to drip onto paper in a random pattern - Rubber stamps of your choice - Wide flat aluminum or foam pan to hold paint - Brayer to spread the paint in a flat layer or brush to brush paint onto rubber stamps - Gel pen or marker in the color of your choice - Elmer’s glue ### Coffee Gift Wrapping Paper Instructions Gently pull apart the paper bag and flatten, or cut craft paper to the size desired. Lay centered on a flat surface. Drip coffee over the paper, allowing it to splash/splatter. Do not rinse, drain or otherwise remove puddles of coffee. This ensures that your splash patterns will dry distinctly. When dry, if you want more splashes, repeat the process, dripping more coffee onto paper and allowing it to dry.![coffee on white paper](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/cpapera1.Ch-6tjU2_1pv0mi.webp)_Step 1 for the Coffee Wrapping Paper_ Once satisfied with the pattern, spread the paint in a pan or dip the brush in paint. Press rubber stamp into paint or coat with paint from the brush and begin to apply the pattern to paper. Allow it to dry.![rubber stamp bean pattern](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/cpaperb.BrHzorTW_2rLOb7.webp)_Rubber stamped bean pattern (step 2)_ A second color can be used in the same stamp pattern or a different stamp. Decorate with speckles from paint flicked from a brush or a decorative brayer-rolled pattern.![Brayer rolled speckle pattern](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/cpaperc.2M61M2xs_g15re.webp)_Brayer rolled speckle pattern (step 3)_### Project Suggestions 1. Stamp in spaces between your coffee splotches. Load stamp with paint and start in the center of your paper with the first stamping. 2. Stamp a second or third time moving outward to the sides of the paper, making a lighter impression as you move outward. 3. Stamping a balanced but semi-random pattern is easier. Finish your project with a third process, such as paint splatters flicked on from a brush, rolled on with a decorative brayer, or highlight the areas of your pattern with a gel metallic pen. ### Coffee Decorated White Paper Sack![Coffee Decorated White Paper Sack](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/cpapere.Cj99Nsqf_1P3BRF.webp)_Coffee Decorated White Paper Sack_ To do this: dip a mug into coffee and press it onto the sack, making coffee rings. Apply coffeepot and mug using rubber stamps. Draw first coffee stream using a brown marker. Draw second coffee steam with glue and sprinkle with coffee grounds. Draw circles over selected coffee rings with a metallic gel marker. ### White Gift Bag![White Gift Bag with coffee grounds, beans and watercolors](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/cpaperd.lga7x5Xv_2w03cX.webp)_White Gift Bag with coffee grounds, beans, and watercolors._ To do this: draw a bush with glue and sprinkle it with coffee grounds.

# Coffee Fortune Telling With a Turkish Coffee Pot [Brewing Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/brewing-coffee/)---by [Stefanie Spencer](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/stefanie-spencer/)![Coffee Fortune Telling With a Turkish Coffee Pot](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/coffee-fortune-telling-with-a-turkish-coffee-pot/coffee-tasseography1.jpg) What can your coffee do for you today? When you think I have exhausted the possibilities regarding coffee, wait – there’s more! I found this topic very amusing and entertaining. Some may take this seriously, but I have chosen to take it at face value, that is, dried coffee grounds at the bottom of a cup and nothing more. What am I talking about? Please follow me on a journey to the Middle East, Turkey, perhaps… You walk into a dimly lit room and take a deep breath, inhaling the dense and thick aroma of incense in the air. The walls are adorned with deep colors, green and burgundy and gold, and you can hear a jingling noise becoming louder and closer. You sit in front of a small table waiting for someone to arrive. You have come to see her, to enjoy a cup of coffee together, and to see what she has to say – about you. But before you can get to that part, you must have some coffee together first. Turkish coffee, as well as Greek, Armenian, Arabic, or Byzantine coffee for that matter, are similar in their process. If you are familiar with the Ethiopian coffee ceremony, you can find some similarities with it as well. For Turkish coffee, the beans are pulverized with a mortar and pestle or a coffee mill into a very, very fine powder, finer than even an espresso grind. The other items necessary are a small teaspoon, a narrow topped small copper pot with a handle, called a cezve, the spice cardamom, and some cold water.![coffee tasseography](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/coffee-tasseography1.jtqVVfFI_iVM0y.webp)_Tasseography – Coffee Fortune Telling_ All of the ingredients, including the sugar, are heated just to the boiling point, which is very important. If it happens to come to a boil, the foam on the top is lost, and so the whole pot is ruined. After the coffee is made, it is poured into small espresso-sized cups, called fincan, which traditionally are without handles. The grounds settle to the bottom of the cup, and a small amount of coffee has to be left over to avoid drinking the grounds. Now, what can a person do with those grounds left in the bottom of the cup? Sitting at the small table, with the incense around you, your friend finally arrives. She grinds some dark roasted beans, filling the room with a new aroma, and prepares you both a cup of coffee. She fills your tiny white cup, which is sitting on a perfectly fitting small saucer. As you both sip the coffee, you discuss your current life and events, maybe some of your past, but it is for the future that you have come to see her. When the coffee is gone, she has you put the saucer on top and then flip it all over towards you. Now, she will read your fortune. Looking deep into the center of the cup she finds pictures that have to do with your past, symbols that have a greater meaning. If they are black they are negative, may be harmful or sad, and if they are white it will be positive good events. She slowly moves her gaze up the sides of the cup, searching for your present situation and then your future, describing the pictures she sees, their meanings, and how she feels. There is a cat, maybe someone will deceive you. She sees an egg, maybe that will be a new beginning, and a ladder, to move up in life. Very thankful, you leave on your journey, wondering what will really come to be. There are so many contradicting ideas of what the various symbols mean, so each person has to decide for themselves what they think everything means. As for me, staring at dried coffee grounds in the bottom of a cup and looking for pictures is pure entertainment, just as finding pictures in the clouds or in the night sky can spur your imagination. ### Resources [Coffee Tasseography – Fortune Telling with Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/coffee-tasseography-fortune-telling-with-coffee/) – Article by Margaret Wallauer.

# Coffee Grind Chart [Grinding Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/grinding-coffee/)---by [Chris Arnold](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/chris-arnold/)![Coffee Grind Chart](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/coffee-grind-chart/coffee-grind-chart.jpg) How do I Grind My Coffee? What Equipment do I need? What Grind Level? These questions sound like hell for the amateur and heaven for the Coffee Nerd. They mainly mean one more quantifiable way of measuring and another way to spend cash on another gadget. Regarding equipment, you may have to replace that whirly blade grinder you got from the last divorce. The amount you spend depends on what kind of coffee you are making. Drip Coffee isn’t too demanding, and $50 or so should get a nice grinder. French Press requires a consistently coarse grind, but shouldn’t cost you more than about $100 or so for something that will work nicely for both French Press and Drip. Now, if you are doing Espresso, and want to do it right, you will look at something in the $250-$400 range. Most of these grinders will also work nicely for Turkish or Greek coffee, the finest grind. We are going to mention seven grind levels to get you started. Sure, there are probably more levels than that in practice, but this will give you visual cues to feel confident you are close. This article uses high-quality photographs of ground coffee against a U.S. nickel to visually explain these terms.

# Coffee for the Cognoscenti [Cafe Culture](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/cafe-culture/)---by [Martine Nijsters](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/martine-nijsters/)![Coffee for the Cognoscenti](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/coffee-for-the-cognoscenti/caffe-vita-pioneer-square1.jpg) On holiday in southern California, I go into a local coffee bar for a pick-me-up. While I am trying to locate my exact position on the map, I can’t help catching the orders of the other patrons. ‘For me a decaf double tall hazelnut non-fat with a shot of mocha latte’, says a very blonde woman in her thirties sporting a pair of designer glasses on the tip of her nose. The waiter takes it down without batting an eyelid and goes to pass it on to the counter with the same straight face. I am sitting beside a forty-ish man with a perfectly trimmed beard and neatly dressed in pressed shorts and a starched sports shirt. (Who says all Americans are nonchalant?). He wants a ‘venti caffe caramel latte macchiato with whip’. Two very young teens with spiky hair order a ‘Frapuccino’ each. Flabbergasted, I pick up the menu. Am I on planet earth, I wonder? And am I really in the States, where they usually only have a large bubbling pot standing on a hot plate and where boiled dishwater passes for coffee? What are these people talking about?![caffe vita pioneer square](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/caffe-vita-pioneer-square1.CqgTupFF_ZahsTT.webp)_The Cafe Language_ An older lady, who came in just before me and is now rearranging her numerous shopping bags around her with a sigh, brings me back to reality. To the standard ‘Can I help you?’ of the waiter, she replies, wistfully, ‘All I want is a cup of coffee. Just give me the house blend.’ ‘Today’s special or the regular?’ asks the waiter. ‘And what are they?’ ‘Today’s special is Colombia with Mexico, the regular is Sumatra.’ ‘Then just give me the regular.’ ‘Tall drip or espresso?’ is the waiter’s next patient request. I am relieved to see the lady look up in surprise now. Hasn’t she solved the coffee puzzle yet? ‘Do you want a tall’ the waiter repeats calmly, pointing to a stack of paper cups, and then, with the same calm, ‘drip, ‘ now pointing to a large coffee machine, ‘or an espresso?’ moving his finger towards the back of the bar, indicating a shiny espresso machine. ‘Espresso please.’ ‘Venti, regular or ristretto?’ The lady’s eyes widen into large question marks surrounded with exclamation marks spelling ‘help!’. And her patience is wearing thin. ‘Whatever!’ she exclaims, just a little too loudly, while her palms land with a bang on the aluminum tabletop. By now, I’m in a cold sweat myself. I am still struggling with the hazelnut, raspberry, or amaretto flavour that threatens to visit my cup soon. And I’m sure that the waiter will want to know whether I want a half-decaf triple and whether or not I want it sugar-free, no-foam, or non-fat. The young man with the notepad and the unvarying smile approaches my seat. Will I expose my ignorance or shall I have a go at it? I expose my ignorance. ‘I just want a good cup of coffee, preferably an espresso, not too small, no extras.’ The waiter’s eyes become narrow slits, a deep frown appears between his eyebrows, and his pencil suddenly comes to a halt on his pad. Caught unawares by such a simple, clear-cut order, he hesitates for a second, then asks me to wait a minute. He hurries to the barista, the girl behind the counter who has been specially trained to prepare all this coffee madness. She shrugs her shoulders a little uncertainly, but then confirms, with a nod, that she thinks she can manage to produce my order. The cashier has more problems though. With his index finger, he goes over all the coloured buttons on his big machine, and the further down he gets, the more decisively he shakes his head. It’s a no go. The floor manager is called in, and after conferring on the matter, the waiter is sent back to me. ‘I’m sorry’ he says, ‘we can’t ring up your order, because we don’t have a code for it on our cash register. But if you’ll order something extra, I’ll get it for you immediately.’ ‘Well, give me a jug of milk then,’ I give in. I see him getting ready to ask whether I want it large or small, extra-hot or tepid, frothed, sprinkled with chocolate or nutmeg… but then he thinks the better of it, remembering my predicament, swallows his questions, and goes and gets my ‘difficult’ order. I find myself sighing for the simple life of a Flemish village cafe… Published on March 3, 2001--- #### Martine Nijsters Martine plunged into the coffee business some 30 years ago, through marrying an artisan coffee roaster who learned the trade from his father.

This has a slight alcoholic kick and it is a little spicy, so it is strictly for adults.![coffee granita recipe](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/coffee-granita-recipe1.CZHF1-yf_Z1drRY2.webp)_[Coffee Granita](http://www.flickr.com/photos/techsavi/3910515295/in/photostream/) by TechSavi_### Coffee Granita Ingredients - 1/2 cup sugar - 2 tablespoons of honey - dash of cinnamon - 1/2 shot of Kahlua - 1/2 shot of Dark Rum - 2 cups of double-strength coffee ### Brew the Coffee I found that a blend of 75% Kenya and 25% Java Timor roasted to a dark but not oily level works particularly well as iced coffee and excels in this recipe. But if you don’t have access to this type of blend, any dark-roasted, unflavored coffee will do. All you have to do is brew the coffee at double strength. ### Step by Step 1. Mix the sugar, cinnamon, and alcohol in a separate (glass) dish and add the hot coffee. 2. Put the mixture in the freezer for 1 hour. 3. Take it out of the freezer and use a fork to break up the ice. 4. Add 1/2 cup of crushed ice or chipped ice. 5. Continue freezing for a total of 3 1/2 hours. Break it up every hour. The final step is to garnish. Spoon the granita mixture into a serving dish and cover with whipped cream. This recipe serves four.

# Coffee From Thailand [Coffee Business](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/coffee-business/)---by [Len Brault](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/len-brault/) In recent years, Thai coffee has been rising in popularity, and for good reason. The country produces some of the world’s most complex-tasting coffee varieties and has steadily been increasing production with increasing demand. Nacha coffee, a grower based in Chiang Mai, Thailand, produces a strain of Arabica Typica that will win over anyone skeptical of the taste quality of South East Asian coffees. We were lucky enough to not only discover the coffee but to meet the founder of the company, who retired from public life in Thailand to pursue his dream of producing the world’s best Arabica coffee from his homeland. The province of Chiang Mai is located 700km (approximately 435 miles) north of Bangkok and, due to several environmental factors, has produced soil that is particularly good for growing coffee. Though situated in a tropical region, Chiang Mai enjoys a milder climate compared to the rest of the country. The area has lower humidity, a shorter monsoon season, and a lower annual temperature, creating a micro-climate among the Chiang Mai mountains. Rainwater from the mountains seeps into the soil, making it particularly rich in mineral content.![Chiang Mai, Thailand](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/chiang-mai-thailand5001._9mmFUgp_22Glwk.webp)_Chiang Mai, Thailand_ Grown at 4000-5000ft above sea level, Nacha coffee reflects the land’s complex environmental conditions in its taste. For one, the farmers use a multiple picking process to ensure that the coffee beans are always ripe. Rather than stripping the trees all at the same time and later discarding undesirable beans, Nacha’s arabica is handpicked before it is processed. Coffee pickers will do sweeps of the trees picking only the beans that have fully ripened. In addition, the grower sun-dry their coffee rather than putting their delicate beans through several water processes.![Chiang Mai Mountains](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/chiang-mai-mountains.DoxIbT3Y_Z7TPp2.webp)_Chiang Mai Mountains_ The anatomy of a coffee bean consists of several layers that insulate the bean and can affect the taste of the coffee. Rather than being power-washed and stripped of these insulating layers, the beans are soaked to soften the pulp, which is removed, and then the beans are left to sun-ripen, thereby naturally separating the layers. The pulp of the cherry and the parchment surrounding the coffee bean itself (a paper-like layer similar to the shelling of a peanut) contain taste elements that give a more complex and layered flavor to the coffee. Nacha is careful to preserve bits of parchment in order to better conserve the bean’s full-bodied flavor. Nacha growers use minimal processing and manage to clean the beans in the most natural way possible without depriving the coffee of its natural taste. In order to ensure the quality of the final product, Nacha’s beans are hand graded and then roasted in small batches. By doing so, the grower is able to monitor the entire process more closely and guarantee the best tasting final coffee.![Coffee Bean detail](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/coffee-bean.Dab1SwUi_ZEgPsz.webp)_Coffee Bean detail. (Image courtesy of kupajoe.com)_ Travelers to Chiang Mai have the special treat of witnessing the gorgeous soil used to produce Nacha’s coffee. The region’s soil is particularly fragrant, smelling of spices that seep into the coffee giving it a much more complex taste than a typical supermarket-bought arabica. The diverse flavor of Nacha’s arabica rivals that of top Kona coffees, and has recently beaten the world-famous Hawaiian Kona coffee in a taste test, and was given the title of “Best Asia Coffee” at the 2007 Long Beach SCAA. Nacha coffee is not by any means a Kona arabica imitation, but simply what might be a new contender for the world’s best arabica coffee, a position often attributed to true estate-grown Kona. Because of the geographic limitations of Kona production, the critically acclaimed Nacha fills a niche in the coffee market while remaining under the radar and untainted by outsiders. The naturally spiced Nacha bean has an incredibly smooth taste that appeals even to those coffee drinkers who are not otherwise fans of arabica. Coffee-lovers looking to experience a truly outstanding coffee and somewhat wary of the sometimes suspect origins of Kona coffee are in luck because they can now tap into Chiang Mai’s coffee resources. Nacha prides itself on being a “perfect roast” coffee, in that it is incredibly versatile and can be used to make a wide variety of coffee drinks. The coffee makes a superb dessert drink because it lacks many of the bitter elements found in other types of arabica. Here is a recipe created using the Nacha as an espresso, plays up the smooth flavor of the coffee, and is a people-pleaser given its delightful presentation. All you need is one shot of Nacha espresso, milk, cream, or liquid non-dairy creamer (depending on personal preference), and your choice of sweetener. The “Bullseye Espresso” drink makes you feel like you’re in a gourmet coffee shop, yet it requires nothing more than an entry-level espresso machine. > **Espresso Bullseye** First, brew the espresso into a pot or carafe (not directly into your cup). While the espresso is brewing, pour about an inch of milk, cream or non-dairy creamer into your cup. Add sweetener at this point. Important: if your milk is cold, table sugar won’t melt in it. You should use syrup, superfine or confectioner’s sugar, or Splenda/Nutrasweet; or, you can warm the milk first on the stove or in the microwave.![espresso bullseye](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/espresso-bullseye-heart200.-6WZoDcK_22GM1i.webp)_Espresso Bullseye_ When the espresso is done brewing but the machine still has some steam in it, use the extra steam to froth your milk. Milk froths best; cream and creamer don’t froth quite as much, but they still work.Then, pour the espresso in a thin stream into your cup. This makes the bullseye mark in the center. Don’t stir the drink! What really makes this drink special is the contrast between the powerful espresso and the sweet milk. Your first sips are sweet and creamy, then gradually more straight espresso; finally, your last sip is sweet again. For a delicious variation on the Bullseye Espresso, try using a tablespoon of Bailey’s Irish Cream or Frangelico (hazelnut liquer) instead of sugar. Alternatively, you can try adding pure maple syrup, or heating the milk and using Demerar or Muscovado sugar to add depth of flavor. One of the pleasures of dabbling in Thai coffee is accessing a world-class coffee that the world market has yet to discover. Another is dealing with producers who are working in a free-market environment and are extremely concerned both about the environment and the welfare of the communities in which they operate. Nacha family-owned, estate-grown coffees rely heavily on the support of their communities and they give back a lot in terms of infrastructure, assistance to education, and the general welfare. This reflects our own belief that coffee is a crop that is more than just a food product, it has a vast effect on human culture and welfare and has for over a century (it is currently the most traded commodity in the world after water and oil). Thai coffee is exceedingly difficult to procure outside of Thailand. We looked for years to find Thai coffees in the USA, but mostly what we find are powdered coffee mixtures with sugar and spices. Very sweet, they are intended to be used as instant coffee or made into an iced drink. We were lucky to find Nacha coffee when we were down in Philadelphia having some coffee made into pods at ABCD-Pods. Nacha had found this vendor and was also podding some of their coffee into ESE espresso pods. We tried the coffee and were so impressed we asked to be connected to the producer. Nacha coffee is proactive in plans to distribute its line globally. Hopefully, they will bring some further recognition to Thailand as a fine coffee-producing country (635,000 152-pound bags in 2008) as they pioneer the sale of roasted, branded coffee outside of their own country. ### Resources Nacha Coffee – Coffee from Chiang Mai, Thailand. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chiang_Mai) – Wiki page for Chiang Mai, Thailand. Published on December 30, 2009--- #### Len Brault A 25-year veteran of marketing and design, he decided in 2005 that he would turn his strengths to the beverage he loved and began a pilgrimage to find the “original” coffees that he had once loved so much more than the modern-day hybrids and unidimensional Arabicas that seemed to permeate the landscape. He would find the best heirloom coffees that remained largely undiscovered and unchanged by Western influence and showcase these coffees on the Internet. The search led him to Southeast Asian coffees (primarily Vietnamese and Philippine), established a century or more ago and still being cultivated, processed and brewed locally in traditional manners from an era gone by, unknown to the industry, markets, and media in the USA and Canada. Since that time Len has evaluated thousands of coffees in a continuing search for the original, traditional, and unspoiled, and expanded to unique Latin American coffees as well. He has undertaken the task of writing about these coffees, the cultures from which they came, and the manners in which they are brewed and enjoyed. His comment? “It’s a rough job, but somebody has to do it.” His company, Len’s Coffee, is devoted to helping indigenous producers gain access to international distribution under their own brand names so that they achieve the most “fair” of all trades, which is, eliminating commodities brokers and receiving all the fruits of their own labors. The overriding principle that guides his company is the belief that coffee, the second-highest-volume traded commodity in the world, has a tremendous and largely untapped potential to engineer social change and improve the quality of life for millions of people around the globe simply by the practice of making better choices, on the wholesale and consumer levels.

# Coffee Granita Cream Recipe and the History of Torani Syrups [Recipes](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/coffee-recipes/)---by [Sandi J. Holland](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/sandi-j-holland/)![Coffee Granita Cream Recipe and the History of Torani Syrups](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/coffee-granita-cream-recipe-and-the-history-of-torani-syrups/recipe-supplies.jpg) Among the 25.4 fl. oz. bottles of coconut and ginger spice were one bottle of coffee syrup. As I carefully snatched it and clutched it to my bosom I thought, THIS is my best find today! I was at a local salvage retail store of hodge-podge, nick-knacks, and brick-a-brac. Just like at any of the stores throughout the country where freight salvage, insurance losses, and bankruptcy merchandise are sold, you can sometimes scavenge a gourmet delicacy at Solomon’s Ventures. The hefty, fifth-sized bottle told me that this was good quality stuff. My insatiable curiosity told me that that observation would not be enough. Staring at the bold, primary-colored label, I read _Formula Originale D’Italia_. _Hmm_. Must be an old Italian family recipe. What does Torani mean? I stared at the line drawing on the label of a castle in the sky, surrounded by copious foliage. Looked pretty regal to me. Further indication that I possessed a precious and highly-delectable concoction. At home when I added a teaspoon of the nearly black mixture to my cup, I was impatient with excitement. I tasted it in my coffee but knew I’d need to add more than a stingy teaspoon to really enjoy what I suspected to be the coffee liqueur-type of flavor. R. Torre and Co. suggest that you add up to 1 oz., and to please explore other creative uses. All I wanted to create at that moment was a mug-sized dosage of intoxicating, syrup-infused brew that I refer to as _Black Witch_ in one of my coffee poems.![Torani Coffee Syrup](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/torani11.DzG64CCM_ZxV26I.webp)_Torani Coffee Syrup_### Torani History Rinalda and Ezilda Torre introduced their syrups, from handwritten recipes to the North Beach San Francisco neighborhood in 1925. A son-in-law took the helm in 1957 and guided the company’s growth to international recognition. The history account on the website claims that after a family friend experimented with a Torani syrup, espresso, and steamed milk, the first flavored caffe latte emerged. Light research of the word _torani_ produced religious debate references of dati or Torani. I am not even sure that this pertains to the trademarked name on the label. Deciding not to write and ask, I abandoned my research to be satisfied with not knowing why the name was chosen. My insatiable curiosity was satiated, and I preferred to drink rather than to know. My label reads that my Torani Coffee Syrup is delicious in cappuccino, caffe latte, steamed milk, and iced coffee. I especially liked it in my second cup of black coffee (my first is black), which I never thought I’d ever drink. I should have known that after years of happily addictive, creamer-laden drinking, I would become a hardcore drinker. When I grab that fifth of scavenged Torani by the neck, turn it up, and, with heady anticipation, begin to pour the black syrup into black coffee, I know I’m a coffee lush. Torani Syrups can be purchased from the company website and on Amazon.com. Most of the recipes at the site are basic and include two flavors of their syrup. I made my own Coffee Granita Cream based on my grandmother’s homemade frozen banana mousse recipe, or what I could remember of it. This easy recipe takes 1 day to make. ### Coffee Granita Cream - 1/4 cup coffee syrup (or 1/8 cup each of 2 flavored syrups) - 1 pt half and half - 1/4 cup sugar (or to taste) - 2 tsp vanilla flavoring or extract - 1/2 cup strong coffee![granita supplies](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/recipe-supplies.FtAv-C2Z_1RLnNh.webp) The first step in this simple recipe is to gather your tools. You will need: - 2-qt saucepan - metal pan for freezing your granita cream - measuring spoons and cups - large spoon for stirring (slotted is safer for stirring hot liquids) - fork - strainer (optional) Pour half and half into the saucepan and stir in all ingredients. Set the stove to high heat and put a saucepan on the burner. Stir at intervals while on high heat for about 5 minutes, then reduce heat to medium-high. As you stir, the milk will begin to curdle lightly and form little clumps. This is normal. You can strain the mixture later as you pour it. Stir continuously, and when the mixture begins to boil, turn the heat to high again. When foam rises to just short of the top of the pan, turn the heat off and set the pan aside. Allow to cool for 5 minutes and pour into a metal pan, using a strainer if you desire. Not straining will simply allow the solidified strands to blend in with the coarse frozen texture of this crystallized frozen dessert. The main process of this recipe is to stir up the freezing mixture 2-3 times before serving. Place the pan into the freezer for 2 1/2 to 3 hours, then remove and skim the milk film from the surface of the mixture. Place it back into the freezer for about 2 hours or until it is partially frozen around the edges. Remove and stir with a fork, breaking up ice crystals and mixing them in. Return to the freezer for another 2-3 hours and stir with a fork. Repeat this process until you are satisfied with the texture of the frozen treat. This is a recipe that can be served the same day if you start early enough. It will not freeze solid if you stir it at least twice before leaving it to freeze overnight. It can be stirred again before serving the next day. If you want a strong-flavored Coffee Granita Cream, be sure to brew your coffee extra strong. My batch though obviously coffee-flavored and rich has a lighter taste than I expected. I didn’t brew my coffee as strongly as I’d planned.![Coffee Granita](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/granita.Bokfdftf_Z1mfQF0.webp)_Coffee Granita_### References [Dati Or Torani?](http://web.archive.org/web/20140407233857/http://occidentalisraeli.com/2009/02/05/dati-or-torani/) – From the site Occidental Israeli.

# How to Perform a Coffee Enema [Coffee and Health](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/coffee-health/)---by [Alexandra Astakhov](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/alexandra-astakhov/)![How to Perform a Coffee Enema](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/coffee-enema/how-to-perform-a-coffee-enema.jpg)_Warning: The following piece is for informational purposes only and is not intended to be medical advice. Some medical authorities consider this a dangerous procedure, which INeedCoffee.com does not endorse._ The use of coffee in enemas for detoxification purposes is well known. It is a common herbological remedy suggested by holistic and alternative medicine professionals for many years. ### Why Coffee Enema Cleansing Works The effects of a coffee enema are different than a saline enema. The most important difference between a saline enema and a coffee enema is the presence of caffeine in the coffee. Caffeine, theophylline, and theobromine combine to stimulate the relaxation of smooth muscles, causing the dilatation of blood vessels and bile ducts. The effects of having a coffee enema are not the same as drinking coffee. The veins of the anus are very close to the surface of the tissue. The caffeine is absorbed more quickly (and in higher concentration) than when coffee is drunk. ### Benefits of Enemas and Colonics with Coffee Enemas and Colonics have been used for centuries and are generally considered safe. Additionally, coffee cleansing enemas have a chemical makeup that is stimulative. The enzymes in coffee, known as palmitates, help the liver carry away the toxins in bile acid. The coffee is absorbed into the hemorrhoidal vein, then taken up to the liver by the portal vein. With the bile ducts dilated, bile carries toxins away to the gastrointestinal tract. Simultaneously, peristaltic activity is encouraged because of the flooding of the lower colon. Thus, when the colon is evacuated, the toxins and bile are carried out of the body. ### Enema and Colonic Supplies and kits - You will need to buy a reusable enema kit. Enema products are available at most pharmacies. They are usually disposable (although they can be cleaned and reused for several months) and inexpensive. - Distilled water. - Organic coffee, at any roasting level, will do. - French Press pot. ### Coffee Enema Recipe - Bring 8 cups of water to a boil. - Grind eight heaping tablespoons of organic coffee. Put it in a French press pot. You can use a drip coffee maker, but use organic, unbleached coffee filters. - Pour the water over the coffee grounds and let it steep; then, cool for one hour or more. - After this amount of time, the liquid should be about body temperature. If you stick your finger in the water it should be lukewarm or cool, but not hot. - Press the coffee grounds to the bottom, then pour the coffee liquid into the enema bag. - Never utilize flavored coffee, sweetened coffee, or coffee with milk (cafe au lait) for this purpose. Using coffee in a colonic, enema, or suppository will result in cleansing alongside a heightened sense of well-being, pleasure, and a release of toxins. ### Coffee Colonics Some colonic hydrotherapy providers will prepare a coffee colonic. Be sure to speak with your professional colonic hydrotherapist prior to the appointment so that he/she may purchase and prepare the organic coffee in advance. Keep in mind that the coffee will be added as an additive to the colonic equipment, and will therefore be watered down and flushed through rather more rapidly than if you were doing an at-home enema; this is ok too. Colonic Irrigation (sometimes referred to as a high enema) with the addition of coffee is an excellent way to dispel constipation, and achieve temporary weight loss. ### Directions and Coffee Enema Procedures - Make sure to use an at-home enema or colonic kit that includes a bag that is sturdy enough to accept lukewarm coffee. - Make sure that there are no grounds in the enema bag or enema hose; also ensure that the hose doesn’t get a kink in it as this will result in the settling of the coffee oils. - Follow the directions that accompany the enema kit. Lie on your right side, inject and attempt to retain the coffee for 10-15 minutes. - I recommend lightly massaging your abdomen from left to right (up the left side, and then left to right just below the navel). - Additionally, I recommend changing positions while retaining the coffee. After a few minutes turn over onto your back, and a few minutes later switch to your left side before evacuating your bowels.![coffee enema kit](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/coffee-enema-kit.DX6-hhp7_2uyRge.webp)_Stainless Steel Enema Kit_### Unfounded Coffee Enema Concerns and Supposed Dangers Many people are concerned that the body will become addicted to the cleansing and that frequent coffee enemas might encourage constipation. This fear is unfounded. The bowels will continue to function on their own after enemas are discontinued. The bowels should work quite well for a few days after the coffee enema – assuming you are eating a healthy diet with adequate fiber intake. Therefore, using coffee enemas or coffee colonics more than once a week should not be necessary. If constipation is consistent for several weeks in a row and you continue to have cyclical constipation that is only relieved as a result of enemas, colonics, or suppositories, be sure to discuss your situation with a competent medical professional. ### Resources [Top 10 Dangers of the Coffee Enema](https://ineedcoffee.com/top-10-dangers-of-the-coffee-enema/) – INeedCoffee article outlining potential risks of the coffee enema.

# Coffee Gear That Won’t Break the Bank [Brewing Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/brewing-coffee/)---by [Michael Allen Smith](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/michael-allen-smith/)![Coffee Gear That Won’t Break the Bank](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/coffee-gear-that-wont-break-the-bank/coffee-gear-ideas.jpg) Making great coffee at home is something that should be easy and inexpensive. With the right equipment and our [Coffee Brewing Guide](https://ineedcoffee.com/coffee-brewing-guide/), it is. In this article, I’d like to introduce the items on the list and match them with brewing tutorials here on INeedCoffee. ### French Press Which French Press you pick is up to you. The important thing is to have one. French Press coffee is about as simple as it gets. Grind the coffee coarse, add water off a boil, wait 3-4 minutes, plunge, and pour. It is one of the easiest ways to make an excellent cup of coffee. For more purchase guidance check out [Buying a French Press – Picking The Right One](https://ineedcoffee.com/buying-a-french-press-picking-the-right-one/). [French Press Tutorial](https://ineedcoffee.com/press-pot-tutorial/) – This tutorial will get you brewing once you’ve bought your French Press. [Troubleshooting French Press Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/troubleshooting-french-press-coffee/) – If your coffee isn’t wonderful, follow this troubleshooting guide. ### Aeropress Coffee At less than $30, the Aeropress makes an amazing cup of coffee.![aeropress](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/aeropress.DAIP013J_ZzTpcO.webp)_Aeropress Coffee and Espresso Maker_[The Upside Down AeroPress Coffee Brewing Tutorial](https://ineedcoffee.com/upside-aeropress-coffee-brewing-tutorial/)—This detailed tutorial explains the inverted brewing method and provides tips on grind size, brewing times, and temperature. [AeroPress Coffee Maker Tutorial](https://ineedcoffee.com/aeropress-coffee-maker-tutorial/) – A step-by-step tutorial on making coffee with the Aeropress. [Prismo Filter Upgrade For AeroPress Review and Tips](https://ineedcoffee.com/prismo-filter-upgrade-for-aeropress-review-and-tips/)—This attachment will help you make more espresso-like coffee with your AeroPress. ### The Chemex This classic pour-over coffee brewer just requires a custom-sized filter and some hot water. If you are moving away from a plastic drip coffee brewer, this may be the ideal brewer for you. It has a cleaner taste than the French Press. Just be sure to rinse the paper filter before brewing.![](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/chemex-coffee-maker350.CfLWLjhh_ZIhFwf.webp) *Chemex Coffeemaker - [Chemex Brewing](https://ineedcoffee.com/chemex-coffee-brewing-history-and-tutorial/) – This brewing tutorial has been updated with new text and photos three times now. ### Electric Variable Temperature Kettle with Gooseneck Throw out your old kettles. They are too slow. Life is much sweeter when the water you heat for coffee happens quickly. The variable temperature is a great feature if you also brew tea with a wide variance of optimal temperatures. The gooseneck spot allows for a more precise, even water flow for pour-over coffee brewing methods. ### Drip Coffee Maker with Thermal Carafe Drip coffee makers have advanced greatly in recent years. They now brew at higher temperatures, have a more even extraction, and brew directly into a thermal carafe. The days of having a glass coffee pot cook on a warming plate for hours are over. The Bonavita, Behmor Brazen, and Technivorm are three of the best new-wave drip coffee brewers.![](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/bonavita-coffee-brewer400.nxwuRLsb_2fBuBg.webp) *Bonavita Carafe Coffee Brewer - ### Bean Grinders The importance of grinding your coffee cannot be understated. It is the single most important thing you can do to improve your coffee quality. Below are two grinders. The Cuisinart is my _ghetto_ pick. It is cheap and extremely loud, but it works if you are on a very low budget. People in the industry have told me that The Virtuoso is the best non-espresso coffee grinder on the market. You’ll need something better for espresso, like the Rancilio Rocky Grinder. With grinders, you get what you pay for.![cuisinart](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/cuisinart.D56P_6Th_DOLj.webp)*Cuisinart DBM-8 Supreme Grind Automatic Burr Mill - ![](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/baratza-virtuoso-coffee-grinder.DZhRJD4J_6Y9jN.webp) *Baratza Virtuoso Coffee Grinder - ### Specialized Coffee Brewers The Clever Coffee brewer is gaining popularity as an excellent way to make a single cup of coffee. Place the filter with the ground coffee into the brewer. Add hot water. Wait a few minutes and then place the brewer on your mug. This will open the bottom part of the brewer, allowing the coffee to be brewed directly into your mug. The Clever is as rich as the French Press but without any sediment.![](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/clever-coffee-dripper400.ZOwM03D1_ZMYsAH.webp)_Clever Coffee Dripper_ For more information, read [Clever Coffee Dripper Review](https://ineedcoffee.com/clever-coffee-dripper-review/). [A Clever Way to Make Iced Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/clever-way-make-iced-coffee/) – You can also make Japanese-style iced coffee with the Clever. The Bialetti Stovetop Espresso Maker is used to make Cuban coffee. The Ibrik is used for Turkish Coffee, and for Vietnamese Coffee, you will need a coffee filter set.![bialetti](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/bialetti.BbUzDcXV_2eGcdW.webp)*Bialetti Moka Express Espresso Maker, 6 Cup - ![](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/turkish-ibrik.Bc6duvhD_Li4j9.webp) *Turkish Ibrik - ![vietnamese-coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/vietnamese-coffee.3A9MlEl4_Z1GzV4R.webp)_Vietnamese Coffee Filter_[Cafe Cubano (Cuban Coffee)](https://ineedcoffee.com/cafe-cubano-cuban-coffee/) – Cuban coffee brewing tutorial.

# Coffee Health Myths Explained [Coffee and Health](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/coffee-health/)---by [Ryan Jacobs](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/ryan-jacobs/)![Coffee Health Myths Explained](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/coffee-health-myths-explained/skull-late1.jpg) For a long, long time, researchers have been investigating the impact drinking coffee has on the human body. This article focuses on some of the more common misconceptions related to coffee and health. It is important to realize what the studies are actually saying and not to draw incorrect conclusions based on reading the study. ### #1 Unfiltered Coffee Increases Health Risks Two recent studies have been published citing that drinking coffee which is unfiltered as in the French Press method are associated with an increase in LDL (bad) cholesterol and or homocysteine levels. The first study, by Dr. Marina Grubben et al, published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition was conducted in the Netherlands. It involved studying 64 healthy adults drinking six large cups of unfiltered coffee or another beverage during a two-week period. The results showed that there was an increase in homocysteine levels of 10% in individuals who consumed unfiltered coffee. They linked this to an increased risk of heart disease by 10%. In another study, participants drank unfiltered coffee for two weeks and were compared to those who drank filtered coffee. There was an increase in serum LDL cholesterol of 2mg/dl for those drinking unfiltered coffee. After two weeks, they switched to filtered coffee and the serum cholesterol returned to baseline. These studies, while interesting, don’t tell us anything about the long-term effects. A two-week study does not give us an answer to the long-term risk of drinking unfiltered coffee. In the homocysteine-related study, the control group didn’t even drink coffee. Yet the way this has been reported is that it is healthier to drink filtered coffee. A more recent study has shown that homocysteine levels did not drop when drinking filtered coffee. There has been trouble isolating the cause. Is it the caffeine? Who knows? More research is needed.![skull latte](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/skull-late1.C3yUlgRB_Z11iDgE.webp)_Is this latte signaling a health risk?_### #2 Coffee Leads To Heart Disease It has long been thought that coffee, as a stimulant, would lead to various forms of heart disease. The recent literature. however, suggests that coffee is safe in moderate doses. Recently, one researcher, Warren G. Thompson, M.D., noted in a 1994 literature review on this subject: “The largest and better studies suggest that coffee is not a major risk factor for coronary disease.” Additionally, a major study conducted by Willet, et al., examined data collected from more than 85,000 women over a 10-year period. Upon adjusting the data for known risk factors such as smoking, they found no increased risk of CVD for women who drank six or more cups of coffee per day. A 1990 study by Diedrich, et al., looked at 45,000 men. It found no link between coffee, caffeine, and CVD in men who drank four or more cups of coffee per day. ### #3 Coffee Causes Ulcers Oftentimes, when people see me drinking a cup of coffee they give the warning “You shouldn’t drink coffee, it will give you ulcers.” The thinking, until recently, was that excess stomach acid caused ulcers and that coffee would contribute to the stomach acid. Recent studies however show that most ulcers are caused by a particular bacteria, namely _Helicobacter pylori_. These ulcers can be cured easily with antibiotics. An important distinction to make is that while coffee or spicy foods for that matter don’t cause ulcers, they may serve to aggravate existing ulcers. ### #4 Coffee Is Bad For Reproductive Health Miscarriage, low birth weight, infertility. These are all commonly associated with increased coffee consumption. However, there has been little convincing evidence that a moderate amount of caffeine during pregnancy will cause these conditions. Scientists have had trouble linking the consumption of coffee to miscarriage. There are many confounders in this area. As an example, it has been found that women who don’t experience nausea during pregnancy are more likely to miscarry. This could be due to them being less likely to stay away from foods and beverages that cause nausea. Therefore, coffee could be lumped in together with many other things that are consumed that should be avoided. Low birth weight in children has not been proven even at high caffeine consumption levels in women. A 1993 study by Larroque, et. al., found that women who consumed more than 800 mg of caffeine daily had no greater risk than women who did not. Furthermore, studies have also shown that women who drink more than three cups of coffee daily are at no increased risk of infertility or delayed conception. ### Conclusion Certainly, there have been many other studies conducted on coffee and health and many more will be performed in the future. But before you jump to the conclusion that you are going to die a premature death, read the article a little closer and seek out related articles to see if there is conflicting data. And in the meantime, enjoy your coffee in moderation.

# Coffee History Primer [Coffee History](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/coffee-history/)---by [Ryan Jacobs](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/ryan-jacobs/)![Coffee History Primer](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/coffee-history-primer/Coffee-History-Primer.jpg) The history of coffee is perhaps richer than the beverage itself. A heroic cast of characters has developed from the initial discovery to the eventual worldwide distribution. Coffee was first discovered in Northern Africa in an area we know today as Ethiopia. The most common legend refers to a goat herder by the name of Kaldi, who observed his goats dancing in a frenzy after eating berries from a bush. Curious, Kaldi tried eating the berries himself. He quickly found himself dancing alongside his herd from the renewed energy the berries gave him. The news of this energy-laden fruit quickly spread throughout the region. Monks hearing about this amazing fruit, subjected it to many tests. They ended up drying the seeds of the fruits and making a beverage from the unroasted bean which was quite strong and pungent. Coffee berries were transported from Ethiopia to the Arabian peninsula and were first cultivated in what today is the country of Yemen. Coffee then traveled to Turkey, where coffee beans were roasted for the first time over an open fire. The roasted beans were crushed and then boiled in water, creating a crude version of the beverage we enjoy today. Coffee first arrived on the European continent using Venetian trade merchants. Once in Europe, this new beverage fell under harsh criticism from the Catholic church. Many felt the Pope should ban coffee, calling it the drink of the devil. To their surprise, the Pope, already a coffee drinker, blessed coffee declaring it a divine beverage. Coffee houses spread quickly across Europe becoming centers for intellectual exchange. Many great minds of Europe used this beverage, and forum, as a springboard to heightened thought and creativity. In the 1700s, coffee found its way to the Americas by way of a French infantry captain by the name of Gabriel de Clieu who nurtured one small plant on its long journey across the Atlantic. De Clieu gave up his water rations so that the plant would survive. This one plant, transplanted to the Caribbean Island of Martinique, became the predecessor of over 19 million trees on the island within 50 years. It was from this humble beginning that the coffee plant found its way to the rest of the tropical regions of South and Central America.![Gabriel de Clieu](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/gabriel-de-clieu-coffee.UDLFt3Cu_1trwW6.webp)_Gabriel de Clieu_ Not to shed its political ties, the Continental Congress declared coffee the national drink of the then-colonized United States in protest of the excessive tax on tea levied by the British crown. The development of canned coffee was initially considered a luxury and more valuable than the whole bean coffee we value today. It was a convenience to have it roasted for you and then to be able to do nothing more than open a can, measure, and brew. Due to poor and lengthy shipping methods, this improved the quality for most consumers. Coffee has played an integral role in society since its discovery centuries ago. As I can not imagine life without it, I hope this continues for centuries. ### Resources [My Coffee Tis of Thee: America’s Patriotic Coffee History](https://ineedcoffee.com/my-coffee-tis-of-thee/) – More coffee history.

# Coffee is Loaded With Antioxidants [Coffee and Health](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/coffee-health/)---by [Michael Allen Smith](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/michael-allen-smith/) I always knew coffee had some antioxidants but was unaware it had more than tea. Antioxidants protect the body from free radicals. Dr. Jonny Bowden, in his book The 150 Healthiest Foods on Earth, lists Coffee as one of the top 150 foods. He even states that it has antioxidant power greater than tea or cocoa. > …a study in the _Journal of Agriculture and Food Chemistry_ in 2001 found that coffee has significantly more total antioxidant activity than either cocoa, green tea, black tea, or herbal tea. What makes coffee such a rich source of antioxidants? According to Dr. Bowden, coffee has chlorogenic acid and caffeic acid. Both are strong antioxidants. The Coffee Science Information Center states 200 ml of arabica coffee (~6.7 ounces) can contain between 70 and 200 mg chlorogenic acid. Wikipedia has this to say about chlorogenic acid and caffeic acid: > Chlorogenic acid and caffeic acid are antioxidants in vitro and might therefore contribute to the prevention of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus and cardiovascular disease. It is claimed to have antiviral, antibacterial and antifungal effects with relatively low toxicity and side effects, alongside properties that do not lead to antimicrobial resistance. The Coffee Science Information Center also reports that the roasting time of coffee will impact the antioxidant levels. > The roasting of coffee beans dramatically increases their total antioxidant activity. A roasting time of **10 minutes (medium-dark roast)** was found to produce coffee with optimal oxygen scavenging and chain breaking activities _in vitro_ (6).![150-healthiest-foods-on-earth](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/150-healthiest-foods-on-earth1.BPZJn8oZ_NHEcE.webp) I think I’ll have a mug of antioxidants. ### Resources [Coffee is the number one source of antioxidants](https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/560866) – 2005 study by the American Chemical Society.

# Coffee In Israel [Coffee History](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/coffee-history/)---by [Myron Joshua](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/myron-joshua/)![Coffee In Israel](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/coffee-in-israel/is_arabcoffee1.jpg) In a recent article in the Jerusalem Post, the Israeli English Language daily, Herb Keinon writes about “Culture in a Cup”, the growth of coffee shop culture in Israel during the past five years. During the 1940s and ’50s, Israel (a young country now only 52 years old) used to have coffee shops that had a thriving business selling…soda water (flavored and unflavored). That’s what people could afford when they were looking for a quiet spot to sit and talk with friends or argue ideology (a great pastime amongst the ideologues and writers of this new immigrant society.) Coffee was rare in the country that had to ration food during difficult war times and had to invest in the very basics to absorb immigrants and post-WWII refugees.![Preparing coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/is_arabcoffee1.CZW8gmhO_1q9Lit.webp)_Preparing coffee_ Ironically, it may have been the harsh times and required military service (including reserve duty of one or two months a year for all adult males through the age of 50) that laid the cornerstone for a now striving coffee culture that includes espresso bars, outdoor cafes throughout the country. In a recently published Coffee Table book about coffee itself, author Matam Shiram writes about the ritual of coffee preparation in the Israeli army: > Coffee in the reserves is our exclusive invention. It is an Israeli institution that is difficult to describe…You have to imagine the dunes and the beating sun (or conversely the pouring rain), the sweaty uniforms, the smell of oil on the tank… And it is especially necessary to imagine the smell of the coffee cooking in the finjan…![Brewing coffee over fire](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/is_brew.DpBD_GNt_2jz3Ry.webp)_Brewing coffee over a fire._ Coffee in the reserves is the best way to unify a group. People who are different and even strangers make coffee (Probably arguing about how many times the coffee should come to a near boil before it is perfect-MJ), sip it and for a minute are closer to each other than brothers. Coffee in the army…provides warm and sweet solace.” The ritual begins when reservists report from their homes with a special toolbox containing a portable camping stove, finjan (actually an ibrik,) sugar, coffee, small glasses, and matches for use on patrol or in the barracks. This culture carries over into civilian life when families go out camping. In the middle of the night, in the middle of nowhere, a family get-together is not complete without the preparation of Turkish coffee at the campfire or over the portable stove.![Campers enjoying coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/is_group.DOEPrfAh_1gdY4c.webp)_Campers enjoying coffee._ This experience is where the Israeli learns to appreciate not only the drink but also the joy of hovering over a cup. Observers claim that this is the reason that the Israeli attitude to coffee drinking is a sit-down, take it easy, and enjoy the company attitude unlike the “drink on the run” attitude prevalent in other countries. This attitude is rooted in the culture of the Middle East itself. The early Jewish pioneers appreciated the importance of the social aspect of coffee consumption they saw in the daily life of the Bedouin tribes and the local Arab population. Now, modern Israeli society has added other contraptions to the finjan and portable stove: the espresso machine can be found at the coffee bar, at work, and at home. But this revolution only came about during the past five years.![Stir campfire coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/is_stir.eZGBcJAf_1YgA0H.webp)_Stir campfire coffee._ Nescafe was big during the ’60s and ’70s. The Hebrew word “nes” means miracle, and that is what people thought they discovered: a miracle. Hot water and some dark powder and voila, a cup of coffee. It couldn’t really be compared to Turkish coffee, known as “cafe botz” or “mud coffee”, but it was cleaner and simpler and seemed so-o-o-o American. The prosperous years ahead brought the oncome of freeze-dried, Taster’s Choice, etc. as Israel always likes to keep up with the Joneses from America. As Israelis began traveling the influence of modern European culture became more prevalent. Israel has become a place where Mid-East, European and International cuisine are all growing alongside Mcdonald’s and Burger King. These cosmopolitan (and “yuppie”) tendencies paradoxically combine with the root social experience of coffee drinking in the Israeli Army to create an atmosphere conducive to the widespread growth of espresso cafes throughout the country. Published on July 18, 2011--- #### Myron Joshua Myron Joshua grew up on Chocolate Milk with the gurgling of his mother’s Folgers being percolated in the background. At age 18 while living on a Kibbutz in Israel he learned to drink “cafe botz” (Cooked turkish coffee) in the communal dining hall before going to the fields at 5:30 am. From then it was 30 years of instant coffee (no sugar, no milk) until someone poured him a cup of brewed Sumatran. Now he grinds his own beans before going to work at his office in Kibbutz Kfar Etzion.

# Coffee House Stereotyping [Coffee Business](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/coffee-business/)---by [Rachel Elliot](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/rachel-elliot/)![Coffee House Stereotyping](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/coffee-house-stereotyping/expresso-sign1.jpg) Can a book be judged by its cover? Sometimes. When it comes to sizing up the quality of a coffeehouse, appearances can usually convey a lot of information. Trying to find an excellent espresso or a damned fine mug of coffee is always a gamble. We often stroll into a new coffee house wide-eyed, eager, and believing that the proprietors’ expertise will deliver us from a tired haze into a jittery oblivion. We plunk down a few dollars and anxiously wait for a handcrafted beverage to slide. Instead, we’re handed a gut-wrenching drink you wouldn’t put in Hell’s break room. How do we, the connoisseurs of quality, protect our taste buds and money? Insurance companies have actuaries to protect them from unnecessary risks statistically. We fellow espresso drinkers need similar guidance. I’ll be your guide as we walk through these mean espresso streets. In this article, I’ll detail some telltale signs of coffeehouses to stay away from without sampling their wares. Let’s get started. ### Spelling Never, never, never buy anything from a coffeehouse that spells espresso with an ‘X. Don’t even buy a muffin. If you find yourself inside this caffeinated booby-trap, don’t panic. Slowly step back and run when you’re at a safe distance. This shop is run either by someone who thinks the ‘X’ spelling is cool or, more likely, a person who is an idiot. I’ve NEVER had even a mildly decent drink from a place that spells espresso with an ‘X. ‘ My **Espresso Golden Rule** is “If you can’t spell it, you can’t make it!”![expresso sign](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/expresso-sign1.DmQPbKzY_je5OB.webp)_[“Expresso”](https://www.flickr.com/photos/kyz/2732787231/in/photostream/) by kyx_### Bizarre Pricing Have you ever been to a place that charged more for a straight espresso than a latte? It’s rare, but it happens. What about a place with a considerable price difference between hot and iced beverages? Does the menu show a lack of pricing logic? All drink prices should follow a general pattern; when they deviate too much, it is a sign that someone may not know a cappuccino from a Yoohoo. Cafe owners should know the industry very well. When somebody ignores the industry and prices menu items illogically, they may also ignore the standard for making the drinks. ### The Mall Although there are exceptions to every rule, coffee places in shopping malls will almost always be subpar. A captive and non-sophisticated coffee drinker is the least demanding consumer, and these businesses respond accordingly. I still remember a certain large mall coffee chain selling leftover Christmas blend coffee for 50% off in June. If you need a jolt the next time you’re stuck in the mall, go to GNC and buy some diet pills._Editor’s Note: This article was written in June 1999. Since then, things have started to change. There are now quite a few micro-roasters operating in shopping malls that make excellent coffee. It should be easy to detect a quality roast-on-premises operation._### Eyeing the Equipment In the great effort to get rich by serving espresso, a few tight-fisted cafe owners decide to go cheap when buying equipment. There is a difference between buying equipment for the coffee shop and home, yet some places don’t grasp that concept. I’ve seen cafes that use $12 drip coffee pots and $50 espresso machines. That may be OK for the homeless shelter, but I’ll be damned if I’m going to pay money for one of those drinks. ### Going the Distance This method is directed at those swanky coffeehouses that have lots of space. They have so much space that they spread the drink operation to great lengths. By lengths, I mean physical distance. You order at the register, and somehow, your drink gets delivered to a barista 50 yards away. A simple order turns into the childhood game “Telephone”. Remember that game? It’s where one person whispers a story, and it gets passed around. When the last person hears the story, the message is all mangled. The same principle applies here. Your “double short soy latte” becomes a “frozen mocha with spoiled milk.” The problem in this scenario is that you are paying for a professionally made drink. Yet the only person you can speak to hasn’t been trained on anything but the cash register. So, like an arranged marriage, you don’t even meet up with your drink until it’s finished at the other end of the coffeehouse. All you can do is hope that another customer doesn’t grab your drink by mistake first. The barista doesn’t know who ordered which drink, so he or she can’t stop the woman with the mustache from grabbing your latte and screaming “I don’t taste any Hazelnut” after she has added 12 packets of Equal to your drink. To sum up, the further the distance between the place or order and the place or drink pickup, the greater the chance of errors in the drink. Proceed with caution and stay away if the cafe is busy. ### Cleanliness If a cafe can’t keep the shop clean and looking good, then it probably can’t keep its coffee equipment clean and well-maintained. A clean shop will probably have better coffee. Enough said. ### Smoking Policy Someone who loves and appreciates the delicate taste of quality coffee will not allow smoking anywhere near where the drinks are being made. Smoke will ruin the taste of coffee. I once knew a coffee shop run by a gentleman who loved coffee. Unfortunately, his first love was cigars. His shop was set up to be a cigar coffee shop. “Smoke the best cigars and drink the finest coffee” was the concept. The sad reality was “smoke the best cigars and drink the finest cigar-flavored coffee.” Cigar smoke hung in the air and surrounded his beans. Within weeks of opening, his best Kona tasted stale and lifeless, and the shop went out of business rather quickly. Granted, this is an exaggerated case, but the concept is the same. The more a coffee shop does to protect the bean, the more likely the drinks will be good. Black coffee and black lung do not mix. ### What Gets Top Billing? What is the first thing you see when you first look into a coffee shop? Is it ice cream, pretzels, flavored coffee, juices, regular coffee, or an espresso-based drink? Nine times out of ten, whatever is most prominently displayed is what they do best. When gourmet coffee or espresso looks like a side dish, look for the door. ### Summary Finding a great coffeehouse in your neighborhood or while on vacation is always exciting. Coffee drinkers’ sense of adventure propels them to seek out great new blends of coffee or well-made lattes. Unfortunately, many poorly run cafes have turned this glorious adventure into the equivalent of navigating a minefield. Keep your wits and learn to develop your cafe stereotyping skills to protect you on your journeys. Good luck!

# Coffee Meth Myth? [Coffee and Health](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/coffee-health/)---by [Alex Scofield](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/alex-scofield/)![Coffee Meth Myth?](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/coffee-meth-myth/meth_line.jpg) What the Internet sorely needs these days is a paranoia-inducing urban myth. A year ago, one struck close to home for many coffee-drinking travelers. NBC affiliate TV stations in Memphis, Tenn., and Huntsville, Ala. ran nearly identical news stories in early 2007 that said hotel room coffee pots are sometimes used to make methamphetamine. The articles quoted a drug enforcement officer from Marshall County, Ala., who said that mini-coffee pots were “an ideal heat source” for cooking the illegal drug and a Marshall County district attorney who said he would never use a coffee pot in his hotel room, no matter how nice a hotel. Once again, life imitates _The Simpsons_ – “The coffee you’re drinking in your hotel room may cause nausea, vomiting, or a trip to the hospital. Details at 11.” Not surprisingly, bloggers loved this one. In February and March, the story made a bit of a ripple in the blogosphere, spurring intense back-and-forth in the comment sections. Could meth really be manufactured in a mini-coffee pot? Even if it could, would anybody cook it up in a hotel room? As is the nature of the news/blog cycle, the story made a ripple, then faded from discussion a few weeks later. There was little in the way of follow-up from conventional news media, and bloggers moved on to other subjects. And so, a year after the news stories were reported, the question remains. Was this just crass sensationalism, or should hotel guests be concerned about brewing coffee in their rooms?![Crystal meth](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/meth_crystals1.DVQT0JP6_RUzH2.webp)_Crystal meth_### I’ve Seen It Many Times Jim Wingo said the story is legit. A sergeant with the Missouri State Highway Patrol, Wingo said it’s not only theoretically possible to cook meth in a small coffee pot but a reality he’s come across on the job. “I’ve seen it many times,” Wingo said – both instances where the meth was cooked in a coffee pot, or the carafe has at least been used as glassware. Roger Lake of the Washington State Narcotics Investigators Association said he never saw any evidence of coffee-makers being used to make meth, but he doesn’t have any difficulty believing they could be put to such use in a hotel room. “It’s not far-fetched at all, because a lot of people go to hotels [to cook meth],” he said. That’s a far cry from the image many people may have of meth labs existing only in extremely remote areas. There was merit to that image more than 10 years ago when the once-predominant P2P (Phenyl-2 propanone) method of producing methamphetamine required far more precursor chemicals than could fit in a small container. In the mid-1990s, however, other methods of meth manufacture caught on, some of which are as simple as heating up a container. There are even methods that require no heat. “It’s so easy,” Wingo said. “Easier than you can probably imagine.” The cold-cook “Nazi” method and the red phosphorous (“Red P”) method of manufacturing methamphetamine could both transpire in a miniature coffee-maker, said Lake, co-author of _The Meth Prevention Cookbook_. “All it takes is a vessel to cook it in,” said Lake. A plastic bucket, a soda pop bottle, or a glass carafe from a coffee maker would do the trick. Heating the ingredients isn’t even necessary, although it will speed up the process and result in a higher-quality yield. In fact, a coffee maker is an ideal vessel for the Nazi method, according to an Oklahoma Narcotics Officers Association report on red phosphorus methamphetamine labs by Detective Kurt Short in Lawton, Okla. Police Department. The Nazi method typically produces only one- or two-ounce quantities, enough for personal use, and small enough for the mini coffee maker. ### Cooking Under the Radar Even if methamphetamine can be manufactured in a mini-coffee carafe, why would anybody do it in a hotel or motel? The byproduct of meth manufacturing is legendarily toxic and smelly – Wouldn’t a hotel-room meth bake be obvious to anybody within a mile of the room? Not necessarily; not in the 21st century. Lake and Wingo agree that more current manufacturing methods could be harder to detect than the old-school ways. “The old method, the one that took 24 hours …stunk really bad. It smelled like cat urine,” Lake said. “With the newer methods, it doesn’t smell that bad.” The Nazi method gives off an ammonia odor during the later phases, but it’s comparatively faint. “You can smell it, but it dissipates quite rapidly,” Lake said. “If it’s done correctly, the odor can be eliminated,” Wingo said. The same can conceivably go for visual evidence. The Huntsville, Ala. article says that coffee pots used to cook methamphetamine will have a dark reddish-orange stain. If only it were always so obvious. Lake and Wingo agree that a meth cook could clean glassware so that it left little visible trace. Consider a typical high school chemistry lab, Wingo said. “They mix all kinds of weird chemicals every day, and all they do is clean the glassware.”![Powdered crystal meth](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/meth_line.BqSkwEi4_Z1rcPIv.webp)_Powdered crystal meth_### On the Decline In Washington State, Lake said, the manufacturing of meth in personal-use labs is way down. That’s also been the national trend since 2004, according to the National Drug Intelligence Center’s _2008 Methamphetamine Threat Assessment_. It’s a startling decline. From 2004 through 2007, the number of meth lab seizures in the U.S. each year fell by nearly 80 percent. The lawless, law-abiding, and law enforcement alike attribute this trend to the arrests of meth manufacturers and the crackdown on wholesaling precursor chemicals. The U.S. _Combat Methamphetamine Epidemic Act_ of 2005 imposed heavy regulations on the sale of ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, and phenylpropanolamine products that could be used in cooking meth. “It hasn’t stopped demand,” Wingo said. Mexican drug cartels have filled in the production void, and more methamphetamine now comes across the border from Mexico, Wingo said. “It’s basically the same stuff, but they’re making hundreds of pounds at a time.” This means that narcotic drug production, like many of the more legal jobs, has been outsourced. Obtaining the necessary ingredients became far more difficult in the U.S., even for small-scale and personal-use manufacturers. ### Conclusion: From Skeptic to Skittish In light of the above, there are some more or less unassailable inferences to be drawn: - Methamphetamine can indeed be cooked in a coffee carafe. - A small coffee maker can be used to make meth through the “Nazi method.” - Meth is sometimes cooked in motels or hotels. - It wouldn’t always be possible to look at a carafe and determine whether it was used to cook meth. That’s enough to make Wingo proceed with caution. He’s often on the road instructing law enforcement officials about combating meth. “I tell people in my classes that I don’t make coffee in my room,” Wingo said. When he’s in a hotel, he forsakes the convenience of the individual coffee maker and will instead go to the hotel lobby or cafe for his coffee. “That’s why I don’t take a bath [in hotels] anymore, because guess where all the chemicals were?” Wingo said. Personally, I went from skeptic to skittish regarding this story. Before researching for this article, I had a Grunge-Era image of meth and its production. I questioned whether it was possible to manufacture the drug in something as simple as a coffee maker. I now have very little doubt that somewhere, at some time, hotel-room coffee pots have been used for this purpose. I also assume, however, that it is an extremely rare occurrence that is becoming rarer with the decline of meth manufacture in the U.S. While trying to refrain from class snobbery, I also have a hunch this almost never happens in four-star hotels. I’m now paranoid enough that I’d go well out of my way for an alternative to a hotel-room coffee maker. I’m not quite paranoid enough to say never – unless, of course, those dark reddish-orange stains are on the coffee pot. Whether they’re caused by meth or not, avoiding anything in a container like that is just common sense. ### Resources [Think twice before using hotel room coffee pots](https://web.archive.org/web/20170613073547/http://www.waff.com/global/story.asp?s=5980064) – Story from 48 News in Northern Alabama.

# Coffee Jelly: Delicious Caffeinated Protein [Recipes](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/coffee-recipes/)---by [Ann Korman](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/ann-korman/)![Coffee Jelly: Delicious Caffeinated Protein](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/coffee-jelly-delicious-caffeinated-protein/coffee-gelatin-dessert650.jpg) ### Origins Coffee Jelly was invented after westerners introduced coffee to the Japanese. The Japanese people found new uses for the coffee plant, one of the best is coffee jelly. This fantastic combination of coffee and gelatin is served as dessert, or sometimes alongside liquid coffee. Individually, coffee and gelatin have wonderful health benefits. Combined together, coffee jelly is a nutritious snack or dessert.![Coffee Jelly](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/coffee-jelly450.DF6H2Vwc_1HczKy.webp)_Coffee Jelly Dessert_### Health Benefits of Coffee Studies have shown that drinking 2 to 5 cups of coffee daily can vastly improve your health. The natural caffeine in coffee contains serious health benefits. Coffee is good for: - Your Liver: Caffeine metabolizes in numerous ways that promote overall health. - Your Skin: Drinking three cups of coffee a day fights the most common form of skin cancer. In one study, women who drank three cups a day reduced their risk by 21%! - Your Brain: Aside from the short-term effects (better mood, more energy, sharper thinking), sustained coffee drinking has been shown to slow down the onset of Alzheimer’s. A Few Tips: - Only drink organic coffee. - Don’t overdo it! Too much of a good thing has negative effects. - Listen to your body, and it will tell you how much coffee you need. ### Health Benefits of Gelatin Gelatin is the building block of skin, hair, tendons, and bones. The proteins in Gelatin are beneficial in different ways than typical meat products. Gelatin helps: - Reduce Inflammation: Gelatin eases the inflammation of bodily tissues, allowing faster recovery from injury. - Manage weight: Gelatin strengthens the body at the cellular level, speeds up your metabolism, and eliminates surplus water, trimming excess weight! - Take gelatin with water, add it to soup, or use the following recipe to make super tasty Coffee Jelly. ### The Recipe You Will Need: - 2 cups freshly brewed organic coffee - 2 Tablespoons of cold water - 3 Tablespoons of sugar (more is ok!) - 1 Tablespoon Great Lakes Gelatin (personal favorite!)

# Coffee Internship on Kona Farm [Coffee Business](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/coffee-business/)---by [Gary Strawn](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/gary-strawn/)![Coffee Internship on Kona Farm](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/coffee-internship-on-kona-farm/Tired1.jpg)**2012 UPDATE:** INeedCoffee has received word that this particular coffee internship program is no longer active, but other internships on Hawaiian coffee farms are often available. > _Thank you for your interest in Kona Earth work exchange opportunities.  Unfortunately, we have stopped taking interns and do not have any positions available.  The following is old information that is no longer accurate.  For other possible intern opportunities on farms in Hawaii, check out the WWOOF Hawaii website.  You can also visit Kona Earth for more information about this discontinued program._> _Kona coffee farm, 13 acres, family owned with two kids and pets. This is not a hobby farm, it is a working, productive coffee farm. Work includes planting, pruning, weeding, fertilizing, light construction, equipment maintenance and whatever other jobs need to be done. We are only partially organic but farm as responsibly as possible. We ask for 30 hours of work per week in exchange for lodging and food. Contact us for more details and visit KonaEarth.com for lots of pictures and stories about life on the farm._ I recently gave a farm tour for a workshop about coffee farming. The class was attended by several Kona coffee farmers, some with quite a bit of farming experience. They didn’t believe me when I said I did all the work myself, and they unanimously decided that I needed some full-time help. Growing 13 acres of Kona coffee is just too much work for one person.![Tired farmer](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/Tired1.BzVNxM8D_1YvM85.webp) I tried to explain that I don’t do **all** the work myself – I hire out all the picking. Our coffee is picked by hand, which is very labor-intensive. The average picker can pick about 200 pounds of coffee cherries daily. A really good picker can pick up to 500 pounds in a day. I tried picking once. I picked as much as I could in a day but only got 40 pounds. So I don’t even try to pick coffee anymore; hiring a crew of professionals is my only choice. In addition to hiring pickers, I also hire help for some of the really large jobs like pruning. I do about half the pruning myself and hire a crew for the other half. I’ve hired temporary crews for things like pouring concrete and other large jobs that one person can’t do. For the most part, though, I do everything myself, and that’s way too much. The most obvious solution for us is to hire a full-time farmhand. I’m not sure we can afford it, and I don’t think I need quite that much help. I’d like to start with a part-time person and see if that’s enough. Many farmers have had good luck advertising in the local newspaper for part-time help. Trading living space for labor is fairly common. That certainly would be easier on our pocketbook, but we don’t really have room for a permanent resident on our property.![harvest coffee beans](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/coffee-beans60.IBm4FMpw_1xO2dq.webp) Another option is interns and other “unpaid” workers. There are several programs that help willing workers find host farms. Willing Workers On Organic Farms (WWOOF) is a popular program. Despite the name, the farm isn’t required to be certified organic. That’s good because there are a lot of farms that practice responsible farming but aren’t certified organic. There are plenty of applicants willing to work on a Kona coffee farm in Hawaii. Typically the WWOOFers will live on the farm for anywhere from a couple of weeks to several months. No prior farm experience is required, only a willingness to work and learn. There are nearly 100 hosts on this island. Many of the hosts are small organic farms advertising things like “holistic living,” “excellent vibes,” “tent provided,” and “shamanism welcome.” One host is actually an “international collective of circus performers” located one mile from a clothing-optional beach. We may seem like hard-nosed workaholics compared to some of the hosts. When looking for workers, I will certainly point out that we are not a hobby farm but a full-time working farm. I think it’s important that applicants know what they’re getting into. I don’t expect experienced workers, but I do expect individuals who are willing to get their hands dirty and learn about farming. I can’t teach much about “ecological mysticism” or “edible landscaping” but I can promise exposure to things like diesel tractor maintenance, barn construction, and all aspects of commercial coffee farming. We’ll probably ask for about 30 hours of work per week in exchange for a place to stay and food. I was afraid that it would be too harsh, but other farmers assured me that there are plenty of applicants willing to live in a tent and shower under a hose in exchange for working on a coffee farm in Hawaii. We’ll offer a room with lights, a flushing toilet, a hot shower, and even a little kitchen area (once construction is completed). Is that a fair trade for lots of hard work? I’m hoping someone will think so because I could really use the help. If you know anybody that might be interested, let us know and we’ll see if we can work something out.![room](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/Room.BzhITv1k_Z1M4azN.webp) ### Resources [Hawaiian Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/hawaiian-coffee/) – An island-by-island breakdown of Hawaiian coffee.

# Coffee Noir [Cafe Culture](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/cafe-culture/)---by [Barbara Schreibman](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/barbara-schreibman/)![Coffee Noir](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/coffee-noir/coffee-noir.jpg) FADE IN: A STARBUCKS IN MIDTOWN Waiting to order, SHE fidgets at the end of an unusually long, slow line, annoying the man in front of her. HE turns to her with a withering remark in mind, but liking what he sees, says instead – HE: Slow. SHE: Really slow. HE: Must be waiting for a messenger to get back with the beans. SHE: Then he must be coming from the Andes. HE: Tough trip for a bike messenger. She’s laughing now, taking a closer look at him; she’s interested, too. HE: Juan Valdez in spandex. SHE: Not a pretty picture. HE: Hey, I’m just reporting. Right now, he’s waiting in line at Customs. SHE: I understand what’s taking so long. HE: Sure. Poor guy is waiting for Customs, worrying about those narco dogs sniffing his beans, trying to keep his leg muscles loose so he can make all the lights on Ninth Avenue — you think it’s easy? SHE: Not easy at all. HE: Just so we can have coffee together. SHE: I take it that’s an invitation? HE: It is. SHE: You mean now? HE: Well, as soon as our hero gets back with the beans. SHE: Okay, sure — I’ve got a little time. HE: Great. The line continues to inch forward. Now that they’ve officially connected, they’re a bit self-conscious. There’s a brief silence, which he breaks in pompous tones: HE: There are some ground rules, of course. SHE: (not sure he’s joking) Oh? HE: First of all, no biscotti. SHE: No? HE: Definitely not. SHE: (carefully) Just coffee, then. HE: Oh, you can eat one — you can have six if you want — but just don’t call it…(pretentiously) “a biscotti.” SHE: Ah. HE: Call it what it is. SHE: Which is? HE: A big, stale cookie. A delicious big, stale cookie, but a big, stale cookie nonetheless. SHE: I see. HE: Let’s have a little truth in labeling here. Let’s call a spade a spade and an Oreo an Oreo! She laughs, is reassured, and relaxed again. HE: (impassioned) Let’s call a Fig Newton a Fig Newton! A Vanilla Wafer a Vanilla Wafer! SHE: You’re the king of truth-in-labeling. HE: I may be. In fact, I’m thinking of changing my name to “Tall Lawyer With A Rotator Cuff Problem.” SHE: That may be just a teeny bit unwieldy — HE: Hey, the truth and the whole truth. SHE: You know, you really had me going there — “no biscotti”! I mean, you meet so many lunatics. HE: (with feigned surprise) You do? She’s getting a bit flustered: SHE: You know what I mean — all those he-was-such-a-nice-quiet-boy ax murderers you read about. The first thing that went through my mind was, “Oh, God, I knew he was too good to be true…” HE: Well, I’m flattered. SHE: (regrouping) Don’t get carried away — you’re not perfect, you know. There’s that rotator cuff thing – Laughing, he looks around to see that they’re almost at the head of the line. HE: Looks like the beans made it out of Customs. What would you like? SHE: Black, please. HE: And? And? SHE: Oops — a big, stale thingy, of course. HE: Of course. He speaks to the waiting ORDER-TAKER: HE: Two large coffees, please — O.T.: Two Grandes. HE: (good-humoredly) If you must, and (gestures) two of those cookies — O.T.: Two Grandes, two biscotti. HE: I stand corrected. SHE: Well done, Tall Lawyer. You can change the world tomorrow. HE: I live in hope. Hey, why don’t you grab that nifty table over there while I take care of this? SHE: Sure. She takes possession of the designated table nearby — garnering furious looks from the next six people in line — and hears him receiving their order at the counter: HE: Thanks, and — wait a second: what’s this? O.T.: Two Gran — HE: I know what they are, I just expected them filled up. O.T.: They are — HE: (loudly) Not to the top, they’re not. At the table, she overhears the exchange and smiles a bit, waiting for the punchline: O.T.: Look, sir, I’m sorry, we’re supposed to leave some room — HE: (shouting) You’re supposed to cheat customers out of what they paid for, that’s what you’re supposed to do! O.T.: (stunned) Listen, sir — I’ll just fill them up and — HE: Oh, you’ll “just fill them up,” will you? Well, that’s not good enough! At the table, it’s suddenly clear to her — and to everyone else in the now-hushed room — that he’s quite serious: HE: (red-faced and bellowing) Where’s the manager of this schlock emporium! I DEMAND TO SEE THE MANAGER!!! O.T.: Sir, she’s — she’s coming, sir. As a woman in a suit hurries toward the order taker’s station, HE turns in triumph to their table. There is no one there.

# Coffee Pancakes [Recipes](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/coffee-recipes/)---by [Ligia Lugo](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/lugo-ligia/)![Coffee Pancakes](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/coffee-pancakes/Coffee-Pancakes-Recipe.jpg) Pancakes are popular and the most loved breakfast preparations for people of all age groups. These fluffy discs are a quick and easy food option that tastes great. But, having the same kind of flavorings day after day may make even fun food preparations, such as pancakes, boring and mundane too… Adding a variety of toppings may add an element of surprise, but creating a variation in the pancake recipe sounds more, doesn’t it? And, how about combining the two most loved breakfast preparations in one? We are talking about coffee and pancakes.![coffee pancakes](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/10-coffee-pancakes.ytuaNFUA_1t1r1C.webp) For this recipe, you simply need freshly ground coffee beans to add maximum aroma to your preparation, apart from basic pancake ingredients. You will be surprised how just by adding one simple ingredient, you can create such an interesting dish and get a break from the regular pancakes you are so used to having morning after morning! As shared earlier, the key to getting a great aroma in this dish is by using freshly ground coffee beans and for that, a manual coffee grinder comes in handy. This means, you just need a small and handy device to savor a decadent breakfast dish without burning a hole in your pocket. Now that we have made arrangements to get the best quality coffee grounds, let’s proceed with how we can create this amazing dish. ### Appliances - Manual coffee grinder - Large bowl - Spatula - Ladle - Cooking pan - Tablespoons ### Ingredients - 1½ tablespoons coffee grounds - ¾ cup all-purpose flour - 2 tablespoons powdered sugar - ¾ teaspoon baking powder - 1½ tablespoons vinegar - ½ cup milk - 2 tablespoons yogurt, beaten - 1 egg - 1 teaspoon butter - Honey, thick Greek yogurt, and sliced almonds, for garnish ### Directions 1. In a large bowl, add flour, powdered sugar, baking powder, and coffee grounds, and mix it all well.![mix Coffee pancakes](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/1-coffee-pancakes.n7KeYPj1_Z4JzcL.webp) 2. To this, add vinegar, milk, and yogurt. 3. Crack open the egg into the bowl and whisk everything well until no lumps are present and you see small bubbles rising at the top of the batter.![keep mixing](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/2-coffee-pancakes.CBJKWENR_14R3rT.webp)![mixed well](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/3-coffee-pancakes.CyN-uFPy_QxV7i.webp) 4. Heat a pan on medium flame and melt butter in it. 5. Now, add a ladleful of the pancake batter into the hot pan and cook it on low to medium heat until the bottom cooks to a light brown color. 6. Flip the pancake and cook the other side until light brown in color.![flip pancake](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/4-coffee-pancakes.B7SwOW4F_nWgrM.webp) 7. Repeat this process with the remaining batter. 8.

# Coffee Mugs of Coffee Fanatics [Cafe Culture](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/cafe-culture/)---by [Michael Allen Smith](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/michael-allen-smith/) In a recent CaffiNation podcast, INeedCoffee contributor Paul Rj Muller developed an idea based on the article “Caffeine Consumption By Coffee Fanatics.” In that article, several contributors shared their caffeine consumption levels. Paul’s idea is to share a photo of the mug we use to assist us in reaching our caffeine goals. Below are a few of the favorite mugs used by several listeners to the _Caffination Podcast_.**Michael Allen Smith, Seattle**> Since my drink of choice is espresso, my favorite _mug_ is a little demitasse. On it is a Edgar Degas painting of ballet dancers. This is so not my style. I received the set as a gift, which I fully expected to throw into storage. Then I noticed that I could pull my espresso shots directly into the cup. It’s been my favorite ever since. My favorite traditional coffee mug died on January 26th, 2000. That story is told in [Coffee Eulogy](https://ineedcoffee.com/a-coffee-eulogy/).![MAS espresso mug](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/mas-mug1.lwq9di-h_UBmdy.webp)**Paul Rj Muller, CaffiNation USA (Philadelphia)**> My Home mug is a hand thrown Stoneware mug from the Pennsylvania Renaissance Faire Circa 2001. It holds about two and a half 8oz cups of coffee. Its a pretty heavy mug even when empty so its harder to spill accidentally, which is good because I’m a clutz. This mug also has the special distinction of serving as a mic Stand on a couple of occasions when I needed an extra bit of height when recording.![caffination mug](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/caffination-mug-t.CULDZoS7_Z2rRbx3.webp)**David Richards**> I got this mug two years ago on a trip to Yellowstone. The bear paw and Yellowstone name drew me to the mug. I go to the park every few years and the mug is a daily reminder of the good times I have had there.![Yellowstone mug](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/MyMug-DRichards-tr.D_hAxE3C_ZFsJtm.webp)**Joe Wilson**> The two mugs in the photo are my two main mugs that I use at work. The one on the left, with the Blue Sun logo, is my normal mug. Blue Sun is a bit of an obscure geeky reference: it was the ubiquitous egacorp whose logo was prevalent in the background on Firefly. The other mug, I bought from the Japan pavilion at EPCOT Center, in Walt Disney World, on the night that I proposed to my fiance’. The character on the front means “harmony,” and it has an internal strainer inside for steeping loose tea.![joe wilson mugs](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/faderjockey_mugshot500.BQjqCm4s_SS2oG.webp)**Chris Arnold, San Diego**> Though I do not drink Starbucks or Gevalia coffee, these are my two most used mugs. The larger mug is for those marathon work sessions, and the smaller for my morning cup. I really like the Gevalia cup for it’s fluted lip, which I believe gives a better aroma when sipping, and and thus an enhanced taste. I don’t believe in thermal mugs, but prefer to keep the coffee in a glass lined, vacuum insulated thermal carafe, and just pour as needed into the cup. Preheating the cups with hot water is an absolute necessity in my household, as it allows the coffee to stay hotter longer in the cup. Same goes for the carafe.![chris arnold mugs](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/chris-arnold-mugs500.Lk8LakFG_Z17tu8M.webp) ### Resources [CaffiNation 195: The Grind](http://web.archive.org/web/20140407142816/http://www.caffination.com/podcast/caffination-195-the-grind-463/) – January 3, 2008, podcast.

# Coffee Price Economics [Coffee Business](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/coffee-business/)---by [John Carrier](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/john-carrier/)![Coffee Price Economics](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/coffee-price-economics/Coffee-C-Market-Price-Volatility.jpg) Coffee is an interesting thing. Aside from the aroma, flavor, and allure of a good cup, understanding some things about coffee economics can be its own interesting lesson. If nothing else, (the stunning economics lesson to follow) will hopefully help you understand some of the things that help determine the price of the coffee in your cup and possibly appreciate its value. So class, with caffeine-laden coffee close by (generally needed when discussing the science of economics) please open your macroeconomics textbook and we’ll jump right in … First, it’s important to realize that coffee is a globally traded commodity just like oil. Coffee is the second-most traded commodity, oil being the first. Coffee is generally traded in financial instruments known as futures contracts, and this is mainly done through the New York Board of Trade. A futures contract is a standardized contract to buy or sell a certain underlying instrument at a certain date in the future at a specified price. In the case of coffee, each futures contract involves the control of 37,500 pounds of green coffee (250 bags, which is what usually fits in a typical shipping container for overseas transport).![shipping containers](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/Shipping-Containers5001.lwxVgasw_Z1fo2Id.webp)_Shipping Containers_ The New York Board of Trade is the designated futures market and exclusive global marketplace for Coffee “C” futures contracts. In these futures and options contracts, the global price for coffee is discovered on any given day. Truly, the price of coffee is a daily, even minute-by-minute discovery process.![Trading floor at the New York Board of Trade](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/trading-floor-BOT.C-2bp5gw_rY3X5.webp)_Trading floor at the New York Board of Trade_ The “C” contract pricing is driven up and down by variables like changing weather conditions in the major producing countries, political turmoil, speculation about production levels, changing transportation costs (back to that pesky oil!), and other unexpected factors. That word “unexpected” is key. For example, news of a possible drought or freezing conditions in coffee-producing areas would likely reduce global supply and thereby increase prices. Assuming demand stays the same, the decreased supply would drive up prices in order to achieve a market-clearing price. The “C” looks at washed Arabica coffee produced in several Central and South American, Asian, and African countries to establish the “basis” for the contract. Coffees judged better are at a premium and naturally, those judged inferior are at a discount. Of course, this all primarily relates to green coffee prices. Roasted coffee, whether bought directly from a roaster, the grocery store, or in the form of a beverage, is a different product that has other factors affecting its ultimate price. Since coffee importers and large brokers primarily sell against replacement prices (the price to pay in order to replace coffee sold to end-consumers), similar to how gasoline vendors do, when the “C” goes up, so do coffee prices. These commodity markets can be quite volatile (referring to the magnitude of price movements), which is why you often see fairly significant moves in the price of gas at the pump. The same thing happens with green coffee when the variables affecting the market price get a little crazy. So, the prices coffee suppliers pay to make coffee available to consumers are greatly affected by the global coffee trade in the same way local gas prices are affected by the global oil market. The economic principles at work are the same whether the commodity in question is gasoline or coffee. For some perspective, I’ve included a graph of the history – back to 1994 – for the “C” historical monthly contract price as well as the monthly volatility just to show how much global coffee prices can fluctuate (data from [www.nybot.com](http://www.nybot.com)).![Coffee &quot;C&quot; Market Basis Price](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/Coffee-C-Market-Basis-Price.BJY3Wwlt_26AGMt.webp)_Coffee “C” Market Basis Price_![Coffee C Market Price Volatility](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/Coffee-C-Market-Price-Volatility.CM3bSrYV_ZiDGdn.webp)_Coffee C Market Price Volatility_ Coffee importers tend to price their green coffee based on the going market rate. However, as the coffee makes its way through the layers of middlemen, whether green coffee vendors supply home roasters or commercial roasters supply ready-to-brew products, the prices generally become more rigidly based. In other words, the coffee the end-consumer purchases doesn’t move around in price quite so much as the coffee exchanged at the earlier phases of the coffee delivery mechanism (at the export/import level). The market rate pricing method is naturally more transparent than the steady, rigid pricing. The coffee market can be very volatile, even over very short periods. However, expecting all coffee consumers to accept dramatic price fluctuations would likely be a very poor decision on the part of the coffee suppliers, particularly because people don’t like or accept rapid change all that well. Leaving coffee prices paid by end-consumers to fluctuate at market prices would no doubt lead to confusion and annoyance similar to what many people feel when stopping to fill up their vehicle with gas these days when the gas price changes are very obvious. Overall, there are many moving parts in the process of getting coffee off the farm and into your cup. Each part represents a unique and frequently changing price component as well. Even with all the moving parts and middlemen, the value of a fresh cup of coffee can be great – often well beyond the 15 cents or so that someone roasting their own coffee might spend to have a wonderful sensory experience. UPDATE: After this article was released, the New York Board of Trade (NY BOT) changed its name to ICE Futures U.S. (ICE). ### References ICE Futures U.S. – Formerly known as the New York Board of Trade (historical “C” futures contract pricing) Wikipedia, the Free Encyclopedia (photos used are in the public domain) Published on February 19, 2013--- #### John Carrier

# Coffee Tasseography – Fortune Telling with Coffee [Cafe Culture](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/cafe-culture/)---by [Margaret Wallauer](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/margaret-wallauer/)![Coffee Tasseography – Fortune Telling with Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/coffee-tasseography-fortune-telling-with-coffee/coffee-mug-saucer1.jpg) Did you know that your coffee cup holds clues about yourself, your present, and your future? Tasseography, sometimes called tasseomancy, is a branch of divination. It has been done for more than a thousand years in many areas of the world. The most common form of tasseography that is done today is tea leaf reading. Normally, I prefer to do tea leaf reading. I think that the tea leaves are a little bit bigger and it is a less messy process. Sometimes, however, people will specially request coffee-ground reading. Both work the same way: after drinking the liquid, the grounds of coffee or leaves of tea that are left behind in the cup create the symbols that, interpreted well, might be the psychic key to a person’s future. This activity requires at least two people. Although some people believe that they can read their own fortune, many do not. I don’t even bother trying to do my own. To me, it’s only entertaining as a group activity.![coffee cup ready](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/coffee_cup_ready1.Bhu6FgSF_Z1MJtun.webp)_Coffee Cup Grounds Fortune Reading_ Many people consider this an occult practice. Personally, I don’t think that there is anything supernatural or evil about it, but I also don’t recommend putting much faith in it either way. I advise that it be enjoyed as entertainment only. Please don’t make important decisions based upon fortune-telling of any kind. ### Setting up Choose the old-fashioned kind of coffee cup, similar to a teacup. It should be rather shallow and wide. You should choose a white or light-colored porcelain cup; never use a black mug. ### Preparing the Coffee Normally, by the time you drink your coffee, there are no grounds in your cup. So I’ll tell you how to go about preparing the coffee. Boil water. Use the same amount of coffee that you normally use. You should not attempt to do this with pre-ground, canned or instant coffee – the coffee will probably taste unbearable and you may end up drinking too many coffee grounds, leaving you with nothing to work with. Measure your coffee. 1 tablespoon for every 6 oz. of water is a good ratio, but you make it to your own taste. Boil the coffee on the stovetop. This doesn’t make the best tasting coffee, but if you don’t boil the coffee grounds, the grounds will float in your coffee cup and make it difficult for you to drink the coffee. Pour the coffee into the cup without filtering the coffee grounds. Most of the coffee grounds should settle to the bottom of the cup. If you don’t have enough to obscure the bottom of the cup, you can manually add a spoonful of grounds from the coffee pot into the cup. Add sugar and milk to taste. You can stir the drink as much as you’d like. This will stir up the grounds, but they’ll re-settle on the bottom of the cup a moment later. ### Drinking the Coffee Drink the coffee and enjoy a good conversation. As you near the bottom of the cup, try not to swallow the grounds. You can use your lips as a sieve to strain the coffee. One technique that I recommend is to try to stay ahead of the coffee grounds. When you are trying to consume the last of the liquid, turn the coffee cup slowly while you are drinking so that you can strain the liquid from the grounds. Drink as much of the liquid as possible. ### The Ritual People seem to like a certain amount of ritual to their entertainment, so I’ve created one, although I don’t think that it is required. After drinking the liquid, I have the subject turn the coffee cup over onto the saucer, then turn the coffee cup three times to the right. The subject should then put his or her hands on the cup and make a wish.![Margaret reading](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/Margaret_reading.BlCNppLg_Z1FXKhn.webp)_Margaret reading the coffee grounds_### Vibes Part of “fortune-telling” in general, and coffee cup reading in particular, is tuning in to the “vibes” of the subject. For me, it’s a pulsing of my blood and a feeling of warmth, as if a wave is running through my arm. If you don’t feel anything, you might try to jumpstart the process. Ask the subject to concentrate on his/her wish, and to send that message to you through his/her arm and hand into your body. ### Symbols and Significance The interpreter (or psychic, as the case may be) should hold the cup in one hand, and hold the left or right hand of the subject. The interpreter will be looking for images in the coffee grounds. The process is similar to gazing at clouds and “seeing” symbols and images in your mind’s eye. When I read a person’s cup for the first time, I usually see some sort of a tree. Sometimes it is an oak, sometimes a willow or palm. I interpret this to be the person’s tree of life. A heavy root structure (or lack of it) tells me that about the person’s relationship with the family. Sometimes I’ll see a tree that leans to one side or that is lopsided, indicating that the subject is concentrating too much energy in one area of his/her life. Other symbols can be interpreted, with varying significance. I usually use my imagination and past experiences to interpret the symbols. Here is a (very) shortlist of my interpretation of some common symbols. - **Apple**: Fertility and creativity. - **Arch**: Money in business matters. - **Bread**: Nurture your desires, hopes, and dreams. - **Bridge**: A major decision needs to be made – which way should you go? - **Camera**: Someone is attracted to you. - **Coins**: Money is on the way. - **Diamonds**: A marriage proposal is expected? If the person is married, this may be a symbol of money and material wealth. - **Flowers**: Flowers indicate happiness. - **Genie Lamp**: Your wish will be granted. - **Harp**: Traditional romance. - **Heart**: A love affair, if the heart is broken or misshapen then the person is broken-hearted. - **Knots**: Concern over something, take care that it does not negatively affect your health. - **Road**: Creative opportunities are bringing you to another level. - **Ship**: A business opportunity is presenting itself. ### Meaning and Time Not all cups tell the future. If the subject is wary of “fortune-telling,” the cup will be a general cup, and often the cup will be general if this is the first reading for the subject. Sometimes too, the cup may not be about what will actually happen, it will instead reflect what the subject wants or fears will happen in the near future. If the cup holds overwhelmingly negative symbols: symbols of death and treachery, the cup is probably a manifestation of the subject’s fears, not what will actually happen. If the cup is about the future, however, the placement of the image in the cup is important to understand. I believe that the cup relates to only about 4 months into the future. The images at the bottom of the cup relate to something that is farther away, while the rim represents the present time. ### Conclusion I don’t believe that events are predetermined; I think that people make their own reality and future based upon a series of everyday actions and decisions. The reading merely represents an opportunity for the subject to examine the way that subject spends his/her energy. Thus, fortune-telling gives the subject insight into him/herself in a new way. Your coffee clutch will really enjoy this fun little exercise, and it can start some unusual discussions that give you great insight into the hopes, dreams, concerns, and fears of friends.

# Coffee Process From Plant to Roast [Coffee Business](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/coffee-business/)---by [Allen J Pais](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/allen-j-pais/)![Coffee Process From Plant to Roast](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/coffee-process-from-plant-to-roast/Coffee-Process-From-Plant-to-Roast.jpg) This article will serve as a basic guideline for the different stages a coffee plant goes through as it makes its way from plant to ready for roasting. Depending on your climatic condition and elevation, you can expect your picking time to be 7-9 months from the date of your first blossom. This will happen after you have picked your coffee, pruned your plant, and experienced the first rain with a substantial blossom._Note: The blossom to picking dates may differ between various countries, we have typical experience between India and Queensland, Australia._![Coffee bean cycle](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/coffee-cycle.CVTGN6ph_X8BNF.webp) ### Coffee Bean Plant to Cup Cycle #### #1 Blossom The blossom takes place in the month of February or March each year in countries like India and lasts for 3 to 4 days. The sight of blossom is beautiful with the plants covered in lovely white flowers that are fragrant.![coffee plant blossom](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/coffee-plant-1.DEFePlzQ_Zv2TyW.webp) #### #2 Green Cherry formation The blossom flowers after pollination will then slowly turn into small green cherries in the month of April or May and then will start growing into firm green cherries. During this time the coffee farmer will be pruning his plants. The pruning method is to remove only the non-productive parts of the plant so as to divert the energy into the productivity parts. Overgrown trees will have a few branches cut to provide the plant with sunlight. Weeding and manuring will be carried out during this time when the soil is moist after a few showers. Arabica farmers will be berry borer tracking during this time. Coffeeberry borer is an insect that lives in a coffee cherry and has to be eliminated. Robusta is less subjective to berry borer attacks.![green coffee cherry](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/coffee-cherry-2.DDq8RZuF_Qafpe.webp) #### #3 Orange Cherry Formation The green cherry will start changing its color into orange-pinkish in the month of June to August. During this time the coffee farmer will be weeding around the plants and de-suckering. De-suckering can be done twice a year, which is the removal of branches arising from the main trunk. Coffee farmers will take this opportunity to plant new plants all around where there is sufficient space to protect the plants with mild shade.![orange coffee cherry](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/coffee-cherry-3.Lv5JiSlc_Z2gR40o.webp) #### #4 Red Cherry Formation Gradually the cherry will turn into a blood-red color in the month of September to November. During this time the coffee farmer will continue with centering work, borer tracking (Arabica plants), weeding, and manuring. The centering method is the removal of the vegetative growth up to a 15 cm radius from the center and up to the first notch of all primary branches.![red coffee cherry](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/coffee-cherry-4.BzeEwYPk_1D7UyA.webp) #### #5 Coffee Cherries ready for harvesting During the months of December to January, the coffee cherry will be fully ripe and ready to pick. This is the time the coffee farmer will be busy preparing for picking by continuing to weed the area so it is clear to start picking.![Coffee Cherries](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/coffee-cherry-5.Dmw4IiRg_Z1GFIow.webp) #### #6 Wet pulping Once picking has been completed the coffee farmer has to decide how he will process the picked coffee beans. He can use the dry method or the wet pulping method. The dry method uses the sun to dry the coffee cherry. Wet pulping is the other option. Wet pulping is mechanized and the process is faster than sun drying. The disadvantage of sun drying is the bean loses weight. The advantage of the wet method of pulping is a higher weight but it is more expensive than sun drying due to the motorized equipment used in the pulping process.![wet pulp coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/coffee-cherry-6.BQHzCU2b_weL4g.webp) #### #7 Sun-drying coffee beans After the cherry skin has been separated from the bean manually, washed and the slimy coating is removed, the bean is sun-dried for 2 to 3 days on a clean surface. In large-scale pulping, the washing of the bean is part of the pulping process. Each day the beans have to be either covered or removed to a shaded area so that the dew moisture does not get into the coffee bean. After three days, the coffee beans are ready for removal and storage.![Sun drying coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/coffee-green-7.rj237kXF_h1n2f.webp) #### #8 Hand milling-removing of the parchment cover from the bean Once drying is complete, the next step is hulling. This process removes a thin membrane on the bean known as parchment. The parchment can be removed manually by using a pestle & mortar manually by gently rotating the pestle over the beans. This process is mechanized on a large scale and is done faster in large quantities, under the process of hulling.![coffee ready](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/coffee-green-8.B0_2A_YW_Z2ox7N0.webp) #### #9 Ready for Roasting Once the coffee beans are polished (Milling) and clean, they are ready for roasting. ### Article Video [Coffee Process Method](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZokSPwn28N8) (YouTube 6 minutes) ### Last Words I hope you all have enjoyed this article.

# The Popper Crop: Coffee Roasting Popcorn Poppers [Roasting Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/roasting-coffee/)---by [Sam Hampton](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/sam-hampton/)![The Popper Crop: Coffee Roasting Popcorn Poppers](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/coffee-roasting-popcorn-poppers/orville-r.jpg) Just the mention of a West Bend Poppery or Poppery 2 sent shivers up my spine when I first started to look for poppers in which to roast coffee. The information I surveyed on the internet seemed to point only in one direction. One could roast in other poppers, but if you did not roast in the proper popper you were either from Missouri or just plain backward. As I started to seriously study the roasting blogs and the results people were getting with other popcorn popper roasters, the shivers diminished. I slowly came to realize that most of the WB Poppery articles were written a few years ago when the good, old, proper poppers were still readily available. Contrary to the advice of Tom of Sweet Maria’s, some folks were using the bottom-hole poppers and getting great roast results. I tried using a few and learned by trial and error what had to be done to get them to work. I also started a search for all the poppers that were available in the current market at the local thrift stores and at a cost of fewer than ten dollars. Many vintage poppers are available on eBay, and they have an average price of around $50.00. If I had been sure of what I needed and how to roast coffee, the price would have been a bargain. Since I was just learning to roast, I could not justify the expense. I decided to see what I could buy in a two-month period for fifty dollars._Below are the results of eight weeks of hunting (July, August, and September 2014) for a suitable coffee roasting popcorn popper._### The Popper Crop 1. **Hamilton Beach Popaire 2** $3.99 at Saver’s 1250 watts 7/15/2014, used, $4.00, screen bottom in chamber 4.5”, Modified: by-passed thermostat and fuse 2. **West Bend** at Saver’s $4.00 Model 309H or 5209 1450 watts 7/22/2014, near new, $4.00, solid chamber 4.5”, Modification None: Very Good Roaster 3. **Pesto PopCornNow Plus** at Salvation Army $3.50 Model 482004 1440 watts 7/24/2014, near new, $3.50, center hole, chamber 4.5”, Modifications None: Great Corn Popper 4. **Presto Orville Redenbacher** at Goodwill $4.00 Model 4821 1440 watts 7/25/2014, new in box, $4.00, center hole, chamber 4.5”, Modified: screen in the chamber, by-passed thermostat and fuse 5. **Presto Hot Air Popper “Little Red” Model** 4848 $4.00 1240 watts Steven’s Creek Thrift Store 7/25/2014, new in box, $4.00, center hole, chamber 3.5”, Modified: separated the main coil from fan and coil, two plugs 6. **Nostalgia** at Saver’s $6.00, 1040 watts, 8/4/2014, near new, $6.00, solid chamber 4.5”, Modifications none: slung popcorn all over 7. **WindMere**, Saver’s Redwood City, $7.00, 8/12/2014, new in box, $7.00, solid chamber 3.5”, Modified: by-passed thermal fuse and thermostat 8. **West Bend Poppery 2**, 1200 watts, $7.00 at Saver’s SJ 7/22/2014, very used, $7.00, solid chamber 4.5” Modified: separated the main coil from fan and coil, two plugs 9. **Sunbeam 5052**, Savers SJ, $5.00, 1200 watts, 8/25/2014, near new, $5.00, solid chamber 3.5”, Modified: removed chamber thermostat 10. **Rival PP25**, 1200 watt at Salvation Army, $2.99, 8/27 (had no top for popper), new (no lid), solid chamber 4.5”, Modifications: Removed the bi-metal tab from the thermostat. This unit is as good as the WB Poppery 2. Total Cost of All Poppers: $47.50. All of the poppers above will roast coffee. Most will roast without modification. From the listing above, you can see that some poppers have to be modified to roast coffee. If the popper has a thermostat on the inside chamber wall, more than likely it will have to be removed. Popcorn only needs about 350 degrees F to pop. Coffee needs to get up to about 480 degrees F to roast. Some poppers have a thermostat in the circuit above the heating coils, if the thermostat trips to cut short your roast, the bi-metal disk has to be removed. If the popper overheats and the thermal fuse blows, it will need to be bypassed or replaced. A router speed control can give you control over the roasting time by lowering the speed of the fan and the heat from the heater coil. More complicated modifications can split the fan and heating coils into two separate circuits and independently control each to give still more roasting control. These modifications take more experience to use and achieve a good coffee bean roast. When choosing a popper, attention should be given to the depth of the roasting chamber, doing so can save you from the blowout problems. A chamber that is 4.5 inches deep will normally roast 90 grams of green beans and have enough room for the roasted beans to expand without blowing out of the popper. A 3.5-inch chamber is more than likely going to need a soup can chimney extender to keep the beans from blowing out. A chimney extender is an empty soup can with both ends cut out and placed on top of the roasting chamber. I made a custom extender out of aluminum flashing that allows my thermometer to be placed on the inside wall of the roasting chamber. I added a chaff catcher made from screen wire to fit on top of the aluminum extender. It works very well and makes cleanup a lot easier. ### Learning To Roast With any new popcorn roaster one uses to roast coffee, you have to learn to use it. If the beans do not move when you put them in the roasting chamber, stir them with a wooden spoon or use fewer beans. If the temperature rise is slow, partially cover the top of the roasting chamber. Carefully observe the beans. Look on the internet for answers to your roasting problems and adapt your techniques to get the very best out of your new popper. No modifications were necessary at first for roasting with the Rival PP25. But in time, the popper thermostat did start to shut off the popper after a roast. This can be avoided by allowing time in between the batches or cooling the popper by placing it in front of a fan for a few minutes between roasts. I solved this problem by removing the bi-metal tab on the thermostat. If you remove the bi-metal safety tab, just remember that **YOU** are now the safety feature of the roaster. Safety precautions and procedures are now in your domain for the safe operation of the roaster. ### Maintenance An occasional cleaning and vacuuming of the roaster chamber will reduce the collection of chaff debris in the fan and heating elements. Disassembly and inspection of the heating and fan elements should also be performed periodically. ### The Wacky One Star Popper One thing I have come to notice about popcorn popper reviews is that the worst popcorn poppers may make the best coffee bean roasters; for example, the Rival PP25 I purchased for $2.99 was lampooned by an eBay reviewer as the worst popcorn popper ever made. Another reviewer said you needed to wear body armor to use this popper, as it slung hot popcorn kernels all over the kitchen and scared the dickens out of the dog. Any popper that can do that is made for roasting the heavier green coffee beans. The Rival PP25 I purchased did not have a top cover, so I got a little extra discount. I did not need the top cover as I use the poppers without a top cover. I imagine that was why the new popper was donated to a thrift store, as it could not be sold without the top cover and measuring cup. It was brand new but had no box. I have learned to shop very slowly when looking for poppers. The Rival PP25 was on a top shelf and did not look like a popcorn popper. I passed by it several times and started to leave the store, but my curiosity pulled me back, and I picked up the unit. I had assumed it was some kind of facial mister since it did not have the classic popper top and was surrounded by hair dryers. I was surprised when it turned out to be a popcorn popper. I enquired about the top and got a discount because it was missing. Getting back to the reviews on the Rival PP25, there was not one positive review on this popper. Hot popcorn all over the kitchen was the cry. This popper works as good as or better than the West Bend Poppery 2. A powerful fan with 1200 watts will move 90 grams of green coffee from start to finish very proficiently. It confirmed my suspicions that the worst hot popcorn-throwing poppers make the best coffee bean roaster. Take what you read in reviews with a grain of salt; it might just savor your coffee roasting. I consider the Rival PP25 as one of the four best poppers I have. The Popaire2, the West Bend 5209, and the West Bend Poppery 2 rank up there with it. All four poppers work without modification. Getting past the second crack and wanting more control over the roasting time and temperature would be the only considerations for modifying these poppers. ### The Top Four Poppers in My Crop My favorite will probably always be the Popaire 2. It was my first good find and led me to many successful roasts. The West Bend poppers are without a doubt great coffee bean roasters. The Rival is right up there with them. These poppers are worth the investment of time and money to acquire and get a good roast. The payoff is in many good cups of freshly brewed coffee that easily fit into your lifestyle. Roasting coffee should be a joy, not a burden.![popaire 2](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/popaire2.BkP50Hyy_ZolC24.webp)_Popaire 2_![West Bend Poppery 2](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/west-bend-poppery-2.BthuZuxK_1M5LyF.webp)_West Bend Poppery 2_![west bend 5209](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/west-bend-5209.3wKbTsyG_Zjw6vV.webp)_West Bend 5209_![rival pp25](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/rival-pp25.DM-Fkiza_1Ab8p9.webp)_Rival PP25_### Three Strong Contenders![Sunbeam 5052](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/sunbeam-roaster.DfVsKRrE_AMoHX.webp)_Sunbeam 5052 has a 3.5” chamber_![windmere](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/windmere.DC2ESMya_2cSdgN.webp)_WindMere has a 3.5” chamber_![nostalgia](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/nostalgia.DSLYMH0i_1J4l5l.webp)_Nostalgia_ The only drawback to the Sunbeam and WindMere is the depth of the roasting chamber. A chimney extender is needed to keep the beans from blowing out. The same goes for the Nostalgia; even though it has a deeper chamber, the fan is very strong and popcorn flies all over the place. With a little ingenuity and modification, these poppers will perform many good roasts and produce coffee that will make you wonder why you did not start roasting sooner. ### Hole in the Bottom of the Roasting Chamber![presto hot air popper](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/presto-hot-air-popper.DaKXnzPs_Z2etaTX.webp)_Presto Hot Air Popper “Little Red” has a 3.5” chamber_![presto popcornnow](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/presto-popcornnow.j9RnIio5_1IDQ7i.webp)_Presto PopCornNow Plus_![orville Redenbacher](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/orville-r.JZm3cA5M_Z1FvYDh.webp)_Presto Orville Redenbacher_ The three poppers above are on the most “NOT RECOMMENDED” lists for roasting coffee. The Orville Redenbacher is just about identical to the Presto PopLite and both are really strong coffee roasters. I did a modification to the Orville Redenbacher popper by adding a screen to the bottom of the roasting chamber to prevent scorching the beans in early roasting. I was trying to roast too many beans; scorching could be minimized by roasting only 90 grams. The Presto “Little Red” was modified by separating the fan from the main heating coil. The alteration works perfectly. It is a great popper with both fan and heat control if used in conjunction with a router control and dimmer switch. The PopCornNow popper has a different heating element and fan unit than the PopLite and Orville Redenbacher poppers but performs the roasting function with style. I have limited coffee roasting experience with the PopCornNow as a coffee roaster; it is so good at popping corn, we designated it to the corn popping role exclusively. ### Temperature Is a Bonus to a Roasting Profile I am absolutely opposed to modifications or drilling holes in anything unless it is absolutely necessary. I use a thermometer to judge how well my beans are roasting. I made a small wooden jig to hold my pocket thermometer in the chamber when I started roasting. I got a better temperature registering system using a multi-meter with a digital readout. The type K probe makes it easier to keep the probe in the chamber and is much more accurate than a one-inch pocket thermometer. Making a hanger for a K probe only requires an old wire coat hanger. It is easy to attach before roasting and to detach before dumping when the roast is over.![multi meter](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/multi-meter.D78T62AG_Zo7yxP.webp)_Multi-meter with K probe attached_![k type temp probe](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/k-type-temp-probe.0pK8gjxX_2cwnEq.webp)_K type temperature probe attached to wire clip_![chimney made from flashing](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/chiney-made-from-flashing.mZAWJJEp_Z1mjsIF.webp)_Chimney made from flashing bottom_![wire clip](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/wire-clip.DZC-aew9_Z1iVJQq.webp)_Wire clip with K-type probe in the roast chamber_ When I look back at this collection, I have stopped shivering. Many good roasters are on the market and readily available for a nominal cost today. My $50.00 was well spent, but hold on a second. I still have $2.50 left in my budget. Does anyone know where I could pick up a West Bend Poppery 1 for $2.50? Happy roasting, and thanks for your attention.

# Coffee Roasts: Notes from a Non-Roaster [Roasting Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/roasting-coffee/)---by [Java Goddess](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/java-goddess/)![Coffee Roasts: Notes from a Non-Roaster](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/coffee-roasts-notes-from-a-non-roaster/coffee-roast-level-4.jpg) I’m going to rant and rave a little bit here… The best way to judge a coffee roast is with your own eyes. There is no real uniformity in terminology associated with roast colors. Coffee culture evolved simultaneously around the world and no two French Roasts developed with the same exact darkness. Until recently there has never been a definitive chart to say, to what color or roast degree, a roast of a certain name must subscribe to. The Specialty Coffee Association of America (SCAA), in an effort to add some uniformity to the industry, has put out a roast color chart. But that doesn’t affect the brand new roaster who knows what they used to drink in a little Cafe in France and starts roasting a medium dark French Roast, nor does it affect the old time family-owned roaster who never even heard of the SCAA. If they have a coffee that has been their Italian Roast for 50 years, then it doesn’t matter if the proper name of said roast on the SCAA chart is French or Viennese or Full City or whatever, it’s still Italian Roast to them. So the confusion isn’t likely to dissipate soon. This isn’t anyone’s fault and shouldn’t be cause for consternation. It just means you’ll have to look at the Roasts of your neighborhood coffee joint and figure out for yourself if their French or their Italian is darker. ### Impressions of the Names and the Roasts Some of the darkest roasts I’ve ever seen are simply burnt, resembling charcoal more than coffee beans. If the beans are black with no oils on the surface I call it Burnt Roast – no matter what the roaster calls it. ### Darkest Roasts The best examples of the Darkest Roasts are very shiny and oily and might as well be called black in color. They are often called Full City Roast, Italian Roast, or Viennese Roast (and sometimes even French Roast). These beans are almost black and if they go too far (read – roast too long) they lose the oils completely and just look like burnt carbon, bean-shaped material (see above). A lot of new roasters let this happen, thinking only that dark is what’s “in.”![coffee-roast-level-8](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/coffee-roast-level-81.Cpy3g7t0_Z1au7uD.webp) ### French Roast or Viennese Roast or Full City Roast The next level down is most often known as French Roast. With a bean surface that’s oily but less shiny, the beans are close to black but are more often an extremely dark brown. In some circles, this is referred to as a Viennese Roast or a Full City Roast. Many consumers wrongfully believe French Roasts to be the darkest available and in some places, it is, so the web of confusion just gets deeper and deeper.![coffee-roast-level-7](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/coffee-roast-level-7.DEkFOSV4_1ur9mp.webp) ### Medium-Dark Roasted or City Roast A Medium-Dark Roasted coffee is sometimes called City Roast or just Dark Roast. These beans are slightly oily and dark brown in color. This seems to me to be one of the best-tasting roasts, as it has the taste of a dark roast, but isn’t dark enough to have burned away the flavor characteristics of the particular bean.![coffee-roast-level-6](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/coffee-roast-level-6.B0slDeE6_Zkpabk.webp) ### Medium Roast A Medium Roast is a rich brown color, somewhere between dark chocolate and milk chocolate. I’ve also seen these called Half City Roast.![coffee-roast-level-4](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/coffee-roast-level-4.iEvf5lFd_1EY6n4.webp) ### Light Roast or American Roast or Cinnamon Roast A Light Roast is like the color of Milk Chocolate or lighter. Sometimes this is called American Roast or Cinnamon Roast. This is the Roast most often used for cupping (tasting) coffee samples, the general consensus being that the darker the Roast the more of the bean’s taste profile that is lost.![coffee-roast-level-3](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/coffee-roast-level-3.CH6x-NVt_Z1OVdqT.webp) I’m not a Roaster, I’m just a picky coffeehouse owner. I use 7 different Roasters to supply my needs. That’s how I first became aware of the disparity between the names and colors of Roasts. It has since become a little sideline study of mine wherever I go to note the differences in Roast name and Roast color from one cafe to the next. To do an adequate job of roasting coffee one only needs some green beans and a roaster. To do a great job, one needs an awareness of the chemical changes the bean is going through, a good ear to listen for the different “pops,” and a creative touch. Coffee is a science and an art. Science is logical, art is subjective. ### Resources [The Home Roaster Color Chart](https://ineedcoffee.com/the-home-roaster-color-chart/) – An 8-color chart of different coffee roast levels.

# Coffee Roundtable – Our Starbucks Idea [Coffee Business](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/coffee-business/)---by [Michael Allen Smith](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/michael-allen-smith/)![Coffee Roundtable – Our Starbucks Idea](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/coffee-roundtable-our-starbucks-idea/starbucks-super-auto-espresso.jpg) I just saw a news story about Starbucks asking its customers for ideas to be a better company. Well, good ideas are no fun if you can’t share them with your friends. So I asked a few of our contributors to pitch their ideas on how they would fix Starbucks. Below are some Starbucks ideas from some of our contributors.**Winter, StarbucksEverywhere** Winter is a computer programmer and the subject of [Starbucking](https://ineedcoffee.com/starbucking-honest-artistry/), a documentary that chronicles his mission to visit every Starbucks in North America. He has visited more than 7,800 company-owned Starbucks locations worldwide, including 7,190 (91 percent) of the active Starbucks cafes in North America. 1. Curtail store growth. The announcements about cutting back on new store openings and closing 100 stores are positive, but Starbucks can go further. When I start to encounter a multitude of baristas who do not know what a “short” coffee is, that is a sign that store growth might be affecting the company’s ability to hire and train quality staff. 2. Since music has become almost as important to Starbucks as coffee, the company should allow baristas more control over what is played in the stores. Sure, guidelines need to be in place to ensure that customers are not offended by explicit lyrics, for example, but if there is only one customer in the store, what is the harm in letting the baristas play what the customer wants to hear? 3. The recent announcement of closing 45 licensed locations in the West was a great sign. Starbucks should go further in closing down licensees who are not up to standards and severely curtail the granting of new licenses that dilute the brand. 4. Don’t be evil. Starbucks should start playing nicer and stop being so rabid about pursuing trademark infringement cases on any name or logo that might resemble Starbucks.**Ryan Jacobs, Columbus**1. Use cups that don’t routinely leak around the lid due to bad seals. I have no idea why this is a problem with Starbucks, but it doesn’t seem to be the case with other places. 2. Ensure that all Starbucks locations are complete Starbucks operations. A Starbucks in the grocery or Target is misleading and lowers the bar for true operations. Fix them or shut them down. The same goes for selling your beans in groceries or even your store with expiration dates six months past the roasting date. 3. Hire some of McDonald’s masters to streamline your cafes and develop consistent plans. They are the masters of consistency and efficiency. 4. Narrow the focus of your ideas site. Baristas donating kidneys, while a nice gesture, has little to do with the quality of my beverage. Paying people to sort through this cruft is not the best use of resources.**Michael Allen Smith, Seattle** Although I could probably write a book on things I’d like to change about Starbucks, I will list two easy ideas. 1. Stop serving espresso in tall cups with lids. Not only is it a waste of paper, but the drink also gets cooled too fast. Instead, use those little sample cups that nobody can ever seem to locate. 2. Better quality tea. I know the immediate goal is to improve the coffee. Believe it or not, your tea quality is in worse shape than your coffee. Peets, Coffee Bean, and Tea Leaf have much better tea. This means pitching that Tazo tea dust for real loose-leaf tea. Be sure to include at least one oolong tea. And while you are at it, do some research on the proper brewing temperature of the tea. I can assure you it is not boiling. 3. Don’t offer Free WiFi. Free attracts freeloaders. People arrive early, buy maybe one drink, and then camp out all day. Other customers quickly learn there are no places to sit among the sea of laptops and stop coming.![loose leaf tea](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/loose-leaf-tea1.BYNIpJLe_Z2e37cb.webp)_Offering better tea is an easy fix._**Paul Rj Muller, CaffiNation USA (Philadelphia)**1. Ditch the malformed sizing information. Call a small a small. Put it on the menu. Have small, medium, large, and extra if you really need to. Even McDonald’s shifted back from a large being a medium. Or, as a compromise, stick to one language when detailing sizing information. 2. Stop suggesting that a cappuccino can be made correctly as anything more than a 6-oz serving. It isn’t possible to froth the milk to that volume for long enough to create a true cappuccino, anything bigger than a tall is a milky coffee. 3. Please rethink what you call iced coffee. It should only consist of ice and coffee. This faux pas extends to all major chains. I’m looking at you, Dunkin Donuts. What you are serving is an Iced latte with milk in it. As someone who drinks coffee black, I can’t get a decent true iced coffee without ordering a black coffee and a cup of ice. Try two menu items: Iced Coffee and Iced Lattes. Everyone wins. 4. Remove the small mall kiosks, the people you hire there tend to trend more towards the teenager looking for a nighttime gig, and his buddies always hang out near the condiments. (I sound like an old man…) 5. Perhaps deploying five stores in three blocks isn’t a good idea.**Chris Arnold, San Diego**1. Get rid of the super-autos, and train their people to be REAL baristas. It’s called investment. 2. Get more comfy chairs and sofas. There is always someone hogging the one soft purple chair that I desire. 3. Have some smaller, specialty single-origin beans freshly roasted onsite to accompany the Clover machines. 4. Please change the names of the cup sizes to Small, Medium, and large so I don’t have to learn Latin to order. 5. Reduce the variations on Commuter mugs being sold by 6 or 7. It might save some landfill space. 6. Sell some real espresso machines and grinders, not those colorful things that belong in a toy chest. 7. Tell us exactly what is inside the “Breakfast Blend”. I loathe ambiguity.![starbucks super auto machine](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/starbucks-super-auto-espresso.Cee9iH6r_Z1DgoGd.webp)_These super-auto machines produce tasteless espresso.

# Coffee Storage Tips [Brewing Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/brewing-coffee/)---by [Ryan Jacobs](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/ryan-jacobs/)![Coffee Storage Tips](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/coffee-storage/coffee-storage-tips.jpg) Imagine the following scenario: You have just come home from your favorite coffee shop with two pounds of Jamaica Blue Mountain Coffee, freshly roasted. Normally, you wouldn’t buy so much at one time, but it was a steal at $20 a pound! Realizing that you won’t be able to drink this within a week, you must find a better place to store your highly prized (and priced) coffee to best preserve its flavor. What will you do? This particular situation is one where your coffee will have both long-term and short-term storage needs. ### To Freeze or Not To Freeze Oftentimes, it would be suggested to store your coffee in the freezer. After all, at colder temperatures, molecular activity (including flavor molecules migrating) slows down, right? This is true. But does slowing molecular migration down preserve the flavor of the coffee? Not necessarily. You see, there are other variables at work in a freezer. - A frozen environment will allow water molecules to attach to the coffee beans and/or packaging. - A freezer has other flavor molecules floating around in it (remember that fish sale 3 weeks ago?) - A freezer door opens and closes very often under normal use.![oxo coffee container airtight](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/oxo-coffee-container-airtight.CaQvq1l6_20WEqO.webp)_OXO Good Grips Airtight Coffee POP Container_### What does this mean for your coffee? This means that water will contact the surface of the bean, and ice will form. When the water melts, that water will find its way into the porous bean, and the bean will begin to deteriorate the quality of the coffee. Secondly, you should keep in mind that roasted coffee is porous. This is the property of coffee that allows roasters to make Hazelnut flavored coffee. (It isn’t grown that way.) So, if you put your Jamaican Blue Mountain coffee in the freezer, it needs to be well protected against the possibility of tasting like liquid salmon. ### Wrap It Up Your goal should be to keep the coffee’s contact with water to a minimum. Moreover, the coffee should thaw only once – right before it is brewed. I would suggest keeping the beans in the original packaging. Then, place the package in a zippered storage bag. You can draw out the excess air by using a straw to suck out the air while you close the bag. If you do not have a zippered bag, you can wrap the beans using plastic wrap. I use even more layers! After this initial wrapping, I place the coffee bean bundle in another paper bag. Again, wrap the bag with plastic wrap, then I cover it with foil. It may sound like overkill, but it is worth it. If you’ve invested money in this gourmet coffee, you need to protect your investment. ### Freezing, In A Nutshell Freezing coffee is applicable for storage of coffee that won’t be used within 1-2 weeks of roasting. It is not optimal for everyday use. ### No Refrigerators! If you are wondering about the refrigerator, it is a no-no for coffee. Since the temperature is generally around 37 degrees, the water that is inside doesn’t freeze. It is a cold mist that lingers on the coffee and there are even more scents and flavor molecules floating around. Liquid water is coffee’s worst enemy during storage. Under no circumstance would I ever recommend using the refrigerator for storing coffee. ### Room Temperature Storage Storing coffee at room temperature is the most convenient method of storage. It works well for coffee that will be consumed within one to two weeks of purchase. ### Eliminate The Negative When storing at room temperature certain environmental factors are minimized and eliminated if possible. - Oxygen - Water - Excessive Heat - Direct Sunlight - Other flavors All of these factors will destroy the coffee’s flavor. A great device for mitigating these factors is a ceramic canister that holds 1/2 lb. to 1lb. of coffee. The canister should have some sort of sealing mechanism that does not allow air to circulate. There is a fundamental rule of physics that states that matter can not occupy the same space as other matter. So keeping your coffee filled to the rim of this container will minimize the possibility of negative elements corrupting your coffee. Additionally, a ceramic canister will protect the coffee from sunlight, water, and flavor migration. Flavor migration happens when the container harbors flavors. Plastic containers are great examples of this concept. Plastics allow flavor molecules to penetrate and metallic canisters allow metallic flavors to migrate. Ceramic containers, on the other hand, are sealed and baked. Consequently, they will not corrupt the flavor of the coffee. ### Bottom Line Short-term storage (within one to two weeks of purchase) should be done in a ceramic container with a good sealing mechanism. Fill the canister to capacity. ### Conclusion If you find yourself at a coffee shop that has a sale on Jamaican Blue Mountain and if you buy more than you can brew in a week or two, store the coffee properly. - Determine which portion of that coffee you will consume within one week. - Put the amount you can consume that week into a ceramic canister. - Divide the rest of the coffee into ‘one-week packages’ and store them in the freezer, as I’ve described in this article. - When you need more coffee, pull another ‘one-week package’ out of the freezer and transfer the coffee into short-term storage. ### Resources [How to Store Coffee Beans (Tips and Recommendations)](https://ineedcoffee.com/how-to-store-coffee-beans-tips-and-recommendations/) – Our updated article on storing coffee beans.

# Coffee Wake-Up! [Cafe Culture](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/cafe-culture/)---by [Ian Balchin](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/ian-balchin/) I always liked a coffee – morning, noon, and night. A cup of tea was fine but not at night (it keeps me awake)! Whether an instant coffee or one brewed at a local cafe, it would do. Of course, there are good coffees and bad coffees, but I was not prepared for what I found on a recent visit to Australia. Note that I live in a small town in South Africa, proverbially 500 miles up a 1000-mile dirt road, so a good coffee experience is limited here. On our first day, we stopped for a morning coffee in the Ferry Road Market in Southport. Amazing! A beautiful heart in coffee brown and milk white on the top? I was so surprised that I took a picture of this creation. And the coffee was great. Great like I had never had such a cup before, great like what have I been missing all my life? From one end of Queensland to the other we had coffee, coffee, and more coffee. With the odd exception, it was great stuff. From ‘Aroma’ in Noosa to Xcoffee in Labrador we found such delights of taste and aroma, such tantalising and dedicated coffee outlets. Such artistic patterns on the top of the coffee too!![Latte Etching by Ian Balchin](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/latte-art-flower-ian1.DGFsz3qr_1ritu.webp)_Latte Etching by Ian Balchin_ Back home, I wanted to know how I could recreate that delicious coffee I had had on holiday. Now I had to dump the electric drip machine, the glossy plastic finish in the filter section was eaten away and I assumed that the porous plastic surface there harboured staleness itself. Whatever I made with it was a waste of coffee and effort. It was better to use a high-grade instant coffee I thought. Now in a small town where there are no green beans, no coffee roasters, no roast beans even. As the supermarket manager explained, “nobody wants beans, so we just keep the ground coffee”. So I was stuck with the standard packet of coffee in 3 assorted flavours. I had purchased at a local fete, some years ago, a small standalone espresso machine which I had had little luck with. The instructions needed instructions on how to decipher them. At another fete, shortly after my return, I found a rotating-blade coffee bean grinder. So I set about trying to recreate what I had left behind in the Antipodes and pressed the little device into action. I found that a good whizz of the standard ground coffee in the grinder reduced the particle size dramatically and swiftly to face powder consistency. Unfortunately, the water would not go through, and the safety mechanism rotated the basket off with a huge whoosh of steam, leaving grounds all over the kitchen. So I discovered the need to not over grind and not tamp down with all my might (the bottom of a small round olive oil bottle fitted the basket just right and with a little effort I could compress the coffee completely solid).![Latte Art by Ian Balchin](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/latte-etching-sweetner.BNA57LrN_1Eddjd.webp)_Latte Art by Ian Balchin_ Once I could get the coffee through without disaster I concentrated on 2-cup brews only. I need a proper ‘tamper’, I need a source of beans which I am told is available 80 miles down the road at our local ‘city’. I would love to find a popcorn popper at the next fete but I had to persevere with what I had to hand. I reduced the fineness of the grind, about 6 seconds is good. I only tamp down enough so that it looks solid but isn’t really. I get water from a nearby spring since the local tap water is very suspect. I have found the best of the available roasts. So how is it now? Well, I haven’t got it to the standard experienced in Australia, far from it, but it is better than it used to be, it is even better than the local coffee shop if only I say so. So until I can move on it is just fine for now. Getting roast beans is my next move. But just how do I get that picture on the top? Published on December 16, 2009--- #### Ian Balchin I have owned and ran Fables Bookshop in Grahamstown, South Africa, for 20 years now. I do try to ensure that we have reasonable coffee for the staff and not just the lowest grade of instant on the supermarket shelf, sometimes my efforts are even appreciated! I enjoy some computer programming in Perl which frequently causes excessive coffee consumption to concentrate my efforts. I look forward to improving my home brew by roasting my own beans some time.

# Cold Brew Coffee is Not Rocket Science [Brewing Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/brewing-coffee/)---by [Michael Allen Smith](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/michael-allen-smith/)![Cold Brew Coffee is Not Rocket Science](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/cold-brew-coffee-is-not-rocket-science/cold-brew-coffee-is-not-rocket-science.jpg) It is that time of year again when coffee shops start selling overpriced cold-brewed coffee. Paying $4 or $5 for a cup of cold-brewed coffee is ridiculous once you know how easy it is to make your own. Cold-brewing a coffee concentrate is not rocket science. 1. Place ground coffee in contact with cold water for several hours. 2. Filter out the coffee. 3. Done. 4. At this point, you can add more water, milk, or even Baileys Irish Cream. The only question is how do you want to filter the coffee? You could use the classic [Toddy](https://ineedcoffee.com/cold-brew-coffee-with-the-toddy-coffee-maker/), the [Primula](https://ineedcoffee.com/making-cold-brew-coffee-with-the-primula-coffee-maker/), or you could [build your own](https://ineedcoffee.com/cold-brewed-coffee-on-the-cheap/) on the cheap. In this tutorial, we are going to use the Reusable Cold Brew Coffee Filter Pouch by Madesco and a glass jar. No plugs or drilling or special filters. This is about as easy as coffee brewing can get. For this tutorial, we are using Madesco’s Reusable Cold Brew Coffee Pouch in its basic size, which is perfect for a quart-sized container. If you need to make much larger quantities, Madesco also has a 5-gallon option. ### What Coffee To Use? You do not need a special coffee to make cold-brewed coffee. Use the coffees you normally like. Some roasters are making special blends for cold brew and iced coffee. Typically, they tend to be lightly roasted. They are also often a blend of African coffees with fruity notes and Central American coffees with chocolate notes. But again, any coffee that you already like will work.![cold brew coffee pouch](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/pouch2-650x466.-CsxDZ-I_Z173fED.webp)_Reusable Cold Brew Coffee Filter Pouches_![1 quart glass jar](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/empty-jar-650x538.BsKMEfBm_mKv4w.webp)_1-quart glass jar. You can go larger, add more coffee._ ![cup-coffee-beans](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/cup-coffee-beans-650x404.CGjq4n-D_uO94N.webp)_1 cup of coffee beans. Be sure to grind them before adding them to the pouch._### #1 Grind Coffee and Add to Pouch Add one cup of ground coffee to the cold brew pouch. Some brewing recipes say to use coarse ground coffee, and others say to use medium ground coffee. Both work. Madesco advises a medium grind in the instructions, so I used a medium grind. Cold brew is super forgiving.![add ground coffee to pouch](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/add-coffee-to-pouch-650x408.CKCgt-GJ_Q7B5a.webp)_Add ground coffee to the cold brew pouch._### #2 Place Pouch Inside Jar and Add Water Place the cold brew pouch’s bottom into the glass jar’s bottom. Don’t close the pouch drawstring yet. Slowly add cold water, enough to fill the jar. Don’t pour the water in quickly, or the coffee might float up and out of the pouch.![Add water to coffee grounds](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/add-water-to-grounds-650x541.oyFVzSzc_18dkFU.webp) ### #3 Close the Pouch and Seal the Lid Pull the drawstring. Push the pouch down into the jar and then close the jar. I kept the drawstring outside the jar to keep it dry, but you don’t have to.![Close lid jar](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/close-lid-jar-650x493.D5SibLSh_Z2ax2Jr.webp) *The lid is closed and the drawstring is outside the jar. If you keep the drawstring outside the jar, put a plate or saucer under the jar because little drops of coffee will escape down the string onto whatever you place your jar on. *### #4 Let Coffee Steep for 12 or More Hours You can “cold brew” in the refrigerator or set it on the counter overnight. I use the counter. How long you steep the coffee is up to you. Most cold brew recipes use a 12-24 hour range. The longer you steep, the more concentrated the brew will become. So it all comes down to personal preference. My brews with the coffee pouch all fell into the 12-16 hour range. ### #5 Remove Pouch and Place Coffee Concentrate into Refrigerator Take the pouch out slowly, letting all the coffee drain into the jar. Seal the jar and place it in the refrigerator. The concentrate is finished.![finished-cold-brew](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/finished-cold-brew-650x462.CkcHLF-3_Z1rVYHI.webp) ### #6 Quick Clean Up Empty the grounds inside the pouch into a compost container or your garden. Turn the filter inside out and rinse the pouch. Then hang it up somewhere to dry, ready for the next brew. ### #7 Serve the Coffee Concentrate This is where the cold brew gets fun. You can decide how strong you like it based on your tastes. I experimented with adding 2/3 of a mug filled with concentrate and 1/3 water. You can drink it cold or heat it up on a stove or microwave. You can also use cold brew concentrate for blended iced coffee drinks and [coffee martinis](https://ineedcoffee.com/the-coffee-martini/).![iced cold brew coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/iced-cold-brew-coffee-650x428.VXZ7hqnT_Z4QkzK.webp) ### A Word on Ratios The standard advice for those that weigh when they make a cold brew concentrate is to use a 4 to 1 brewing ratio. That is 4 parts water to 1 part coffee. This is significantly stronger than hot brewed coffee which is often in the 15-17 to 1 range. Because cold brew is a concentrate, you’ll need to add water and/or ice to dilute the coffee when you serve it. If you don’t add the water, you’ll not only get a strong coffee but also a tremendous amount of caffeine. ### Initial Guidance If you don’t have much experience with cold brew, you may want to purchase a quality cold brew and have it on hand when you make your own. Comparing side-by-side will help you calibrate your tastes when you dial in your own recipe. ### Last Words Cold-brew is this simple. Cold brew coffee is not rocket science. ### Resources [Coffee Brewing Guide](https://ineedcoffee.com/coffee-brewing-guide/)  – INeedCoffee has several cold brew coffee tutorials._Disclosure: INeedCoffee received a Cold Brew Coffee Filter Pouch from Madesco to complete this tutorial._ _Title photo by [Matt Hoffman](https://unsplash.com/@__matthoffman__)_ Published on August 31, 2019--- #### Michael Allen Smith Michael Allen Smith is both a coffee fanatic and a web developer.

# Make Cold Brew Coffee with the Toddy Coffee Maker [Brewing Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/brewing-coffee/)---by [Michael Allen Smith](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/michael-allen-smith/)![Make Cold Brew Coffee with the Toddy Coffee Maker](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/cold-brew-coffee-with-the-toddy-coffee-maker/cold-brew-coffee-toddy-maker.jpg) Many years ago, I attempted my first cold brew coffee when I knew far less about coffee than I do today. It was a disaster. The coffee was so vile that I threw it out after a single sip. I assumed it was an inferior brewing method at the time and never gave it another chance. Recently, I met some fellow home coffee roasters whose opinions I respected. They told me of their love for the cold brew method. It was time to give the Toddy another chance. The first thing you learn is that you aren’t brewing coffee. You are brewing a coffee concentrate. The coffee concentrate brews at room temperature and stores cold. According to Toddy, a cold-brewed concentrate will remain in the refrigerator for 14 days. To make a cup of cold brew, pour one part of concentrate into a mug with three parts of water. Then microwave. In the age of dedicated machines whose sole function is to brew a single cup of coffee with little or no cleanup, the cold-brewed method may be the simplest. ### Must it be the Toddy? Toddy started cold brewing in 1964. Before that, it was done for who knows how many years in Central America. You don’t need a Toddy to make cold-brewed coffee. There are other methods. See our [Coffee Brewing Guide](https://ineedcoffee.com/coffee-brewing-guide/) for more cold brewing ideas. The Toddy Brewer’s design makes it easy enough to get started. It’s an inexpensive brewing system that costs around $30. ### Reasons To Cold Brew Is this the right brewing system for you? Below is a short list of the situations that would be best suited for cold-brewed coffee. - Coffee drinkers that find coffee too acidic. Toddy says their cold brew system produces “67% less acid than coffee made by conventional hot brew methods.” This is a big plus for coffee drinkers with acid reflux. - Less Caffeine? An MSNBC article stated Toddy claims their coffee has “up to two-thirds less caffeine than regular coffee.” I’m a bit skeptical of this claim. UPDATE: Toddy has informed me that MSNBC made a mistake in its reporting. From Toddy: “Our claim is cold-brewed coffee has approximately 33 percent less caffeine than coffee brewed (using regular caffeinated beans) by conventional hot water methods.” - There are households where everyone drinks coffee at different times. It’s hard to know when to make a full pot if everyone drinks coffee at different times. Moving to a single-cup solution solves that problem. - Camping. Use a campfire to heat your water to add to the concentrate. - Iced coffee drinkers. Add ice and water, and you’re done—no more need to chill hot brewed coffee. - Power Outage. The grinding may require electricity, but not the brewing method. - Coffee that is getting old. I’ve learned it is common practice for coffee shops to use their oldest beans for cold-brewed coffee. When it comes to flavor, slow-brewed concentrates don’t require as fresh coffee as other brewing methods. ### Reasons to NOT Cold Brew - French Press and espresso fans. Fans of the coffee oils may find the flavor weaker and less interesting. - Small-batch Home Roasters. The Toddy works best with a full pound of coffee, which can be a lot of roasting (and grinding) to do at one time for home roasters. ### Equipment Checklist - Brewing Container – This is the big white plastic thing. - Reusable Filter – A white circular sponge that fits inside the brewing container. - Stopper – A little rubber wedge that fits snugly outside the Brewing Container. - Glass Decanter – What we will use to store the coffee. - Decanter Top – The lid to seal the Glass Decanter. - Ring with Handle – An Optional piece can be used as a handle. - 1 pound of Coffee Ground Regular (aka Drip or Vac-Pot). ### #1 Secure Stopper into Brewing Container Turn the brewing container upside down and from the outside, and wedge the stopper into the open hole. The fit needs to be tight, but do not forcefully wedge the stopper too far. It will hold the coffee for 12 hours and will need to be removed at that time.![Upside down Toddy Coffee maker](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/start_upside-down400.BhVonZcY_1sKaxw.webp)![Toddy coffee maker with plug](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/plugged-upside-down400.Ca9rbqPR_1TpkYU.webp) ### #2 Wet and Insert Filter Take the Reusable Filter and wet it. Then place it snugly into the inside bottom of the Brewing Container.![Toddy Filter - coffee maker](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/filter400.Cd1eRX-u_1NPcEV.webp)![Wet Toddy Filter](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/filter-wet400.D5VYqncb_23o2qP.webp)![Insert Toddy filter inside coffee maker](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/filter-insert400.BdyC2PUL_Z1BuxLo.webp) ### #3 Add 1 pound of coffee into the Brewing Container Cold-brewed coffee requires an extra coarse grind. See the [Coffee Grind Chart](https://ineedcoffee.com/coffee-grind-chart/) for a visual explanation.![add Coffee in Toddy maker](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/pour-coffee400.cfCudakD_1ThO1n.webp) ### #4 Slowly and evenly add 4 cups of water, then wait 5 minutes Do not stir the coffee mixture. ### #5 After the 5 minutes, add 5 more cups of cold water slowly and evenly. This should take the mixture to the top of the Brewing Container. **Again, do not stir.**![Toddy coffee maker with water](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/after-water400.p7KPxv7K_1oAApF.webp) ### #6 (optional) Cover top with plastic wrap Keep dust or insects from landing on the coffee while it brews for 12 hours. ### #7 Allow 10-12 hours for coffee to steep The coffee steeps at room temperature. The “Cold” portion comes when the final product is stored. ### #8 Release coffee into Glass Decanter Use the Ring with Handle to assist you when you lift the Brewing Container over the Glass Decanter. When the coffee is above the Glass Decanter, reach under the Brewing Container with your free hand and remove the Stopper. A slight turn of the Stopper should free it, and coffee will trickle out of the Brewing Container and into the Glass Decanter.![Toddy coffee Finished Brewing](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/release400.D_us-xQT_RNynK.webp) ### #9 Allow 20-30 minutes for the coffee to flow into the Glass Decanter. When complete, remove the Brewing Container. Then seal the Glass Decanter with the Decanter top and store it in the refrigerator. ### #10 Clean the Brewing Container and put it away for future use. According to Toddy, the filter will be stored in a _Ziploc-type bag_ inside the refrigerator. Why a filter needs to be cold-stored is not clear. A filter can be used for 10 brews. ### Preparing a Hot Cup of Coffee Now comes the quick and easy part. Heat three parts water. After heating the water, add one part of the coffee concentrate. Adding the coffee before heating the water will result in a hotter coffee, but it may come at the expense of flavor. So, heat the water first, and then add the coffee. ### Making Cold Coffee Add one part concentrate to two parts water over ice. You could even get fancy by making coffee concentrate ice cubes. ### Troubleshooting #### Coffee Brews Too Fast or Too Slow The coffee should take 20-30 minutes to fall into the Glass Decanter. The best way to ensure this is to have a consistent grind. Even though I have a decent bean grinder at home, I will have my local coffee roaster grind for me before making cold-brewed coffee. When grinding a full pound at once, it’s best to do it with a commercial-grade machine. #### Coffee Tastes Weak It shouldn’t, as this is a concentrate. #### Coffee Taste Too Strong Add more water to the concentrate. #### Hot Coffee Isn’t Hot Enough If you use a kettle to heat water and then pour that hot water into the cold coffee concentrate, the temperature will NOT be as hot as it would be with other brewing methods. When I use a kettle for the water, I still warm the concentrate in the microwave. #### Coffee Tastes Bitter Bitterness is usually caused by one of two things: either the grind is too fine or the beans are stale. If the beans taste fine using another brewing method, then the problem is the grind. #### Coffee Tastes Thin If you are used to drinking coffee where the filter allows the oils to be added to the brewing process, such as espresso, press pot, or gold-filter drip, then getting used to cold brew could take a while. ### Last Words I now know it’s possible to make an excellent cup of coffee using this brewing method. ### Resources [Make Concentrated Cold Brew Coffee With the Penguin Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/make-concentrated-cold-brew-coffee-with-the-penguin-coffee/) – A better way to make cold brew coffee.

# Cold Brew Coffee Cupcakes With Mocha Buttercream Frosting Recipe [Recipes](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/coffee-recipes/)---by [Mark Morphew](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/mark-morphew/)![Cold Brew Coffee Cupcakes With Mocha Buttercream Frosting Recipe](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/cold-brew-coffee-cupcakes-with-mocha-buttercream-frosting-recipe/Cold-Brew-Coffee-Cupcakes-Recipe.jpg) I’ll admit that I have two vices in this world, and both aren’t particularly healthy in large quantities. My name is Mark, and I’m addicted to coffee and cupcakes! I am a HUGE coffee addict, ask anyone and they will tell you that they never see me without a cup of coffee in my hand, damn if I could I would be hooked up 24/7 to a coffee IV drip! So when my wife decided to bake a batch of coffee cupcakes with mocha butterscotch frosting I literally started doing cartwheels; the best of both worlds I thought, and I wasn’t disappointed. For any coffee lover, today is your lucky day, because my wife has been kind enough to share her coffee cupcake recipe with all of you. So wipe that drool from the side of your mouth because this cold brew coffee mocha cupcake recipe is going to get your heart racing. This coffee cupcake recipe is slightly different from others you’ll find scattered all over the web, and the main difference is the use of cold drip coffee in the ingredients. In our house, we often have an Iwaki Cold Drip Brewer in the fridge, so we always have access to fresh cold coffee. But for those of you who don’t have a cold drip or cold brew coffee maker, any leftover coffee from your French Press or even an automatic coffee maker can be used as a substitute. So if you’re ready to get your hands on this awesome mocha coffee cupcake recipe, the wait is over, grab yourself a pen, paper, and a large coffee (to drink not for the recipe) and let’s crack on!![cold brew cupcakes with mocha frosting](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/mocha-cupcakes-0793.Ci3J8KKp_1lONGP.webp) ### How To Make Coffee Cupcakes With Mocha Buttercream Frosting This cupcake recipe is super easy and has everything in it that gives that ‘good’ feeling, in under one hour you’ll have some delicious coffee-infused cupcakes to share with your family and friends. #### Cooking and Preparation Time: Prep: 25 min.

# The Osaka Cold Brew Dripper Tutorial [Brewing Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/brewing-coffee/)---by [Michael Allen Smith](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/michael-allen-smith/)![The Osaka Cold Brew Dripper Tutorial](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/cold-brew-dripper-tutorial/cold-brew-dripper.jpg) Some fancy coffee shops have these large, beautiful brewers that make coffee one drop at a time. A top chamber holds very cold water, sometimes mixed with ice. That water is set to slowly release onto coffee grounds drop by drop, maybe one drop every 1-3 seconds. The coffee passes through the grounds into a container holding the finished brew below. Brewing takes a long time, but the taste is bright and wonderful. It highlights attributes of coffee that are more difficult to taste when served hot. The good news is that you do not need to seek a fancy Japanese Oji Water Dripper to try this brewing method. You can brew cold drip coffee at home. ### Not Cold Brew or Iced Coffee Cold Drip coffee is different from cold brew or even iced coffee. It is its own style. Cold Brew coffee is a full immersion brewing method. This means the coffee makes contact with the water the entire brewing cycle. It is more like a very long French Press. To learn more about Cold Brew coffee, see the article [Cold Brew Coffee is Not Rocket Science](https://ineedcoffee.com/cold-brew-coffee-is-not-rocket-science/). Contrast this with drip immersion, where the water makes contact with the coffee and passes through. Iced coffee can be either full or drip immersion, but in most cases, the brewing time equals that of its hot brew equivalent. The coffee is brewed hot using a smaller amount of water and is then released onto the ice. If you get the ratios right what you get is a rich cup of coffee that is not watered down and cool to cold in temperature. For an example of this brewing method see the article [A Clever Way to Make Iced Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/clever-way-make-iced-coffee/). #### Cold Brew Coffee - 12 – 36 hours - Brews using room temperature water - Full immersion #### Iced Coffee - 2-4 minutes (same as hot coffee) - Hot water passes through the coffee onto the ice. - Full or Drip #### Cold Dripper - 2-4 hours*- Cold (some ice is optional) - Drip_* Some large commercial drippers will take 12-24 hours to brew._### Flavor To me, the flavor of Cold Drip Coffee is much closer to Iced Coffee than Cold Brew. The cold dripper highlights delicate flavors that are sometimes harder to detect or lost in hot brewed coffee. Whenever I begin experimenting with a new coffee brewer, I grab the oldest coffee I have for the first few batches. I expect a learning curve and that the first few brews won’t be the best. Why not put my old coffee to good use? For my initial brews, I used a somewhat flat older Tanzania that I thought was a little over-roasted when I made it in an [AeroPress](https://ineedcoffee.com/upside-aeropress-coffee-brewing-tutorial/). When I made it with the Cold Brew Dripper, I was shocked. It was bright and lively. A coffee I planned on throwing away tasted amazing with the cold dripper. The cold dripper will not make all flat coffee taste great, but this brewing method will benefit those coffees on the edge. ### Tutorial Setup We will use the Cold Brew Dripper by Osaka Coffee for this cold dripper tutorial. It consists of three parts. The top part is the chamber holding the cold water and ice. It also includes a lid. The middle part is the filter, which holds the ground coffee. It will rest on the third part, which is the glass carafe.![osaka coffee dripper setup](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/osaka-coffee-dripper-1-650x433.BWBwYYSV_ZR4ryR.webp) ### #1 Dosing the Coffee As with all brewing methods, we start by finding our ratio. This means parts water to parts coffee. I often use a 17-1 ratio (water to coffee) for hot coffee and a 4-1 ratio for a cold brew. Osaka recommends a 14-1 ratio. I liked that ratio for African coffees but found it a little weak for Latin American coffee. I got better results when I strengthened the ratio to 12-1. I was using lighter roasted coffees. The ideal ratio ranges from 10-1 to 15-1. Experiment. This tutorial will use 35 grams of coffee brewed at a 12-1 ratio.![osaka coffee dripper brewer](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/osaka-side-brewer-650x433.CL3fDqi2_1oa2WL.webp) ### #2 Grind Coffee The coffee will be ground medium coarse. See our [Coffee Grind Chart](https://ineedcoffee.com/coffee-grind-chart/) for a visual explanation. Place the ground coffee inside the filter. ### #3 Measure out Water and Ice The top chamber will hold a mixture of ice and water. Two things can go wrong here. If you use too much ice, the brew can’t finish until the ice is melted. You don’t want to be staring at a chamber of ice for an hour or more, waiting for it to melt. On the other hand, if you don’t use enough ice and the finished product isn’t cold, you can always add ice later. It’s not ideal either, but it’s not a problem. The perfect outcome is that all the ice melts and the finished coffee is cold. What is a good ratio? It depends on whether the water you use is already cold and how warm the room where you are brewing is. For a cool office with chilled water, you won’t need any ice at all. For a warm kitchen using room-temperature water, start with 40% of the water weight as ice. Using cold water at a normal kitchen temperature of 68-72°F, I got the best results using 10% ice. - 35 grams of ground coffee - 35 * 12 = 420 grams total water - 420 * 10% = 42 grams ice - 420 – 42 = 378 grams cold water Weigh 42 grams of ice and place it in the top chamber. Also, weigh 378 grams of cold water into something you can use to pour. #### No scale? You can still make the coffee if you do not have a scale. Fill the filter with ground coffee until almost the top. Then in the top chamber fill it to the line with cold water and ice. Unless the brewing environment is warm, use very little ice. Just a few cubes. If you use this as a starting point, you can adjust in subsequent brews to make the coffee stronger or weaker to your liking.![add ice to cold coffee dripper](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/ice-in-cold-dripper-433x650.DkJ3aHiA_Z2eVCzr.webp) ### #4 Wet the Ground Coffee You will not start brewing directly on the dry ground coffee. Before placing the top chamber above the filter, gently pour just enough water over the coffee to wet the beans. You will be pouring cold water from the container. By wetting the beans, you ensure that all the grounds contact water. If you don’t wet the beans, the water drops can tunnel straight down, leaving the coffee around the top edges dry. This means your coffee could taste weak.![wet coffee grounds - dripper](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/wet-grounds-2-433x650.C8Lw8jDZ_Z1A8zi3.webp) ### #5 Commence Dripping Now that the coffee grounds have been soaked, place the top chamber on the brewer. Add the remaining cold water to the ice, and place the lid on top of this chamber. At this point, you will dial in the dripper. By turning the handle, you can control the flow of coffee into the bottom chamber. Osaka recommends aiming for two drops every 3 seconds.![cold coffee drip begins](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/cold-drip-begins-above-650x433.B1KnBu24_Z1MWaVz.webp) ### #6 Adjust Dripper After 60-90 Minutes As the water weight in the top chamber drops, so will the flow rate. After about 60-90 minutes, adjust the flow to bring the dripper back to two drops every 3 seconds.![adjust coffee dripper ](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/adjust-dripper-1-433x650.D2OzghB0_Z1Dj244.webp) ### #7 Serve and Enjoy The brew is complete when the last drop of water has left the top chamber and passed through the coffee. Remove the top and middle chambers. Pour and enjoy. If it is not cold enough, add ice or place it in the refrigerator. If it is too strong, you can add more cold water. And if it is too weak, you can try again with more coffee, less water, or a little finer grind.![remove cold dripper filter ](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/remove-cold-dripper-filter-1-650x433.cmnEiAMX_1AL6SW.webp)![pour iced coffee from coffee dripper ](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/pour-cold-drip-1-433x650.DZtk_YV2_cunS.webp) ### #8 Clean Up The clean-up is super simple. Empty the grounds into a compost bin or garden. Rinse all the parts and set them aside to dry. The Osaka Cold Brew Dripper is dishwasher safe, but other drippers may or may not be. Check first. ### Troubleshooting If your coffee tastes weak and you can see the drips have made a tunnel directly into the center of the beans, there is a fix. Place the second filter on top of the ground coffee just after you wet the grounds in Step #4. This will diffuse the water evenly across the beans. I did not need to do this trick for most of my brews, but when the coffee I used was older or darker, having the second filter on top evened out the water flow through the ground coffee. No more tunnel.![second filter cold dripper](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/second-filter-cold-dripper-650x456.CLVqJZUS_2lvDQY.webp) ### Not for Everyone The Cold Dripper is not the ideal coffee brewer for everyone. It has a very long brew cycle. However, I think it would be perfect for someone with a desk job. Come into work with a hot coffee and then set up the dripper. A few hours later, you have your next delicious coffee waiting for you. No electricity is required. In my article [The Quest for Good Coffee in the Office](https://ineedcoffee.com/the-quest-for-good-coffee-in-the-office/), I told the tale of how my office had a strict policy against bringing in any electrical appliances, so I had to break the rules. What I didn’t cover in the article was my rebel coffee lab was eventually shut down. With the Cold Dripper, I could have had great coffee without breaking any rules. ### Resources [Coffee Brewing Guide](https://ineedcoffee.com/coffee-brewing-guide/) – INeedCoffee brewing guide resource._[Title photo](https://flic.kr/p/Wekkgw) by arbyreed.__Disclosure: Osaka donated a Coffee Dripper brewer for this tutorial._ *Brewing photos by Joseph Robertson of Extracted Magazine, a digital coffee magazine published for iOS and Android. * Published on May 9, 2019--- #### Michael Allen Smith Michael Allen Smith is both a coffee fanatic and a web developer.

# Home Roasting Coffee with a Heat Gun and Bread Machine [Roasting Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/roasting-coffee/)---by [Sam Hampton](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/sam-hampton/)![Home Roasting Coffee with a Heat Gun and Bread Machine](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/corretto-home-roasting/corretto-home-roasting.jpg) The various devices used to roast coffee beans provide heat to roast the beans in different ways. The three methods are convection, conduction, and radiation. Listed in the chart below are some of the differences in the effect of these devices. There are at least three ways to determine the differences in the heat transfer process in coffee roasting. WAG, EG, and SP. WAG, aka wild-ass guess, is perhaps the least reliable but gives one at least a starting point to understand the heat transfer process. EG, aka educated guessium, is an assessment of a WAG after having thought at length about it and researching the internet extensively until one’s eyes will not focus any longer to find an answer. SP, aka scientific process, is the most reliable, but it is a little too time-consuming and costly in order to collect enough data to be accepted as a valid presumption. The chart below is EG certified.![home coffee roaster comparision](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/roaster-comparision.BuhgvS3E_1Xcfr9.webp) ### A Brief History of Time and Coffee And thanks to a real “SP” kind of guy, Stephen Hawking, for giving us an insight into time and coffee. Coffee beans in the green, stable state contain about 10% to 12.5% water, internally and externally. When roasting, the process to rid the beans of this moisture should occur in about three or four minutes and be completed before reaching a BT (bean temperature) of 212° F or 100° C. The Maillard reaction starts when the beans start to turn white and then yellow nearing 130° C. The Maillard reaction is the process when the beans start changing from yellow to tan to light brown. This period changes the sugars and other compounds into a state that will allow the beans to become roasted enough to be an almost palatable beverage. The Maillard reaction usually takes about three to four minutes and is usually complete when the BT reaches 170° C. The final elimination of water and maturing of the roast occurs after the Maillard reaction is known as the Development Stage. This is when the beans roast enough to become a drinkable coffee and are at the commonly known point of the 1st crack stage of roasting; the 1st crack lasts from one to three minutes. The first crack is the final definition of the roasting process and most roasters agree that coffee beans should not be roasted into the 2nd crack for more than a minute.![Corretto Home Coffee Roasting](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/coffee-rasting-bread-machine.48nC2Tox_Z1ieJAH.webp)_The Corretto roaster in action, with average roast times of 10 to 12 minutes._### The Crocodile Dundee Connection My first roast was with a [heat gun](https://ineedcoffee.com/roasting-coffee-with-a-heat-gun-a-top-down-approach/) and a dog bowl. I quickly graduated to the [popcorn popper](https://ineedcoffee.com/roasting-coffee-in-a-popcorn-popper/) and amassed a [menagerie of poppers and modified poppers](https://ineedcoffee.com/coffee-roasting-popcorn-poppers/) that lasted a couple of years. I was roasting up to ten batches of four ounces each (40 ounces) per session about every two or three weeks. I roasted so many times I finally started to understand the roasting process. After two years, roasting so many batches in about two or three hours of sessions gave me an insight into the nuances of roasting but exhausted my desire to roast. I had to have a shorter process of roasting more beans at a time and in less time. I looked around and settled on the “Corretto” style of roasting, which was promoted and invented by a group of Coffee Snobs in Australia. The process used a bread machine and a heat gun, which I already had and cost $10.00. I found a bread machine at the Salvation Army resale store. I waited for the Friday discount and picked it up for $3.50. After a few sample roasts, which were only six inches above the dog bowl roasting process, I modified the bread machine with switches ($10.00) that made the paddle work all the time and rewired the heating element (that I never use) to work at the flip of a finger.![Bread Machine Home Roasting](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/chris-bounds-bread-machine.Cef7kOzW_Z20sM0f.webp)_Chris Bound of Texas has an elegant setup to roast his beans._### Corretto Roasting Overview Now Corretto roasting does not require anything but a bread machine and a heat gun (and the nerve to roast a pound of green beans). The bread machine does not need to be modified, as I described above, to roast green coffee beans as long as it has a “dough” cycle that does not turn on the heating element. The dough cycle can be activated and will agitate the beans so they have enough motion to roast evenly and not scorch or burn them. The heat gun can be turned on high, and the temperature can be regulated by moving the nozzle closer to or farther away from the beans as they roast. Placing the nozzle about six inches from the swirling beans is a good place to start. The roasting process will produce a lot of chaff and smoke, so it is recommended as an outdoor project. Over the past two years, I refined my Corretto roasting by writing an Excel spreadsheet template to log my roasting data and give me information on the ROR (rate of rise), and also a neat graphic chart of the various roasting stages. I added a K type thermometer to give a real accurate bean temperature. l kept the lid on because it helped control the chafe.![temp control](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/temp-control.DspO9DDK_2cjHdQ.webp)_A K type temperature probe records a very accurate bean temperature, and the router control allows an adjustment of the airflow and heat from the heat gun._### With Corretto Roasting, I am Getting Great Results I have read many articles that downgrade any coffee roaster that is not a big, round drum as being valid. I dare say that I can roast with the precision of any large drum roaster and get just as good a roast, if not better. Knowledge is in the expertise of understanding what you are doing, not in how you are doing it. Ansel Adams used a simple Brownie box camera to make some of his greatest photographs. I have often wondered why more roasters are not using the Corretto style of roasting. I finally figured it out. No one is making money off this style of roasting, and many think that nothing good or innovative could possibly come from the land down under. But note with the exception that Mick Dundee, along with an unforgettable rear-end view of Linda Kozlowski, as she is almost eaten by a real crock, are from down under. Even I used to refer to this style of roasting as BMHG (Bread Maker Heat Gun), but you have to give the Corretto guys their due. It is a great style of roasting and gets the job done of turning green beans into great coffee.![Home roasted coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/cooling-roasted-coffee-beans.Qq0NfAMN_ZEwLa9.webp)_A completed roast of Kenya AA._ Best of Luck and Good Roasting ….SH ### Resources [A Fireside Chat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofFAdnhEu7c) – Trout Doc YouTube channel that includes photos of both Corretto and popper roasting.

He constantly strived, regardless of where he was, to have the best coffee available under the circumstances. He just never roasted his own. Roasting his own seemed to evade him over the years, until a video by the Yankee Self-Sufficiency (Combining Snarky and Fine Coffee) encouraged him to try his hand at it.

# Cold Brewed Coffee on the Cheap [Brewing Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/brewing-coffee/)---by [Malcom McFarren](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/malcom-mcfarren/)![Cold Brewed Coffee on the Cheap](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/cold-brewed-coffee-on-the-cheap/Fig_05.jpg) If you are a regular visitor to this site, you are probably already aware of the cold-brewed coffee drink. At least two other articles go into the advantages/disadvantages of the cold brewing method compared to the many hot-brewing methods available. Because it’s already been done, I won’t go into it here. This is simply a how-to for people who would like to try cold-brewed coffee before shelling out the money for a commercially available system – or for those who, like myself, are just too cheap to break down and spend $30 when they don’t have to. ### What you will need Below, you will see the things you will need to make your own cold brewing system. They are as follows:![Cold brewed Coffee Supplies](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/Fig_011.D8pLmwA8_1okrf.webp)_Cold-brewed Coffee Supplies_1. 32 oz plastic beverage cups ( 2 of the same kind that nests inside one another) 2. Something to make the holes with. (I have a 1/16 drill bit, glued into a wire nut) See fig 2. 3. Pencil 4. Scissors. (Any other instrument suitable for cutting cardboard will work.) 5. a piece of cardboard cut to a square of about 6×6. 6. A plastic bottle suitable for storing beverages you plan to drink.![Figure 2 - the drill](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/Fig_02.Bz1SGH3x_1YN7yl.webp)_Figure 2 – the drill_### Getting Started Take one of the cups, turn it bottom side up, and start making holes. Lots of holes, don’t be shy the more you drill, the faster it will drain when it’s done brewing. Spacing is not really an issue, either. I should point out that although I am using a finger drill here, that doesn’t mean that that is what it takes. I use one because I already have one. If I didn’t, I would probably use a pushpin or T-pin, or something else on that order.![Using the drill on the cup.](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/Fig_03.Cod7wWrE_o7y8a.webp)_Using the drill on the cup._ The cup after you’re done drilling.![Drilled holes in the cup.](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/Fig_04.UoPmjAIm_Z1IBwAu.webp)_Drilled holes in the cup._ Make sure that you don’t have any little pieces of plastic in the cup, and you are ready to do the next part, the spacer. To make the spacer, just take the piece of cardboard, set a cup on it, and trace around it with the pencil. Don’t get this too tight. You want the cup to fit down into it a little way.![Tracing the Cardboard](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/Fig_05.mD3sxwoF_Z1zJ0jS.webp)_Tracing the Cardboard_ Once you have the circle traced, cut out the circle, throw it away, and keep the rest. So you know what we’re going for here, this is how they will be used.![Cup inside the cut out cardboard](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/Fig_06.CeBkbSmd_ZidslP.webp)_Cup inside the cutout_ _cardboard_### Making Coffee The hard part is over, we’re ready to start brewing. What you need now, is your two cups, the one with the holes in the bottom, inside the other one.![brew cup](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/Fig_07.DrLZdPIt_Z2fbVnm.webp) Next, you will need three pre-measured bags of auto-drip coffee… or at least that is how I do it. That comes to about 4-4.5 oz. or approximately 11/2 Cups of ground coffee. Pour in about a half cup of water:![pour in half cup of water](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/Fig_09.BeZMZZ2b_Z1VEGCd.webp) Then add one of the packets (or about one-third) of the coffee,![add coffee packet](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/Fig_10.BI1sCiPQ_Z1pKoKt.webp) Then, more water, another packet of coffee, more water, the rest of the coffee, and enough water to fill the cup. Like so:![add more water, more coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/Fig_11.B2Cxpd-e_1qyeQC.webp) If you do this just right, you shouldn’t need to stir it, but if you notice that the grounds are not getting all soaked just give it a gentle stir with a spoon. Then put the lid on and let it soak overnight.![secure lid](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/Fig_12.DgnVGXhG_Z1DJ4ql.webp) When the morning comes lift the top cup out of the bottom one and slide the cardboard spacer under it, and let the coffee drain.![stacked cups](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/Fig_13.BQGE6s8V_Z2wJENc.webp)![coffee in bottom cup](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/Fig_14.BNXltRCo_c2uWJ.webp)_Bottom cup with coffee_![empty top cup](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/Fig_16.v10jCInF_Z1z5B6.webp)_The top coffee is now empty._ This will take anywhere from a few minutes to over an hour, depending on several factors, like: - how coarse the coffee is ground - the size of the holes - the number of holes - how thoroughly do you want to drain the grounds? You can then pour concentrated coffee into the bottle. Just don’t pour all the dregs into it. Leave a little bit of the coffee behind, and you will have a bottle of pure coffee concentrate. You can keep it in the refrigerator for up to two weeks.![store cold brew coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/Fig_17.Cb6jxtYD_Z296OM7.webp)_Store cold brew coffee_### Enjoy your coffee Add about one ounce of concentrate to a cup of hot water, and now you are ready to sample cold brewed coffee. Not strong enough? Add more concentrate. It’s all up to you. Too strong? Add more hot water. That is one of the selling points of this method. You can brew it once and make it just the right strength for everyone in your house (or office) who drinks coffee. Or get some cold milk, flavored syrup and ice to add to your concentrate and make some great cold coffee drinks. ### A Few Notes First about coffee selection. I have read criticisms of this method from some people who describe the result as being rather bland and lacking in flavor. I was rather surprised by this, since my first exposure to it was very favorable, even though I like strong coffee. This first attempt of mine was made with standard store brand pre-ground auto-drip coffee. I later tried making this coffee with the pricier Arabica beans and was completely disappointed in the results. Experiment yourself, and let me know what your results are. Secondly, about the cardboard. It can tend to get soaked when sliding it under the dripping cup. If you want to mitigate this, cover it with packing tape so that the drips don’t soak in. Or, if you prefer, you could use more waterproof material, like the foam trays that are used for packaging produce. Thirdly, regarding temperature. You may notice that adding cold concentrate to hot water gives you a coffee that is not quite as hot as you are accustomed to. If that is the case, there are two things you can do. The first is to nuke it. Put it in the microwave until it is as warm as you like it. The second is to pre-warm your cup. This works great if you have a ceramic mug. Just fill it with hot tap water for a minute or so, then dump that out and fill it with the hot water and concentrate. The temperature will be as hot as coffee from the pot. Fourth, concerning quantity. If you have smaller cups, use what you have and adjust the amount of coffee you use. For example, two 20-ounce cups would be about right for two bags. You may be wondering about the durability of this no-cost soft drink cup brewing system. Does it matter? It doesn’t cost anything to make a new one, but as you must know, I have used the same system for nearly a year and only made another to take the pictures for this article. That’s all. Try some cold brew coffee and see if you like it. If not, you aren’t out the $30 for a brewing system. If you like it, you still aren’t out $30 unless you want to be. ### Resources [Cold Brew Coffee with the Toddy Coffee Maker](https://ineedcoffee.com/cold-brew-coffee-with-the-toddy-coffee-maker/) – An alternate cold coffee brewing method.

# Cold Weather Coffee Roasting [Roasting Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/roasting-coffee/)---by [Michael Allen Smith](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/michael-allen-smith/)![Cold Weather Coffee Roasting](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/cold-weather-coffee-roasting/westbend-the-poppery.jpg) I just had to leave Southern California, didn’t I? I have been home roasting coffee from San Diego for the past seven years without any problems. Unless my attention drifted during the roast, it was almost a sure thing the coffee would turn out great. Then I moved to Seattle, and I experienced something I almost forgot about: winter. It was not a Minnesota winter, but roasting just got 30-40 degrees F colder for me. Roasting coffee can be done indoors or outdoors. With my current pad, roasting on the outdoor patio is the only option. My smoke detector is hypersensitive and requires an acrobat to disable it. As the months went by and the temperature dropped, my roast times got longer and longer. A long roast where the temperature doesn’t get high enough results in a baked, tasteless coffee. ### A Tale of Three Cold Roasters I use three coffee roasters: [I-Roast 2](https://ineedcoffee.com/roasting-coffee-in-a-popcorn-popper/), [Behmor 1600](https://ineedcoffee.com/behmor-1600-coffee-roaster-tutorial/), and the [Westbend Poppery](https://ineedcoffee.com/roasting-coffee-in-a-popcorn-popper/). When the temperature dropped, I was still learning to use my new Behmor, so I leaned towards using the I-Roast. The roasts got longer and longer, and in the end, I gave up trying to get a consistent roast that didn’t taste flat.![iRoast2](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/roast41.CK94r7YZ_ZDo0Wf.webp)_iRoast 2_ After I gave up on the I-Roast, I considered using the Westbend Poppery. Several years ago, Ryan Jacobs taught us how to trap heat in the Poppery using a box in his article [Winter Home Roasting](https://ineedcoffee.com/cold-weather-coffee-roasting/). Popcorn popper roasting requires a higher level of _hands-on_ attention. Add a flammable box; you should not step away from the roast the entire time. The problem with this strategy was that I was cold. This was my first winter in eight years. I still needed time to acclimatize, but I needed freshly roasted coffee first.![Westbend Poppery](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/westbend-the-poppery.BuLpKUEG_1eFQEw.webp)_West Bend Poppery_ This left me with the Behmor 1600. Fortunately, Chris Arnold had an excellent tutorial, Behmor 1600 Coffee Roaster Tutorial, to get me started. Things were going great until the temperature dropped below 45F. Then, the machine started throwing ERR 1 codes. When the machine throws an ERR 1 code, it will not roast. After getting the ERR 1 codes multiple times, I gave up.![behmor 1600](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/behmor1.D0YRtlG7_1FNDDB.webp)_Behmor 1600 Coffee Roaster_### Surrendering to Seattle During my roasting frustration, I remembered my early home roasting days. It was the summer of 1998 and I was living in St. Petersburg, Florida. The coffee there was dreadful. Ryan Jacobs came down and gave me a hands-on roasting tutorial for my Poppery 2. That tutorial eventually became the [Roast your Own Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/roast-your-own-coffee/) article. Suddenly I had great coffee. Fast forward to the present. Seattle is nothing like St. Petersburg, Florida. There are so many outstanding coffee roasters in the area. So, I decided not to fight the cold weather on my balcony and embrace roasted coffee. I stopped home roasting. Between Caffe Vita, Victrola, 49th Parallel (from Trabant), and Zoka, I had lots of great coffee to keep me warm during the winter. ### The Cold Weather Coffee Comeback With no offense intended to the great roasters of Seattle, I found myself missing the one thing I couldn’t guarantee when buying roasted coffee: [freshness](https://ineedcoffee.com/why-home-roast/). Don’t get me wrong, all those roasters sell fresh coffee. But after a decade of home roasting, my definition of fresh is different than that of roasted coffee consumers. As a home roaster, I often throw out 7-10 days old beans. If I buy beans from a local roaster that are 5-7 days old already, my freshness window is closing fast. I needed to go back out to the balcony and tackle winter. The I-Roast would be my first challenge. I tried setting the machine in a box to trap heat, but that didn’t work. The I-Roast was losing heat from the top, so I blocked some airflow using black electrical tape. Not a good idea. The tape got hot and started to melt. It was a mess to clean up. Don’t use electrical tape to block airflow on the I-Roast. Although the tape was a bad idea, going after the airflow was the correct thinking. Digging through my cabinets, I found a small saucepan lid. Leaning the saucepan lid over the top trapped the air, and the roast time dropped. It was working well until the winds picked up. Then it was back to under-roasted coffee. The I-Roast went back into storage. That is when I decided to try the Behmor 1600 again. I needed to see if I could overcome the ERR 1 codes. The user guide’s description of ERR 1 says: > _Indicates the thermostat is damaged. Call tech support for immediate service._ I knew the machine was fine. It was just like me – it didn’t like cold weather. That got me thinking. When I don’t like cold weather, I go inside to warm up. Perhaps the Behmor just needed to sit inside the toasty warm house for an hour? I let it warm up inside and then take it back outside, and the ERR 1 code might go away. That worked. Once back outside, the electronics in the Behmor were warm enough to start the roast. The only additional thing I needed to do was increase the roast time by a few minutes to compensate for the cold weather. ### Happiness is a Warm Roaster If you are roasting in 35- 45F temperatures with the Behmor 1600, take the roaster inside an hour before you need to roast. Just before you take it back outside, plug it in and try to start an empty roast. It will either start or throw an ERR 1. If it works, hit the cool button, wait a few seconds, power it off, and then take it outside. You are ready to roast. If the ERR 1 still appears, wait another hour and try again. If it continues to throw ERR 1, you may have to call tech support. UPDATE: The most recent manual for the Behmor 1600 states that storing the roaster in an environment under 45F can cause the ERR 1 code.

# Using a Shop Vac to Quickly Cool Your Home Coffee Roast [Roasting Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/roasting-coffee/)---by [James Cameron](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/james-cameron/)![Using a Shop Vac to Quickly Cool Your Home Coffee Roast](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/cooling-your-coffee-beans/cooling1.jpg) The process of roasting your own coffee beans is easy once you have a basic understanding of how it works. Home roasting is catching on rapidly and has been touted as the fastest-growing hobby in the United States today. While simple, it does require some knowledge to produce roasts that are truly great. Understanding the entire process is mandatory in order to deliver the ultimate cup of coffee. ### The most overlooked part of home roasting The number one problem in producing great coffee roasted at home is the failure to cool the roast quickly after roasting. Coffee is “roasted” rather than “baked” and for good reason. When roasted properly at high heat quickly allowing convection between the heat source and beans as well as from bean to bean you will avoid “baking” your beans. The baking of coffee beans renders them flat and void of the brightness and zip they should have. Baking occurs when the beans are roasted too slowly or allowed to remain in a slowly decelerating heated situation. When this happens the coffee is losing the zip it has at peak of roast. The manufactured home roasters that I have seen or heard of all have the same problem; they lack a good cooling system. It is virtually impossible to cool your roast quickly enough in the same chamber that they were, moments ago, roasting in. We in the industry use sample roasters which are all outfitted with a separate cooling pan built to cool the roast as quickly as possible. We watch the roast checking it with a small scoop we insert into the roasting chamber about every 15 seconds when the roast is nearing the profile we desire. When the roast hits the desired profile we immediately dump it into a cool and operating cooling pan and generally stir it to speed the cooling along further. It is easy to build a very efficient cooling pan which I highly recommend. ### Building a Cooling Pan To build an in-expensive, simple cooling pan that works very well, you will need: - One of those 5-gallon buckets like at the bakery or Home Depot WITH THE COVER. - A large stainless steel mixing bowl - A couple of draw hasps (National Hardware # N208-512 V35) (Bungee cords will work – if you’re less mechanical) - A 1×1 (1 gallon/1 hp) shop vac. I bought one yesterday at Wal-Mart for $19.99 - Wooden spoon Cut the top of the bucket so the steel bowl fits snugly on top of the bucket. Drill several hundred little (1/8″ or smaller) holes only in the bottom of the bowl (colander will not work because the holes go up the sides). Cut a little hole 3 – 4 inches from the bottom into the side of the bucket so the vacuum cleaner hose will fit into the bucket SNUGLY. With the steel bowl snugly fastened on the top and the shop vac snugly in the hole, you will have a very strong downward draft through the holes in the bottom of the bowl. This makes an excellent cooling pan!![Cooling Coffee Bean Setup](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/cooling1.BRiNBxcZ_Z25XGdI.webp)_Cooling Coffee Bean Setup_ There are other, even easier ways including a 12-inch box fan blowing downward with a colander resting on top. Next time you roast, make an effort to cool your roast as quickly as you can and taste the difference. When everything is done right, your coffee will be noticeably better in the cup and that is why we roast our own. ### Resources [Roasting Coffee in a Popcorn Popper](https://ineedcoffee.com/roasting-coffee-in-a-popcorn-popper/) – Tutorial on using a Westbend popcorn popper to home roast coffee.

# Colombian Coffee [Coffee History](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/coffee-history/)---by [Chris Arnold](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/chris-arnold/)![Colombian Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/colombian-coffee/juanvaldez1.jpg) Nothing represents coffee in the American psyche more than Juan Valdez and his mountain-grown Colombian coffee. In 1959, we were introduced to the fictional character, complete with sombrero and poncho for effect, alongside his trusty donkey, or burro. Of course, this marketing campaign resurrected the idea of 100% Arabica coffee after many years of the big coffee can companies slowly slipping in more and more low-quality robusta, along with the prevalence of the percolator. I think this was a good thing, and perhaps was one important step in the resurgence of specialty grade coffee in America, worthy of proper preparation. No doubt, it was a great first step on a long road for American coffee drinkers in the last 50 years, piquing with none other than Starbucks coffee.![Juan Valdez](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/juanvaldez1.xZYwVJ5-_iuyWM.webp)_Juan Valdez_ Colombian Coffees are thought to have reached Colombia in the 1500s along with Jesuit priests. Export of the first Colombian coffee bean began in 1835 with just over 2000 bags. Now exports of Colombian coffee beans worldwide are in the millions, making up about 11-14% of the world’s production. You can find mainly Maragogype, Caturra, Typica, and Bourbon cultivars grown in Colombia today. While Brazilian coffee is #1 volume-wise, and Colombian had held the #2 spot for a long time, recently Vietnam slipped in ahead of Colombia pushing it to the #3 spot. Of course, Vietnamese coffee is the lower quality robusta, so the quality difference between the beans is clear. I would much rather have a cup of Colombian coffee than Vietnamese robusta coffee any day. Sometimes incorrectly spelled _Columbian coffee_ or _Columbia coffee_, it is known for perfect balance and heavy body. Exclusively arabica coffee, it is grown at high altitudes, in the shade of native trees. The volcanic soil and dry climate provide excellent growing conditions. There are two main coffee-growing regions in Colombia: the Central Region and the Eastern Region. The Central Region of Colombia is known as “MAM”. MAM stands for Medellin, Armenia, and Manizales. The Eastern Region of Colombia is a mountainous area around Bogota and Bucaramanga. They are all known for their heavy body and richness, but the Eastern Region tends to have lower acidity than the MAM area.![Colombia Map](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/colombiamap-480x650.CcZn-jka_ZPYQQX.webp)_Colombia Map_ Maybe you grew up on _Folgers Colombian Coffee_ like me, and of course realize now that just because something is 100% Colombian, does not mean that it tastes good. In fact, due to efforts to increase volume, the quality of the Colombian coffee bean has gone down substantially in recent years. This has to do with both the processing and the fact that more and more coffee out of Colombia is not Specialty Grade. While the monikers of Colombian Supremo and Colombian Excelso may have meant something at one time (they are screen sizes), they have come to have a watered-down meaning and are largely irrelevant. Many grocery store-grade coffees will use these terms, but their coffee is palatable at best. The real Colombian coffees now will tout their very specific growing regions, and even then, there are many average coffee lots to be had. Some of these regions are Huila, Santander, Popayan, and Narino, to name a few. What can you expect to do with Colombian coffee? Well, that is what is great – Colombian coffee is very versatile. I hate to use the term “Classic Cup”, but it fits Colombia to a tee. I enjoy it as a 100% drip after dinner or as a blend as an espresso shot. In fact, before the recent rise in Brazil’s coffee quality, many coffeehouses used Colombian coffee as a large part of their espresso blends. And of course, the French Press is where this stuff shines. Many coffees are a little too bold for me in the French Press, but Colombian is great. And for the home coffee roaster who wonders, I tend to take the Colombian just into 2nd crack a few seconds, and it generally works out perfectly. Are you interested in seeing this coffee-growing region firsthand? Although Colombia has been known in the past for cocaine and kidnapping, a lot has changed in recent times. Coffee tourism in the region is on the rise. Many trips include guided tours to Colombia and several surrounding areas such as Brazil, Ecuador, and Panama. Hikes provide an up-close view of the coffee trees. Other activities include coffee roasting, coffee cupping of freshly roasted premium coffee, and of course meeting the people who work so hard to make our cup of coffee affordable and enjoyable. Do yourself a favor and book a Colombia coffee tour now. And if you do get kidnapped, look at the bright side – maybe you will get some of the best coffee on the planet, straight from the source while in captivity. On a serious note, Kidnap and Ransom Insurance is never a bad idea when traveling to certain countries. Always check the latest US Government Travel Warnings and use good common sense. Oh yeah, say hi to Juan for me…if you see him! ### Resources [Coffee and Brazil – How Coffee Molded the Culture of a Country](https://ineedcoffee.com/coffee-and-brazil-how-coffee-molded-the-culture-of-a-country/) – INeedCoffee article.

# Cowboy Coffee Recipe – 1865 Arbuckle’s Grocery [Brewing Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/brewing-coffee/)---by [CB Miller](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/cb-miller/)![Cowboy Coffee Recipe – 1865 Arbuckle’s Grocery](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/cowboy-coffee-arbuckles/cowboy-coffee-recipe-arbuckles-matt-lee.jpg) With Comstock’s Wild West heritage, we thought it only fitting to say a few words this month about Cowboy Coffee and the brand that became synonymous with coffee ’round the campfire: Arbuckle. Cowboy coffee was not a brand but a brewing method developed, naturally enough, by the roaming cowboys of the prairie out of necessity. Surprisingly, it is similar to the ancient practice of Turkish coffee but not as refined. Cowhands expected their coffee to be ‘brown gargle”, hot, black, strong, and thick enough to float a six-shooter in. It is ironic to realize that, whatever you think about the taste before 1865, cowboys drank fresher coffee than most Americans do today. That was because, though preparing coffee on the range was a tedious and time-consuming task, cooks had no choice but to buy green coffee and roast it fresh in a skillet before brewing. In contrast to most of today’s supermarket brands -coffee is roasted months in advance and kept stored in cans before finally appearing in your cup. Like today’s consumer, though, for the cowboy on the range, convenience was the key. In 1865, when Arbuckle’s Grocery in Pittsburgh developed a special roasting and coating technique that kept beans tasty for long periods, it soon became the cowboy’s brand. Arbuckle had devised a special egg and sugar glaze that sealed flavor in the roasted bean. Soon, cowhands were asking for Arbuckle at cow camps and ranch houses across the prairie.![Cowboy Coffee near campfire](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/cowboy-coffee-campfire-tim-wright.O9NUL2eo_Z1IlQ9W.webp)_Photo by [Tim Wright](https://web.archive.org/web/20180911013254/https://unsplash.com/@timdwright)_### Recipe for COWBOY COFFEE - 4 qt. water - 1 1/2 cups freshly ground coffee ([coarse grind](https://ineedcoffee.com/coffee-grind-chart/) – same as French Press) - 1 eggshell - 1/2 cup cold water Bring water to a boil in a large saucepan or coffee pot. Add coffee grounds and an eggshell to boiling water. Return to a boil, remove from heat, and let stand for 2 minutes. Slowly add cold water to settle the grounds to the bottom. Let stand for 1 minute to allow the grounds to settle. Use any remaining coffee to extinguish the campfire. Now, don’t be surprised if, in a wave of nostalgia for the pioneer days, you attempt to brew your own Cowboy Coffee and find it less than palatable. Our suggestion is that you add some sugar to this potent brew or take your chances. We suspect that is what made Arbuckle’s coffee so popular: their egg and sugar glaze probably added just enough sweetness to satisfy the palate without offending the big, tough ranchers ‘taste for adventure. Also, unless you normally consume a gallon of coffee, you might want to scale the recipe down a bit. _Yippie Oh Kiay, podnuh!_![arbuckles coffee wooden crate](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/arbuckles-coffee-clem-onojeghuo.C6uhQlFW_Z1dNQVJ.webp)_Photo by_ _Clem Onojeghuo_### Resources [Cowboy Coffee, Backpacker Style](https://ineedcoffee.com/cowboy-coffee-backpacker-style/) – INeedCoffee article with a recipe.

# Cowboy Coffee, Backpacker Style [Brewing Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/brewing-coffee/)---by [Joe Poerschke](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/joe-poerschke/)![Cowboy Coffee, Backpacker Style](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/cowboy-coffee-backpacker-style/cowboy-coffee-backpacker-tim-wright.jpg) I love cowboy coffee. If not so much for the taste, as for the setting. I do a lot of backpacking. I used to use those coffee bags and then discovered cowboy coffee out of necessity when I couldn’t find the bags in the _podunk_ town General Store near the trailhead. When you figure out how to make cowboy coffee it usually tastes better than the bags. Additionally, I feel OK dumping coffee grounds though I always pack the bags out with me. ### Overview 1. Bring one quart of water to a boil in a saucepan. 2. Add 3/4 cup of ground coffee. 3. Return to a boil. 4. Immediately remove from heat and cover. 5. Wait till the grounds sink (approximately 5 minutes). 6. Serve. ### How Fine to Grind? The finer you grind the coffee, the faster the flavor will extract. If you brew too long, the coffee could taste bitter. The upside is that the finer grounds will sink more easily at the end of the brew. If you decide to use coarser ground coffee to reduce the risk of bitterness and over-extraction, you will need a spoon or something to scrape off the floating ground coffee. My advice is to start with a drip grind and adjust up or down from there based on whatever tastes best and works best for you. See our [Coffee Grind Chart](https://ineedcoffee.com/coffee-grind-chart/) for a visual explanation. ### ![Cowboy Coffee on campfire](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/cowboy-coffee-alex-holt.Dksz-A1b_q0tWS.webp)_Cowboy Coffee by Alex Holt_### The Keys to Cowboy Coffee The first key to making decent cowboy coffee is process repetition. Measure the water and the coffee to ensure a consistent ratio every time. I use about 50% more coffee grounds than I do for an equivalent amount of water in my home ADC coffee maker. I live in Albuquerque at an elevation of 5,000 feet. When you hike above 10,000 feet, the boiling temperature goes way down, and you need to add considerably more coffee grounds. If you live at normal altitudes, it’s not much of a consideration. So measure your water and get it boiling, that’s step one. Step two is adding the coffee grounds. I like letting it return to a boil for just long enough to wet the grounds. Be very watchful though as a minute of boiling and the taste goes downhill. The caveat here is elevation; at 10,000 feet boiling for a minute seems OK bitter-wise and necessary to get any flavor at all. ### Don’t Add Cold Water I’ve read about adding cold water to sink the grounds. Grounds sink when they cool. Adding cold water makes cold coffee. I never add water. The grounds usually sink in 5 minutes, quicker if the air is cold. If it’s over say, 70° F, after 5 minutes I take the lid off the pan for 5 seconds, put it back on, and in one minute the grounds will be settled. The fresh air cools the grounds and they fall, leaving the rest of the brew as warm as possible. ### Keeping The Coffee Warm I carefully select where I’m going to set my pan of coffee. I always make numerous cups. After the 5 minutes of _brewing_ the spot on the ground becomes warm and helps keep the remaining coffee warm. Sand or other soft ground works best, gravelly surfaces are the worst as they let lots of airflow by the bottom of the pan. Always insulate your pot somehow. Usually, I wrap it in a jacket or clothing, though in the winter, your sleeping bag works the best. The ultimate is sand. I dig a hole, put my pot of coffee in it, and push the sand up around the sides. Dribble a little bit of water around the outside of the pan, and in 5 minutes, when you pull the pot out of the hole, the heat and moisture will hold the sand in perfect shape.![cowboy coffee brewing](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/cowboy-coffee-brewing.D_STXrI9_1hEjDK.webp)_[Photo](http://www.flickr.com/photos/or4n6e/2811499395/in/photostream/) of GSI Outdoors Percolator by Sarah Nuehring_ It’s good to set the pot somewhere with a mild slope. This way the grounds settle into the corner of the pan instead of evenly on the bottom. When you pour the coffee handle the pot as gently as possible so as not to disturb the grounds. Best to maintain the slope the pan has been sitting at and pour by tilting in that direction. Hold the cup near the pot, and move the pot as little as possible. ### Not “Good to the Last Drop” Just like a finely brewed Turkish blend, cowboy coffee is not expected to be good until the last drop. It’s a good habit to learn to throw away the last tablespoon or so of each cup so as to avoid consumption of the bitter solids. Grounds and water fly out of the pot nicely with a flick of the wrist. Distribute evenly over the land. Non-immersed grounds like to stick to the pot and each other. I think scattered single grounds qualify as _leave no trace_, while a big pile of grounds does not. I don’t like to spend any more resources cleaning pots than absolutely necessary. ### Percolators on the Trails I’ve seen all manner of camping coffee devices for sale. I finished my whole pot of coffee while friends were still waiting for their percolator to perk an ever so slightly tastier cup of joe. My method is somewhat simple, requires zero overhead, and has worked wonders for me for five years. I’ve received many compliments on my coffee, normally _wow, this is a surprisingly good cup of coffee_, usually from the _frou-frou_ coffee-making device set. ### Why I Wrote this Article Outside magazine did an article on backpacking coffee makers a few years ago. They began with a diss of cowboy coffee; then, they proceeded to tout all these heavy and expensive devices. I wrote them a complaint letter and stated that I felt they were trying to _sell_ coffee makers. I suggested that a **how-to** article on cowboy coffee creation would have been much more appropriate than saying _we’ve all had cold, awful cowboy coffee, straining the ground through our teeth_. In that letter, I requested that my gift subscription be canceled. I suppose this attempt at an article is my attempt to right that wrong. I’ve never seen an article on making cowboy coffee. Once I figured it out, I taught my Dad (who has been camping his whole life). Now he’s hooked too. An added bonus is that when I spend the night in a non-coffee drinker’s house, I only need to bring some grounds to get my early morning fix. ### Resources [Cowboy Coffee: Arbuckles](https://ineedcoffee.com/cowboy-coffee-arbuckles/) – Cowboy Coffee article with a recipe.

# Costa Rica Coffee History [Coffee History](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/coffee-history/)---by [Stefanie Spencer](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/stefanie-spencer/)![Costa Rica Coffee History](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/costa-rica-coffee-history/Costa-Rica-Coffee-History.jpg) Seeing the lush, green valleys and beautiful mountains of Costa Rica from the air as we were landing in San Jose’ was not even the tip of the iceberg concerning the richness of this country. Home to roughly 5% of the world’s biodiversity and having the most number of species per 10,000 sq km in the world, hundreds of birds, mammals, reptiles and amphibians can be found here, along with a staggering 10,000 plant and tree species! Costa Rica is also the habitat of a number of rare and endangered flora and fauna species such as the Scarlet Macaw, the resplendent quetzal, and the West Indian Manatee. ¹  The rich volcanic soil, cool, moist climate, and high altitude of the mountains, just part of the 12 different ecological zones, is the perfect place for growing excellent coffee. In the past, some Costa Rican coffee was said to be too clean, too balanced, too mild, and the “classic cup,” possibly just boring. However, today there are many farmers and micro-mills that take extreme care in every part of the process and produce a variety of excellent, diverse coffees.![Costa Rica Coffee Farmer](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/costa-rica-coffee-farmer1.Daf_5SgL_Z1WwBTf.webp)_Costa Rica Coffee Farmer_ The coffee Arabica plant was brought to the Central Valley of Costa Rica in the late 1700s. Cultivation spread slowly, and Costa Rica became the first Central American country to have a coffee industry. Coffee growing soon surpassed cacao, tobacco, and sugar in importance, and by 1829 it had become the major source of foreign revenue. As a nonperishable commodity in an age of slow and costly transport, coffee proved an ideal product. It shortly thereafter became the nation’s major export, a position it has maintained until recent years. It created a producer’s wealthy elite that dominated the governmental circles all through the second half of the 19th century. ²![Costa Rica Coffee Plant](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/costa-rica-coffee-plant.C14u82-Z_LP8hf.webp)_Costa Rica Coffee Plant_ Exports to Panama began in the 1820s, and around 1832 Chile became a major customer. Chile re-branded and exported the Costa Rican coffee to England under the name of “Cafe Chileno de Valparaiso.” In 1843, a shipment was sent directly to the United Kingdom by William Le Lacheur Lyon, captain of the English ship The Monarch, who had seen the potential of directly cooperating with the Costa Ricans. He sent several hundred-pound bags, and following this, the British developed an interest in the country. They invested heavily in the Costa Rican coffee industry, becoming the principal customer for exports until World War II. ³![Costa Rica Coffee Beans](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/costa-rica-coffee-beans-green.DSYCf-B9_Z1DlTDW.webp)_Costa Rica Coffee Beans_ Costa Rica was then known around the world for its coffee. The growing and trading of coffee changed the face of this humble colony. The country was modernized and young Costa Rican intellectuals could now continue their studies in Europe and return as doctors, engineers, and entrepreneurs, contributing to the improvement of Costa Ricans’ lifestyle. The economic bounty that coffee production and trade gave birth to allow the country to build the first railroads to the Atlantic Coast in 1890, “Ferrocarril al Atlantico.”![Kids on a Costa Rica Coffee Farm](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/kids-on-costa-rica-coffee-farm.Du-uEqZD_2nni64.webp)_Kids on a Costa Rica Coffee Farm_ The awed inhabitants of the capital of Costa Rica, San Jose, attended the memorable inauguration of the National Theater seven years later. The National Theater is the cradle of Costa Rican culture and a monument to the foresight of the first coffee farmers. 4 Costa Rica is an example of a country that, through the ingenuity of entrepreneurs, was transformed by something as simple as a coffee plant. ### Resources ¹  [Scarlet Macaws prove to be one of the more vibrant residents of Costa Rica](https://www.govisitcostarica.com/travelInfo/flora-fauna/vibrant-scarlet-macaw.asp) ²  [http://www.infocostarica.com/business/eco\_coffee.html](http://www.infocostarica.com/business/eco%5C_coffee.html) (site down January 2015) ³  [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffee_production_in_Costa_Rica#cite_note-ted-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffee_production_in_Costa_Rica#cite_note-ted-1) 4 [http://www.aventura-cafe.com/costarica-eng.htm](http://www.aventura-cafe.com/costarica-eng.htm) (site down October 2014) [My Coffee Tis of Thee: America’s Patriotic Coffee History](https://ineedcoffee.com/my-coffee-tis-of-thee/) – America’s coffee history.

# Cowboy Coffee Chew and Major League Coffee Dip Review [Coffee and Health](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/coffee-health/)---by [Chris Arnold](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/chris-arnold/)![Cowboy Coffee Chew and Major League Coffee Dip Review](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/cowboy-coffee-chew-and-major-league-coffee-dip-review/DSC01198.jpg) Thoughts of the old west often conjure up images of cowboys sitting around the campfire drinking [Cowboy Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/cowboy-coffee-backpacker-style/) and chewing tobacco. Those tough old cowboys would probably laugh at us today with our latte art and the fact that spittoons have all but disappeared. Cue the laughter and enter Coffee Chew/Dip, a Tobacco-free & Nicotine-free alternative to chewing or dipping smokeless tobacco from Chew Coffee Dip. They currently offer “Cowboy Coffee Chew” and “Major League Coffee Dip”. They are actually the exact same product inside, only the container is different. Each 1.4oz/39g tin contains Freshly Ground Coffee, Honey, Sugar, and Cream, and has been commercially manufactured in the USA, and tested and verified for consumption.![Chew Coffee Major League Coffee Dip and Cowboy Coffee Chew](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/DSC01198-561x650.CcsPOnuW_7853r.webp) Chew Coffee Dip suggests that you can use their product as a replacement for chewing or dipping smokeless tobacco, or can be mixed into your current brand of smokeless chewing tobacco dip. Not being a smokeless tobacco user myself, I decided to pack some in the side of my mouth as the “pros” do. I didn’t find much satisfaction in leaving it there, and within a minute, I was already starting to chew and eat the product. It is delicious, and it should be; it’s got ground coffee, honey, sugar, and cream. Who wouldn’t find that delightful? NOTE: It is recommended to use the product warm, by placing it in your pocket, but I found no difference in the flavor or consistency. Within a few minutes, I felt a slight buzz from all those ingredients, and I took another hit. This stuff is addictive.![Chew Coffee Major League Coffee Dip and Cowboy Coffee Chew](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/DSC01196-650x433.B8_BQL8M_21U2MU.webp) If you are trying to quit smokeless tobacco, this might be the ticket. Maybe for some, just having something flavorful in your mouth will be enough to wean yourself from dipping. Or maybe you will need to combine the two for a more effective program. At about $6 per tin*, this stuff ain’t cheap but could be an important step in your path to better health, or as a quick and convenient pick-me-up._*The price is closer to $4.30 a tin when you buy 6 or 12 at a time._### Resources [Cowboy Coffee, Backpacker Style](https://ineedcoffee.com/cowboy-coffee-backpacker-style/) – INeedCoffee article.

# Creating the Sketchtoon Coffee Calendar [Cafe Culture](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/cafe-culture/)---by [Michael Rohde](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/michael-rohde/)![Creating the Sketchtoon Coffee Calendar](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/creating-the-sketchtoon-coffee-calendar/sketchtoon-coffee-calendar1.jpg) A few years ago, my wife and I went looking for coffee-themed calendars to be used as gifts for coffee-loving friends. We were very surprised to find none in the calendar kiosks at the local malls or coffee shops and very few to choose from online. Being creative people, we decided to create our calendars and print them on Cafe Press. Our first calendar used black-and-white photos and was received very well by our two friends. About the same time, I’d been working on a drawing style I had created called [_Sketchtoons_](http://www.flickr.com/photos/rohdesign/sets/737758/) where I mixed loose sketches with hand-written notes in my Moleskine sketchbook. I decided to do a new calendar, creating _Sketchtoons_ for 12 coffee drinks. In this article, I’ll document how I came up with the ideas, drew, scanned, and colorized them for use in calendars and other items, and then marketed and sold the calendar with no budget.![sketchtoon coffee calendar](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/sketchtoon-coffee-calendar1.DDWy2e3E_2ngxex.webp)_[Sketchtoon Coffee Calendar](http://www.flickr.com/photos/rohdesign/2111160077/in/set-72157600161864325/) by Mike Rohde_### Concepts and Research The first task was to select which coffee drinks I would feature for each of the 12 months of the year. I had the classics settled (espresso, latte, mocha, cappuccino, iced coffee, cafe au lait) but needed several more unique drinks, which were not available on any other calendar, to round it out. For this I turned to Wikipedia, searching first for classic coffee drinks, then following links on those entries to find unusual drinks like the [Flat White](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flat_white) and [Greek Frappe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frapp%C3%A9_coffee). This worked wonderfully, as there was good historical and technical information I could use to create customized text for my _Sketchtoons_. ### Sketching Once I’d selected my 12 drinks and had reference materials gathered, it was time to start the sketching process. Using a Moleskine Pocket Sketchbook, I first penciled out the structure of each drawing and then created the illustrations on the page. The last step: drawing the title of the drink and writing in the text on the left and right sides. ### Scanning and Colorization Once the illustrations were complete, I scanned each drawing from the Moleskine, then created a master high-resolution Photoshop file, with each illustration on a separate layer. Next, I created a common background image of rough, dark brown texture on the top and bottom of each drawing, and created 4 background colors to cycle through the 12 months. Each illustration was then colorized, using layers above each background color for the white tones, cup, and coffee colors, and lightened areas behind the descriptive text:![latte - sketch - rohde](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/latte.DUbn5GqZ_ZlLg3g.webp) Once the colorization was completed, I exported each illustration, with colorized layers, to a single, high-resolution PNG file (created to specs provided by Cafe Press for the calendar). Each PNG graphic was uploaded to Cafe Press, and finalized with a description and pricing choices. Cafe Press items have base prices, on top of which you may add a specific dollar amount for your profit. [Sketchtoon Coffee Calendar (Cover)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/rohdesign/2111160077/) [Sketchtoon Coffee Calendar February (Espresso)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/rohdesign/2111161013/) ### Marketing and Sales I didn’t have a budget for marketing, though I do have my [Rohdesign blog](https://rohdesign.com/) with a fair number of readers. I shared details of the calendar: drawings, and when the calendar went up for sale as well as follow-up postings. I also added a link to the Cafe Press page for the calendar in my email signature and [uploaded images of the calendar](http://www.flickr.com/photos/rohdesign/sets/72157600161864325/) to my Flickr account. INeedCoffee.com also provided exposure, as I had been a contributor on the page, I was able to submit a small ad for the site and on my [contributor profile page](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/michael-rohde/). I’ve recently purchased an iPod Touch, and one of the options is to install your wallpaper on the startup screen. I decided to take the artwork from the calendar and create [vertical wallpapers](http://www.flickr.com/photos/rohdesign/sets/72157603305471752/) for each illustration. Being a former Palm PDA user, I realized a square format version would be nice to offer to Palm and classic iPod users, so I created a [square set](http://www.flickr.com/photos/rohdesign/sets/72157603340996811/) too. The free wallpapers were popular, and though I can only connect one download of the wallpapers to a sale, I think it helped expose the calendar to more people. Finally, I chose two local coffee shops I frequent and gave each of them a calendar as a thank-you. This also may work as exposure to other coffee lovers who see the calendars hanging in their shops. ### Conclusion In the end, I sold 80 calendars through Cafe Press and received many compliments on the calendar from those who bought them for others or themselves. Our friend who started this project was very pleased with hers. Based on this year’s calendar project, I would change a few things, mainly getting the calendar ready in September rather than November, allowing buyers to see it sooner. All in all, I found the project a very interesting experiment, which I think went quite well. I’m planning a revised version of the same calendar design for 2009, and am considering a new calendar with different designs and possibly a different theme. If you’re considering creating your calendar, check out Cafe Press. It’s free and pretty easy to set up an account, and you might even earn enough money to take your friends out for a coffee.

# Decaf Coffee Methods [Brewing Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/brewing-coffee/)---by [Stefanie Spencer](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/stefanie-spencer/)![Decaf Coffee Methods](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/decaf-coffee-methods/caffeine-breakfast-of-champions1.jpg) Can decaf taste just as good as regular coffee? Is it processed with chemicals? Can it be decaffeinated without chemicals? Is there a coffee plant that does not contain caffeine at all? After it is decaffeinated does it still contain some caffeine? The answer to all of these is yes! There are many various methods used to decaffeinate regular coffee and there is development underway to improve the taste of coffee plants that contain a low amount of caffeine or none at all. Many people assume that decaf coffee can not possibly taste as good as regular, but it can. It depends on the original quality of the coffee beans, the method used to decaffeinate them, and then the time between roasting and consumption. Often decafs are not top sellers and so they tend to sit on the shelf longer; just make sure the one you choose was freshly roasted. ### The Solvent Method The process starts with dried, green (unroasted) coffee beans which are soaked in water. After swelling, they are processed with a solvent, which can be plain water or a chemical. After the beans are moistened, the solvent is circulated through the beans, evaporated and condensed to clean the solvent, and then circulated through the beans again. After the desired caffeine level is reached, the beans are rinsed with water, sometimes steamed to remove the remainder of the solvent, and then dried. Some solvents are more precise than water at removing the caffeine while leaving behind the other elements, which means in the end it will retain more of its flavor. The solvent ethyl acetate is an ester that is found naturally in fruits and vegetables such as bananas and apples, and it is found in coffee. Coffee that has been processed with ethyl acetate is labeled as “naturally decaffeinated” because the solvent is naturally found in these food items. However, other solvents, such as methylene chloride, may be harmful and possibly carcinogenic.[1] Because of this, it is very important to know which solvent is being used, and if methylene chloride is used, the label can not say “naturally decaffeinated.”![Caffeine - Breakfast of Champions ](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/caffeine-breakfast-of-champions1.CqXn86vi_2t4Udv.webp)_[Caffeine – Breakfast of Champions](http://www.flickr.com/photos/23502889@N04/2967172494/in/photostream/) by Fun in NH_### CO2 – “Naturally Decaffeinated” A newer method uses carbon dioxide (CO2) as the solvent to extract the caffeine. CO2 is the gas that makes sparkling mineral water and our favorite can of soda bubbly, and it is a highly selective solvent for caffeine, leaving behind the remainder of the bean that will ensure a great taste. The green beans are moistened with water and put into a pressurized container of liquid CO2. After the circulation process to remove the caffeine the beans are dried again to their initial state. This produces “naturally decaffeinated” beans since the substances, CO2 and water, are naturally occurring and evaporate completely.[2,4] ### Swiss Water Process The water method uses only water as the solvent to remove the caffeine, but depending on the process, the taste can vary from okay to great. The problem with water is that not only does it remove the caffeine, but it also removes other flavor elements in the coffee beans. One water process that reduces the problem is this. First, a batch of green beans are soaked in water, removing some of the caffeine and some of the flavor elements; these are the sacrificial beans because they are then tossed after they have been soaked. The liquid they were in is the important part; it is filtered through activated charcoal that has been pretreated with a carbohydrate and this charcoal is used to remove the caffeine, leaving behind the other coffee particles. The liquid is now the water that another batch of green beans is placed into, and because the water is already saturated with flavor elements, mostly the caffeine is removed and not the flavor. This process is repeated, filtering out the caffeine from the water and recirculating it through the beans until the desired levels are reached. The beans are then rinsed and dried. The water process is considered all-natural, but it can only remove 94% to 96% of the caffeine.[1] The Swiss Water(R) Process, a special patented water process, was developed to remove up to 99.9% of the caffeine while still retaining the coffee’s flavors. [3] ### Low Caffeine or No Caffeine Plants Lastly, scientists and plant breeders are working on developing a coffee plant that does not contain caffeine or has lower amounts of caffeine. One of 2008’s “most interesting new species discovered by scientists” is the first known [coffee plant that contains no caffeine](https://ineedcoffee.com/the-naturally-caffeine-free-coffee-plant/). It is known as Charrier coffee and was discovered in Cameroon.[5] They are hoping to use this new species to breed more naturally caffeine-free coffees. There are currently a few other coffee plants that are low in caffeine, but none of these have met the taste standards that consumers demand.[6] Other scientists are going down the genetic engineering road and have discovered the enzymes that are involved in the caffeine-making process. Currently, their genetically modified coffee plants have 70% less caffeine.[7] Decaffeination is a hot topic and generally misunderstood, but now maybe I have cleared a few things up. Decaf coffee can taste just as good as regular, but it depends on the process that is used, the overall age of the coffee, and how long it has been since it was roasted. Go directly to a roaster, find out what method of decaffeination is used, and make sure it is freshly roasted, and you might have an unbelievably awesome cup of decaffeinated coffee. ### References [1] [How is caffeine removed to produce decaffeinated coffee?](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-is-caffeine-removed-t/) – From Scientific American.

# Dads and Grads – A Coffee Gift Buying Guide [Cafe Culture](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/cafe-culture/)---by [Chris Arnold](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/chris-arnold/)![Dads and Grads – A Coffee Gift Buying Guide](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/dads-and-grads-a-coffee-gift-buying-guide/aeropress-secure-filter.jpg) No matter what the occasion, it is sometimes hard to come up with coffee-related gift ideas, especially if you already have a budget in mind. Here is a gift-buying guide for all budgets that should help you satisfy the coffee aficionado in your life, whether they be a Dad or a Grad. ### Under $25 A drip cone. Melitta cones are the most well-known. There are other options like the [Clever Coffee Dripper](https://ineedcoffee.com/clever-coffee-dripper-review/) that allow you more control over the brewing time before you release it into your cup. Bonavita makes a ceramic version. With the correct temp water, you will have an easy and delicious cup of coffee. Coffee Storage with a proper one-way valve is key to keeping your beans fresh. The Friis Coffee Vault is the one I own, and it works great. About $20 for the Stainless Steel model. Cups. They can be espresso cups, latte cups, cappuccino cups, or just regular coffee cups. My previous favorite, Illy cups are a little harder to find these days, but there are other brands like Konitz that are very nice, and quite a bit less expensive starting at about $20 per set. ### Under $75 Basic French Press. The French Press needs a coarse grind, so hopefully, your recipient has a grinder that is up to snuff. These can be well under $25, but the nicer ones start around $40 and go up from there. Aeropress by Aerobie. Yes, the same guys who made the frisbee. They have this very cool little coffee gadget. It makes coffee somewhere between an espresso machine and a Vac-pot. Around $30.![](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/aeropress-setup.CZoTtITh_ZpoLEg.webp)*Aeropress Coffee and Espresso Maker * How about a mug that doesn’t fall over when you bump it? The Mighty Mug has a slight suction on the bottom that will grip smooth surfaces. ### Under $150 Fancy French Press (Press Pot). There are some that are decorative, some that are thermal carafes, and others that boast a special filter. In the end, they do just as well as the basic models when it comes to the results. These range from about $50-$100. French Press and Grinder to match. The Baratza Encore grinder is a great little grinder for the price. If you want to get your special someone the complete package on the way to better coffee, nothing is better than a quality grinder and a French Press of your choosing. About $130. An electronically controlled hot water pot. I like the Zojirushi Electric Dispensing Pot which is the one I own. They have 3 temp levels (175F, 195F, and 208F). Perfect temps for Green Tea, Coffee, and things like soups and regular tea. I know folks who have had them for going on 10 years. Around $125 for the 4 Liter model. ### Under $500 A small-batch hot-air coffee roaster. The FreshRoast makes a nice little roaster, though the batches will be pretty small. About $175. A decent drip coffee machine that brews at the right temperature. The Technivorm was the go-to, but Bonavita has given it some serious competition at a much lower price point than the Bonavita BV1800. No fancy electronics on either, but a great cup of coffee to be sure. Choose a Thermal Carafe model from either make, and you should be served well. About $200-300. A real blender for those summer cold coffee drinks or that hot morning brain food concoction with coffee, oil, and butter. I have owned a BlendTec for over 3 years, and I don’t think I would own anything else. About $350-400. ### Under $1000 A consumer-grade drum coffee roaster. The Gene Cafe is a very nice roaster that will not break the bank. Some nice programming features and a compact design make it a nice choice for someone who needs larger batches than something like FreshRoast offers. About $600. A consumer-grade espresso machine. The [Rancilio Silvia](https://ineedcoffee.com/rancilio-silvia-espresso-machine-tips/) is a great machine in this price range. If you really want to be a hero, include a grinder. The Rancilio Rocky is a great match. About $1000 total ($650 for the machine, and $350 for the grinder). ### Under $2500 A prosumer espresso machine. I have owned the IZZO Alex Duetto 3 Espresso machine for over two years now, and this thing is the real deal. Dual boilers, PID temp control, tank or plumb-in, quiet rotary pump, beautiful looks, and much more. Oh yeah, it makes a damn fine (and consistent) shot of espresso. About $2500. ### Under $5000 A prosumer fluid air bed coffee roaster. I have owned the Sonofresco 1100-R 1 lb coffee roaster for years now, and it is truly a one-press operation. They now offer a 2 lb model, as well as Propane and Natural Gas options. Replacement parts are easy to get, and everything is made to last.  Around $3500-$5000, depending on the model._*Disclosure: INeedCoffee received a Mighty Mug to test._ Published on June 7, 2015--- #### Chris Arnold Chris is the creator of Two Bit History.

# Cupping: The Elements of Quality Coffee [Brewing Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/brewing-coffee/)---by [Christopher Schaefer](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/christopher-schaefer/)![Cupping: The Elements of Quality Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/cupping-the-elements-of-quality-coffee/coffee-cupping1.jpg) Many factors are involved when determining what coffee to buy and roast is good. A cut-and-dry approach that works for all beans does not exist. Different beans have different qualities and different palates will discriminate. The purpose of this piece is to open the eyes of home coffee drinkers in a few categories: 1. An understanding of what happens in the cup when a bean is processed differently. 2. The importance behind the age of a coffee. 3. Cupping in the home and in the roastery. ### Claims Anyone reading whom adamantly follows the coffee-based newsgroups, such as alt.coffee and rec.food.drink.coffee may be familiar with the running threads involving the Mexican coffee “Capulin.” As touted by its sales staff of one, the Capulin coffee is a naturally processed (dry-processed as I will discuss below) and manually harvested bean. Because of its method of processing and the care given to its harvesting, Capulin claims that it is perhaps the best coffee one will ever taste. It’s a claim that is difficult to live up to in this day and age of gourmet-this and specialty-that. As you’ll discover in this article, my preference is now for dry-processed coffee. Dry-processed coffees are harvested when ripe and then left to dry with the fruit still intact. Many claim that this contributes to the sweetness and fruitiness of the bean and increases the body. When dry, the fruit is removed through a shelling process; then the beans are inspected and graded. Washed or water-processed coffees are soaked when harvested, and the fruit is left to ferment. The beans are then dumped and rinsed. What happens after these two processes is not relevant to this article. ### Testing It’s in my nature to look at both sides of the coin. The Capulin representative was more than generous and willing to provide a sample from last year’s crop of the Capulin coffee. The sample, unroasted, was to be pitted against an earlier crop of the same as well as a new crop of a washed Mexican coffee bean. The purpose of the comparison was not only to find the character traits of each but also to show the differences between similar species of coffee. Additionally, I was comparing two dry-processed coffees to a washed coffee. I set up a cupping per SCAA (Specialty Coffee Association of America) standards. Following one guide, I set up the cupper’s table mid-morning, away from distractions. I measured 7.25 grams of each bean. The beans were roasted just into the second crack (finishing at an Agtron of 45/50) and ground to a medium grind. I then added the beans to 6 fluid ounces of water at approximately 195F.![coffee cupping](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/coffee-cupping1.CVOFLjVc_2wkLFe.webp)_Preparing for a coffee cupping._### Results Simply put, the results of my cupping weren’t startling, but they are informative. The oldest of the crops had a wet-cardboard fragrance and aroma, something I attributed to a defect of the bean. The oldest beans lacked any pleasurable taste/flavor and aftertaste, had a moderate body, and had low acidity. All in all, it was not an entirely great-tasting cup of coffee. I had higher expectations for the newer crop. However, the new crop also fell short in the taste category but had a more “fresh” acidity and medium body. It was, to me, about as average a Mexican coffee or any other Central-American coffee as one might find. The surprise came with the last cup — The washed Mexican Coatepec. In the nose, the Coatepec had a distinctively strong and sweet wine fragrance attributed to fruits. In the cup, it had a much more pronounced flavor and a delicate and pleasurable aftertaste. It, like the newer crop of Capulin, had a medium-medium high acidity and a balanced body. ### Why Cup? The results of this experiment should not constitute a general rule for all Mexican coffees, regardless of the process. So why bother? Because as a coffee consumer, I need to know for myself what I am drinking. Any information I can add to a bean’s portfolio will aid in my education towards coffee in general but will also help me discern my tastes for future coffee purchases. In other words, this cupping helped me discern what taste characteristics I prefer. It also helped me refine my senses for future coffee cupping sessions. ### More Cuppings (Experiments) Necessary But what does this tell us about the coffees in particular? Again, this does not tell us much on a wide scale. Does this totally destroy the claims of Capulin? Not necessarily. A larger sampling would need to be cupped against itself and the standards set up by the coffee’s producers. The experiment opened my eyes to the differences in processing. Furthermore, I realized that the final truth rests in the original quality of the bean itself. I am confident that dry-processed coffees can have a greater degree of body. To prove this, I might expand a cupping experiment to include dry-processed Mexican beans from another region as well as newer crop samplings of Capulin; then pit those coffee beans against washed coffees from other regions. ### Age Matters And what of the age issue? Again, from this experiment alone, I can not declare “old” coffee as bad coffee. Take for example Monsooned Indian Malabar, which is deliberately left to sit and age before export. With many food products, the results of aging are diminished flavor and taste. In coffee, while this is the case to some degree. However, in some cases, the acidity, body, and some taste characteristics are diminished when the bean gets old. Whether or not diminished acidity and body constitute bad coffee is up to the consumer. ### The Roast My friend, a new small-shop roaster learned, by taste, the degree of complication associated with coffee. He prefers to roast his coffee West-Coast style: dark, carbony, and smoky. I challenged him to roast lighter and to note the advantages/disadvantages of a light roast. As it would happen, a customer came in looking for… what else? A lightly roasted Mexican coffee. And what did this roaster have on hand? He had a dry-processed Mexican coffee (of unknown origin). We brewed his traditionally roasted Mexican and compared it to the lighter roast. In the cup, the darker Mexican exhibited a high acidity, a low body, and no particular flavor that stood out. It was an average Mexican coffee. Lightly roasted, the bean (surprisingly) exhibited increased body, similar acidity, and a delicate nuttiness, which the whole table appreciated. The roaster was happy to see that the results were positive. I think his eyes have been opened. Thus, the experiment led to an increase in knowledge and experience. The experiment advanced the cause for quality. ### Conclusion I’ve shown you how large and complicated the equation of taste can be. Bean age, quality, processing, and roast all determine the final taste of the coffee. I feel it is important to begin experimentation on your own if you have not already. While it may take many tries before your palate and nose become more refined, you will soon see and taste the benefits. Thus, you will appreciate coffee more and more with each cup! ### Resources [Coffee Cupping: A Basic](https://ineedcoffee.com/coffee-cupping-a-basic-introduction/) [Introduction](https://ineedcoffee.com/coffee-cupping-a-basic-introduction/) – A guide to get started with Coffee Cupping.

# Dark Roast vs Light Roast [Roasting Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/roasting-coffee/)---by [Denver Wilkinson](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/denver-wilkinson/)![Dark Roast vs Light Roast](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/dark-roast-vs-light-roast/light-to-dark-roasts1.jpg) Consider the last time you bought a bag of coffee. Perhaps it’s wrong of me to assume, but would I be correct in guessing the coffee you purchased was a “dark roast”? By watching coffee commercials and reading the ads, without hesitation, one would easily believe the dark roast is a superior coffee. When it comes to the roast of your coffee, while a great deal of it simply has to do with personal taste, don’t believe mass marketing that says the dark roast is the ultimate expression of quality coffee. It’s not. There are reasons the dark roast has become so popular. For one thing, the coffee industry is extremely large, the second largest industry next to oil. Think of the massive volume of coffee that hits the consuming market each year. Then consider this: only 10 percent of that coffee qualifies as excellent in quality. The remaining 90 percent is considered somewhere between average to poor. Meaning there’s nothing very special about it, no inherent flavors that set it apart from any other coffee. And if there are intriguing flavors, most likely they aren’t desirable. For instance, a typical low-grown Robusta coffee can taste medicinal, even rubbery. So, if so much of the coffee grown is of mediocre quality, why is it that people so happily consume so much each and every day? The answer: The Ubiquitous Dark Roast. (Well, and a lot of cream and sugar too. I’ll cover that some other time.)![Light to Dark Roast Progression](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/light-to-dark-roasts1.p7RrBnS1_Z8RHfG.webp)_Light to Dark Roast Progression_ Dark roast simply means that the coffee bean has been roasted to a higher temperature and typically for a longer period of time. This causes all of the flavor molecules stored within the coffee beans-both the good and bad flavors-to be burnt away. By roasting so dark, the end consumer (you) can’t tell whether it’s a good bean or a bad bean because all the natural flavors have been turned to charcoal. Think of it this way: a fine filet mignon and a strip of utility beef; if they’ve both been very overcooked, even a culinary expert would never be able to tell the difference between the two. Same with coffee. So if you’re a large coffee company, what do you do? You roast dark, then market the heck out of it and try to convince the mass market that it’s a wonderfully rich and complex coffee. You can’t really blame them now, can you? What else are they supposed to do, tell you that because they’re so big they are unable to guarantee the quality, they do you a favor and roast dark so you can’t taste how bad it is? Not to be misunderstood, I’m not saying a dark roasted coffee is always a poor coffee. There are some wonderful dark roasted single-origin coffees and blends out there. Just don’t assume the dark roast is as “rich and flavorful” as many roasters say it is. Most of the time there is a reason it’s roasted so darkly. Instead of going with a dark roast next time you’re picking up your bag of coffee, consider trying a freshly-roasted bag of something slightly lighter, perhaps a city roast or even a full city roast (almost a dark roast) if you’re not feeling terribly adventurous. When shopping, keep in mind that the lighter the roast, the more confidence the roaster is showing in the quality of the raw bean. There’s a whole world of coffee out there (quite literally) and so many natural flavors to experience, don’t settle for the mediocre stuff. The darker the roast, the less likely you’ll experience the subtle apricot flavors in a great Ethiopian Yirgacheffe, or the blueberry notes in a wonderful Harrar, or the earthy, ripened notes of a great Sumatran Mandheling.

# Daily Coffee Drinker? 3 Ways to “Green” Your Routine [Coffee Business](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/coffee-business/)---by [Drew Beal](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/drew-beal/)![Daily Coffee Drinker? 3 Ways to “Green” Your Routine](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/daily-coffee-drinker-3-ways-to-green-your-routine/earthday-kill-the-cup.jpg) Did you have a cup of coffee yesterday? If you’re an American over the age of 18, then the answer is probably ‘yes.’ That’s because 54% of adults drink coffee every day in this country [1]. This is completely understandable: it’s delicious, it wakes us up, and we’re totally addicted. Here’s another question: did you use a paper cup yesterday? If you visited a coffee shop, then the answer is overwhelmingly a probable ‘yes.’ That’s because 98% of drinks served at coffee shops are served in single-use disposable cups. Full disclosure: that’s the percentage of drinks that Starbucks serves in disposable cups. Sure, your local coffee shop might have a higher reusable rate (percentage of drinks served in reusable cups) than Starbucks (1.8%), but in my experience as Chief Environmental Optimist of Kill the Cup, rarely do I find a café that eclipses the 5% mark. Let’s review the numbers again: More than half of people drink coffee daily, and fewer than 1 in 50 carry a reusable cup. That’s pretty depressing. In total, **158 million paper cups are used every single day**. That seems pretty inefficient. With coffee consumption expected to increase by 25% over the next five years, it is imperative that we reduce our reliance on single-use disposables [3]. That’s what we’re working on at Kill the Cup.![earthday-kill-the-cup](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/earthday-kill-the-cup.Yppgg8YK_Z9bvrm.webp) Our goal is to develop a network of cafés and coffee drinkers who support the reusable movement. We want to reduce waste from paper cups, engage coffee drinkers in a fun way, and improve the performance of participating coffee shops. To raise awareness amongst coffee drinkers this Earth Day, we are challenging 22,000 people to take the Earth Day Pledge to carry a reusable cup on April 22. Participants can sign the pledge by visiting KillTheCup and entering their email address. Reminders will be sent out in the days leading up to Earth Day, April 22. And without further ado, here are three ways you can “Kill the Cup” this Earth Day (and every day…) ### #1 Bring a Reusable Cup This one is obvious. Join Kill the Cup Nation and take the Earth Day Pledge to carry a reusable on April 22. As an added benefit, many shops will give you a price discount for bringing your own cup. Hold your head high as you walk around with your personal mug. If you see a fellow coffee drinker with a reusable cup, raise it as a sign of respect. You’re saving the world one cup at a time. ### #2 Brew Your Own Coffee I’ve been focusing on coffee shops, but many of us drink coffee at home. If you do, reduce your carbon footprint by making your own coffee. Single-serve pods hurt the environment. In 2013, Green Mountain produced 8.3 billion K-Cups, enough to wrap around the equator 10.5 times. If you still want to brew with your Keurig there are now reusable K-Cup options such as the Ekobrew. The same goes for people who drink coffee at the office. Take one for the team and brew a pot for your colleagues. And then tell the boss he owes you lunch. ### #3 Support Your Local Coffee Shop Independent coffee roasters are doing some pretty amazing things — support your local economy by visiting a new coffee shop this Earth Day. If you’re already a regular at your neighborhood spot, invite a friend or colleague to join you. It’s likely that your local shop purchases products from close to home, so you’ll also be cutting down on the fossil fuel required to bring you your daily cup o’ joe. ### Resources KillTheCup – Seeking 22,000 people to carry a reusable on April 22.

# Designing a Website for a Coffee House [Coffee Business](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/coffee-business/)---by [Michael Allen Smith](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/michael-allen-smith/)![Designing a Website for a Coffee House](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/designing-a-web-site-for-a-coffee-house/coffeehouse-outdoor-board1.jpg) Creating a web page is an inexpensive and effective way for a cafe to promote itself. People looking to find a new coffeehouse in the neighborhood or while traveling will often start researching on the Internet. However, what should be a straightforward way to promote a business frequently turns ugly. The vast majority of websites devoted to local coffeehouses are failures. They lack information and design and are rarely maintained. This article discusses what elements should go into designing a website for cafes. ### Information Checklist – The Basics 90% of the battle is being able to describe a cafe from a website completely. What information belongs on a cafe website? There are many examples of cafes that try to be cool before being functional. Get the following basics down before you get fancy: - **Location** – Provide an address, phone number, and map for each location. - **Hours** – Post the hours of operation for each day of the week. If you are closed on Sunday, let the web surfers know before they drive across town to try your espresso. - **Pictures** – A picture is worth a thousand words. Take photos of the outside, the inside, and even the staff. Invite users into your cafe from the comfort of their browsers. - **Menu** – This is very important. EVERY coffeehouse website should include a full drink and food menu. With a website, you can do things that aren’t possible with a chalkboard menu inside the cafe. Describe the drinks. Take a photo of each of the desserts. In my opinion, you should also list the prices. - **About the business** – Tell the readers what makes the cafe unique. Do you have a one-page history that you can share? - **Press** – If your cafe is any good then at some point it has been mentioned or reviewed in the local newspapers. Share those reprints on the website. Tell the user about any awards the cafe has won.![coffeehouse sidewalk board](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/coffeehouse-outdoor-board1.CsiK7HkL_ZQxJdT.webp)_This sidewalk board shows hours, wifi status, and the roaster and highlights a menu item. Are these data points on the website?_### Additional Ideas Once you’ve tackled the basics on the website, include some more elaborate features. The following are but a few ideas: - **Promotional Items** – Offer coupons on the website as a way to bring in the casual surfer. Last week, I visited a Las Vegas microbrewery because they offered a “free beer” coupon on their website. - **Employment Opportunities** – Is your cafe hiring? Devote a page to open positions with job descriptions and qualifications. Don’t forget to post the URL in the cafe. Maybe one of your customers is seeking a part-time position. - **Webcam** – Let the surfer peek into the cafe in real-time. This should only be done if there is a commitment to maintaining a live connection and the staff is trained on how to work the webcam. - **Staff Extranet** – Develop a secured extranet to enable employees to log in from home to check schedules, access training manuals, and do issue tracking. Is there a procedure checklist that needs to be shared? Allow employees to make vacation requests and trade hours from a secured website. ### Design – Colors and Fonts Ideally, you should create a website that looks as visually stimulating as the cafe itself. Starbucks matches the same colors and fonts on its website as it does in its cafe. That isn’t by accident. If your coffeehouse is brick, then don’t use purple as the website’s background color. Paying for a top-notch professional specializing in graphics for the Internet isn’t always an option for many small businesses. Too many novices make cluttered websites with background images, loud colors, and obnoxious music. Many cafe owners will spend thousands of dollars furnishing and designing the interior of the coffeehouse and then spend nothing to capture the look and feel of that cafe on the website. A beautiful cafe should never be reduced to a FrontPage template. To those trying to do graphics themselves, I advise keeping it simple. Use 2-3 colors, a consistent font, and easy navigation. ### Maintainability As with any website that holds data, there must be a commitment to maintaining the site. Did you discontinue a line of desserts? Are you opening an hour later on Saturday? Are you closed on a national holiday? The website needs to reflect these changes accurately. From a June 2000 review of Xando cafe: > Is the site being updated? Last night I walked by the Xando in the Old Town section of Alexandria, VA that isn’t listed on the site. As new Xando locations open, the web site should be updated. Four months later, that information still hasn’t been updated. Anybody planning a trip to the DC Metropolitan area looking for a coffeehouse near Arlington Cemetery will blindly stumble into Starbucks because they won’t know about this local gem. Meanwhile, Starbucks meticulously maintains its website. ### Summary Creating a functional website for a coffeehouse is not very complex. Sites can stand out from the crowd by merely providing users with basic information surrounded by a simple, consistent design.

# Different Coffeehouse Archetypes [Cafe Culture](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/cafe-culture/)---by [Jym Annear](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/jym-annear/)![Different Coffeehouse Archetypes](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/different-coffeehouse-archetypes/coffee-shop-menu1.jpg) I’ve been a barista for about four years now. I’ve worked in quite different areas of the country, for quite different coffeehouses. But people are people, and I’ve noticed they invariably fall into one of several different archetypes. Fellow baristas will recognize them; fellow coffee patrons should beware them.**The Wanderer**: Walks in the door. Walks to the bar. Orders nothing. Walks to the condiment stand. Walks to the bathroom. Walks to the newsstand. Walks out.**The Pretentious Git**: Orders a ‘macchiato’. Has no clue what it actually is.**The Ultra-Pretentious Git**: Orders a ‘macchiato’. Knows what it is.**The Epicurean**: “I want a skinny-double-half-cup-latte with extra foam. Cinnamon on top. Cardamom, not plain.”**Apparently Your Best Friend**: “Dude, can I borrow your phone, use your bathroom, take this paper with me, bum a cigarette, and oh, I just want water.”**The Legally Blind**: “Where’s your menu?” You point to the huge menu directly behind you. “Do you have espresso?” You point to the huge $14,000 espresso machine next to you. “Where are your prices?” etc., etc.,….![Coffee Shop Menu](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/coffee-shop-menu1.CJedV_tM_wSYh0.webp)_Where’s your menu?_**The Smart-Aleck We Can All Do Without**: “Do you guys sell coffee here? Huh huh.”**The Purist**: Orders triple espressos. Drinks them like Evian. Usually has groupies. Competes with others in drinking espressos like they were at a frat party.**The Moron Purist**: Orders a triple espresso decaf.**The Trendy Cynic**: Comes in, orders one cup of plain coffee, sits by the door for the rest of the day, sneering at whoever comes in.**The Trendy Moron About to Get Beaten With a Bat**: Comes in regularly, and asks for something with coffee in it that doesn’t taste like coffee. When coffeehouses became the new fad, these idiots came out in droves. Blame “Friends”.**It’s Always ShowTime**: Always comes in with a musical instrument (guitar, bongo drums). Plays regardless of being asked, regardless of being asked to stop. Acts hurt when you ask him to play elsewhere.**The Requisite Nutbar**: Asks for hot water, claiming he has a tea bag he bought elsewhere. Sits in the corner talking to himself and staring at the wall. Tries to argue with imaginary friend in opposite chair, gets angry at imaginary friend’s silence. Asks you to mediate dispute between them.**Wasting Her Time**: Seems to think coffee’s the Diet Drink of Tomorrow: “I want a decaf latte with skim milk, a shot of sugar-free vanilla, nondairy whipped cream on top and could you point me to the powdered creamer?”**Wasting My Time**: “Gimme a double-espresso. No, make that a vanilla capp. No, I actually want a hazelnut mocha. No, I meant to say almond. Ah, screw it, just gimme coffee.”**Coffee Nazis**: Complains that your coffee wasn’t organically grown. Complains your Tanzanian Peaberry isn’t acidic enough, your Sumatra too acidic. Complains if the coffee wasn’t brewed less than five minutes ago, demands a fresh pot. Complains the Colombian doesn’t taste as good as the place down the street. Complains about the prices. Complains that you’ve been using Folgers to deceive customers and save money, etc.**The Undead**: Those whose introduction to coffee was Starbucks. Obviously undemanding, fairly easy to please, but cannot comprehend that the REAL world doesn’t use nondairy creamer and *doesn’t* call a small coffee “tall”.

# The Double Bourbon Iced Coffee Recipe [Recipes](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/coffee-recipes/)---by [Steven Parrott](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/steven-parrott/)![The Double Bourbon Iced Coffee Recipe](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/double-bourbon-iced-coffee-recipe/double-bourbon-iced-coffee-recipe.jpg) Alcoholic drinks with coffee are a kind of an oxymoron of sorts. At first, your heart starts pumping, and you feel fresh with energy, ready for the day or the moment ahead, but there is a calm need to relax almost immediately. Your body says, take a seat buddy, put your legs up, and enjoy another sip. The Double Bourbon Iced Coffee is no different in those regards. This drink combines three of my favorite things: cold brew, stout beer, and bourbon. It’s the perfect combination of sweet coffee and bourbon with the slight bitterness of the stout. Best of all, nobody will know you have this brunch trick up your sleeve for those who prefer coffee to a bloody mary or a mimosa.![Double Bourbon Cold Brew Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/double-bourbon-setup-and-final.DXSh23KQ_1hunIc.webp) Ice cold and creamy with that smooth bourbon undertone, this drink will have you yearning for more. So go ahead, double the recipe while you’re at it, and share with some friends or family. ### Ingredients - 2 oz. strong cold-brew coffee - 2 oz. stout beer (I used Anderson Valley’s Bourbon Barrel Stout) - 1½ oz.

# Double Shot 3.0 – A Portable French Press with Secret Storage [Brewing Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/brewing-coffee/)---by [Michael Allen Smith](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/michael-allen-smith/)![Double Shot 3.0 – A Portable French Press with Secret Storage](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/double-shot-3-0-a-portable-french-press-with-secret-storage/double-shot-french-press-ravel.jpg) I recently received a Double Shot 3.0 French Press from Planetary Design. This updated portable French Press uses the same Bru Stop technology they added to their Tabletop French Press line, which we covered in the article  [French Press Tabletop Coffee and Tea Maker with Bru Stop Technology Review](https://ineedcoffee.com/table-top-press-pot-review/). For over a decade, I made French Press coffee about three times daily. It was an earlier time when the filters did a poor job of keeping the coffee grounds separate from the coffee once the brewing period was complete. Because of this, immediately after brewing, I would always transfer all the coffee brewed directly into a mug or some form of thermal container. It was an extra step, but if I didn’t take that step, the coffee that remained in the French Press would continue brewing at a slow rate. The coffee would become over-extracted and undrinkable.![Double Shot French Press](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/double-shot-french-press.DZi2qEx__ZdBDud.webp)_Double Shot 3.0 French Press Travel Mug_### Bru Stop Filter With traditional filters, it is easy to over-extract French Press coffee if you leave it in the brewer for too long. The Bru Stop filter solved that problem. It is a tighter filter that does a superior job of trapping the ground coffee at the end of the brew cycle. As bad as the over-extraction problem was with counter-top French Press brewers, there was a worse problem with travel French Presses. Coffee grounds easily escaped from the bottom into your brew. How often do French press drinkers using travel models sip coffee with loose coffee grounds? Too many. The good news is the Double Shot 3.0 uses the same Bru Stop filter, so the risk of loose grounds has been greatly reduced. Although I didn’t experience any loose grounds, I hesitate to say the potential has been eliminated, because travel mugs by their very nature get bumped around more than a counter-top French Press. Just do your best job avoiding potholes on your commute and you should be fine.![Bru Stop Filter - French Press Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/double-shot-bru-stop.L-8lk55j_Z27vBJm.webp)_The Bru Stop filter for the Double Shot 3.0._  ### Secret Storage When I first looked into the Double Shot, it seemed rather shallow compared to what I was holding. That is when I figured out the base is detachable. When you screw off the base, you have a secret storage container, which is perfect for storing more coffee. Brilliant! Back in the day, I used to bring a French Press and a Tupperware container with additional coffee into the office. If I didn’t grab the Tupperware, I wouldn’t get afternoon coffee. With the Double Shot, you add the extra coffee into the base while making the first French Press.![Double Shot French Press Storage](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/doubel-shot-coffee-storage.Br5rWDsC_Z18YuIl.webp)_The secret storage for the Double Shot 3.0._### Holds Heat and Doesn’t Spill A travel French Press or any travel mug must excel at holding heat, especially for those living in cold areas—campers and hikers. The Double Shot 3.0, like the Tabletop model, uses a stainless steel interior and vacuum insulation to keep the beverage warm. The lid is solid as well. I had no spillage or leaks during my tests. ### Overview If you want a travel French Press, the Double Shot 3.0 by Planetary Design is an excellent choice. It will hold the heat, keep the loose grounds out of your brew, and even provide a way to carry extra coffee for your next brew. This is also a perfect travel mug for loose-leaf tea drinkers, especially those who use teas that can withstand multiple steeps. ### Resources [French Press Tabletop Coffee and Tea Maker with Bru Stop Technology Review](https://ineedcoffee.com/table-top-press-pot-review/) – Overview of their countertop model.

These rum balls are especially good because they are easy to assemble and they are less intoxicating than other recipes. This recipe makes about 45 rum balls.![Espresso rum balls](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/n-rum-tray.B5qgKlsF_1khDSV.webp)_Espresso rum balls on the tray._### Ingredients – For the Rum Balls - 3 cups of vanilla wafers, chopped (about one package) - 1/2 cup of chopped nuts (walnuts, or pecans) - 1/3 cup of light or dark rum - 2 shots of espresso - 3 tablespoons of honey - 1 1/2 tablespoons of cocoa powder ### Ingredients – For the Coating - 3 plastic Ziploc bags – sandwich size, or something similar. ### Ingredients – First Bag - 3/4 cup of powdered sugar ### Ingredients – Second Bag - 3/4 cup of powdered sugar - 1 tablespoon of cocoa powder ### Ingredients – Third Bag - 3/4 cup of chopped nuts ### Directions Put the vanilla wafers in a food processor. Make sure that they are finely chopped, if there are large pieces, you will end up with lumpy rum balls. Put the walnuts in the food processor. Chop these to a fine chop also. Make sure to separate some of the walnuts for the coating.![Put walnuts into the food processor.](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/n-processor.tLHGXq8s_Z2nA6Ys.webp)_Put walnuts into the food processor._ Combine the chopped wafers, chopped walnuts, espresso, rum, honey, and cocoa powder into a large bowl.

Place a small amount of the batter in your palm and roll it into a ball shape. These rum balls are very rich, so make sure that you make the balls very small. Place a ball into one of the three Ziploc bags that you have prepared for the coating. Zip the bag shut and shake the bag so that the rum ball is thoroughly coated. Remove the rum ball and set it aside.![Rum ball gift box](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/n-gift-single.CAVCvw0z_Jwinj.webp)_Rum ball gift box_![Multiple rum ball gift boxes](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/n-gift.ChHb_0pA_1Qisa6.webp)_Multiple rum ball gift boxes_### Tips Place the coated rum balls on an ungreased cookie sheet covered with wax paper. Let the rum balls breathe for at least an hour before attempting to store/package them. They will mellow over the next few days. They do not need to be refrigerated, but they must be stored in an airtight container. If refrigerated, the coating may need to be reapplied.

# Does Coffee Raise Blood Pressure? [Coffee and Health](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/coffee-health/)---by [Matt Pitcher](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/matt-pitcher/)_Matt Pitcher is a Certified Fitness Trainer (CFT)_ If you suffer from Cardiovascular Disease (CVD or coronary heart disease) and/or fear you might someday due to high blood pressure, is your coffee consumption compounding the problem? Or, are there other things you can do to alleviate your high blood pressure and CVD concerns that do NOT include ending, or severely lessening, your coffee intake? This article explores reliable answers to those questions. ### Can Coffee Contribute to Coronary Heart Disease? CVD is the number one cause of death in America, and high blood pressure is one of its biggest red flags. CVD has been the subject of extensive medical and scientific research for several decades. While researchers have differed in their conclusions over time, new evidence reported in The American Journal of Epidemiology in 1999 strongly indicates that consumption of coffee and caffeine does not contribute to CVD, finding neither caffeinated nor decaffeinated coffee associated with the risk of stroke, even for those drinking more than four cups of coffee a day. Warren G. Thompson, M.D., noted in a 1994 literature review published in The American Journal of Medical Sciences, that: “The largest and better studies suggest that coffee is not a major risk factor for coronary disease.” Willet et. al, in a prospective study reported in the February 1996 issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA), examined data collected from more than 85,000 women over a 10-year period. After adjusting for known risk factors, the authors found no evidence for any positive association between coffee consumption and risk of CVD for women consuming six or more cups of coffee a day. A 1990 New England Journal of Medicine study of more than 45,000 men found no link between coffee, caffeine, and CVD for those drinking four or more cups of coffee a day. These results confirm findings from the earlier Framingham Heart Study of more than 6,000 adults conducted over 20 years (as published in the Archives of Internal Medicine) and two 1987 studies using data from the Honolulu Heart Program (published in The New England Journal of Medicine and The American Journal of Epidemiology respectively). ### Does Coffee/Caffeine Consumption Contribute to High Blood Pressure? Despite the previous controversy on the subject, most researchers now conclude that regular coffee and caffeine use has little or no effect on blood pressure. Studies reviewed in Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases indicate that while first-time caffeine use may produce immediate, minimal changes in blood pressure, these changes are transient. No changes in blood pressure appear to occur in regular users of caffeine. A 1991 study published in the British Medical Journal reached the same conclusion and indicated that restricting caffeine did not reduce blood pressure in people with mild hypertension. A number of studies that have looked at people with normal blood pressure (published in the Archives of Internal Medicine and the American Journal of Nutrition) have concluded that caffeine does not contribute to hypertension. In 1997, the Sixth Report of the National Institutes of Health’s Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation and Treatment of High Blood Pressure concluded that “no direct relationship between caffeine intake and elevated blood pressure has been found in most epidemiologic surveys.” I think it’s safe to conclude that enough reliable evidence exists that can put to rest the claim that coffee/caffeine contributes to high blood pressure and even CVD.![blood pressure](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/blood-pressure.DSpBhym-_Z1xssUV.webp) ### What’s the Better Alternative to Retiring Your Coffee Mug? As a certified fitness trainer, I’ve learned that one of the most effective ways to counteract high blood pressure and the onset of CVD is to be physically active, NOT – as the studies above prove – eliminate caffeine consumption. In fact, as my [caffeine and fitness article](https://ineedcoffee.com/coffee-and-fitness-friends-or-foes/) explains, caffeine can even help you become more fit. An American Heart Association study, as referenced by several peer-reviewed scientific and medical publications, has recently claimed that people who are physically active have a lower risk of getting high blood pressure — 20%-50% lower — than people who are not active. Besides losing weight, there are other reasons to exercise: Being physically active can reduce your risk for heart disease, help lower your total cholesterol level and raise HDL-cholesterol (the “good” cholesterol that does not build up in the arteries), and help lower high blood pressure. And, again, people who are physically active have a lower risk of getting high blood pressure — 20 to 50 percent lower — than people who are not active. More vigorous exercise has added benefits. It helps improve the fitness of the heart and lungs. And that, in turn, protects you more against heart disease and high blood pressure. Activities like swimming, brisk walking, running, and jumping rope are called “aerobic.” This means that the body uses oxygen to make the energy it needs for the activity. Aerobic activities can condition your heart and lungs if done at the right intensity for 30 minutes, three to four times a week. But if you don’t have 30 minutes for a break, try to find two 15-minute periods or even three 10-minute periods. Try to do some type of aerobic activity in the course of a week. Since stress is also a major cause of high blood pressure, exercise can help lower stress levels as well. Most people don’t need to see a doctor before they start exercising since a gradual, sensible exercise program has few health risks. But if you have a health problem like high blood pressure; if you have pains or pressure in the chest or shoulder area; if you tend to feel dizzy or faint; if you get very breathless after a mild workout; or are middle-aged or older and have not been active, and you are planning a vigorous exercise program, you should check with your doctor first. Otherwise, drink your coffee, get out, get active, and get fit — and help prevent high blood pressure and CVD. ### Conclusion Coffee consumption does not contribute to high blood pressure and CVD. Retiring your coffee mug is not going to help you reduce your risks. Exercising, however, will. So, go ahead and drink your coffee – especially before your next workout! ### Resources [Blood Pressure and Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/blood-pressure-and-coffee/) – A contrary view on coffee’s role on blood pressure._Photo by [RawPixel](https://unsplash.com/@rawpixel)_ Published on February 1, 2009--- #### Matt Pitcher Matt Pitcher is a certified fitness trainer and entrepreneur.

Duck Breasts, cleaned and fat removed, scored #### Liquid Marinade: - 12 oz darker roasted coffee - 8 oz dark rum - 6 oz spiced rum - 1 handful of Herbs, Parsley, Thyme, what you have on hand #### Dry Rub: - 1 1/2 teaspoons Cinnamon, ground - 3/4 teaspoon Nutmeg, freshly ground - 2 oz finely ground coffee (see [espresso grind photo](https://ineedcoffee.com/coffee-grind-chart/)) - 2 tablespoons Unsalted Butter - 2 cups Wild Rice Pilaf, cooked to serve #### Sauce: - 6 oz darker roasted coffee - 3 oz dark rum - 1 teaspoon Cinnamon, ground - 1/2 teaspoon Nutmeg ### Directions 1. Brew 12 ounces of coffee; set aside. Mix 6 ounces brewed coffee, 3 ounces dark rum and 3 ounces spiced rum in a re-sealable plastic bag. 2. Combine Rub ingredients in a medium mixing bowl. With a sharp knife, score the duck breast skin. Place into the marinade. MARINATE for 8-12 hours. 3. Once the duck has marinated; remove it from the marinade discarding the liquid. Roll breasts in the rub mixture and then place skin side up in the roasting pan and cover with a lid. Roast at 175℉ for one hour. After one (1) hour, remove the roasting pan from the oven and let the duck rest; covered. 4. Combine all sauce ingredients in a medium saucepan, bring to a boil, and then turn the heat to a simmer. Reduce the sauce by half, stirring often. 5. Remove breasts from the roasting pan. Strain drippings from the roasting pan through a sieve into your sauce ingredients pan. Reduce the sauce with drippings by half, stirring often. 6. In a large saute pan, add butter, and once it is melted (and the pan is hot, but the butter is not burning), add the duck breasts – skin side down. Sauté breasts for 1 minute on each side. ### ![Duck Marinade Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/duck-breast-coffee.DGot4PeI_Z1sPSVS.webp) ### (option 1) Flambé and Sauté Add two (2) ounces of dark rum and flambe (Optional). Remove breasts from saute pan and place on a bed of Wild Rice Pilaf. Drizzle sauce mixture over each breast just before serving with fresh steamed asparagus or a vegetable medley. ### (option 2) Grill Prepare the grill for direct and indirect cooking/medium heat (350°F-450°F), grill the duck breasts, skin side down first, over direct medium heat, with the lid closed, until the skin is browned and the meat is cooked to your desired doneness, 8-10 minutes for medium-rare, turning once (if flare-ups occur, move the breasts temporarily over indirect heat). Be careful not to overcook the breast. Remove from the grill and let the duck rest. Or for clearer doneness, grill the duck for 5-7 minutes or until a meat thermometer registers 145°F-150°F. for medium doneness. Serve as desired. Published on November 10, 2010--- #### J.B.

# Don’t Hate Me Because I’m Decaffeinated [Coffee and Health](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/coffee-health/)---by [Laura K Baker](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/laura-k-baker/)![Don’t Hate Me Because I’m Decaffeinated](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/dont-hate-me-because-im-decaffeinated/decaf-coffee-comic1.jpg) I recently moved to Charlottesville, Virginia. With all the packing and unpacking, and finding my way around, there’s been very little time for writing. Or sleeping. Frankly, I’m exhausted. As such, I almost switched to regular coffee. Almost. So close. I was right there. For one, I continue to carry the anticipatory self-loathing before ordering decaf at the numerous coffee shops in town (which are plentiful and surprising, more on these to come). And, as I said, I’m just tired. I could use a jolt. _What’s the point of decaf in my life, anyway?_, I’ve been wondering. No point at all. And then last week, I was innocently flipping through a magazine at the doctor’s office when I read an article saying that if you want beautiful skin (I do!), you should lay off the caffeine. Ah-ha! It’s starting to fit together. Ever since I had my daughter, who is now 4, people have commented on how nice my skin looks. Lest you think I’m being arrogant, I can’t actually tell what these people mean. To me, my skin looks the way it always looked. And I didn’t use to hear such comments.![decaf coffee comic](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/decaf-coffee-comic1.Cwhp9Szr_1RGtyj.webp)_Problem? Decaf by [Todd Zapoli](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/todd-zapoli/)_ But I get them a lot now; one person even told me my skin looks airbrushed. Again, lest you hate me, be assured that I have many other problems. For instance, no one walks up to me with a sandwich and says, “It looks like you are wasting away, my dear. Eat this.” Until recently, I had always assumed the skin thing had to do with pregnancy. You know, some women find their hair curls after having a baby, where it used to stick straight? Or do other women’s feet grow? (Mine did, not a real plus, in my book.) But the skin thing: I’m starting to think it’s not the hormones; it’s the decaf. The medical studies on coffee and caffeine are mixed, as always. While caffeine has become a regular ingredient in eye creams and anti-cellulite potions because of its diuretic (read: anti-puffiness) effects, that same element seems to give some coffee-lovers bad skin. Full-caf coffee has been linked to frequent break-outs or generally dry skin. I have dry skin already, so these studies seem plausible to me. Perhaps avoiding my few cups of full-octane coffee evens out my complexion. Now, many of you coffee heroes and heroines may be balking at these claims. In fact, I may join you one of these sleepy mornings. Coffee, as we know, has many measurable and immeasurable rewards, including beneficial antioxidants. And in the end, when you want your coffee, you want your coffee. But since I’m already on the fake stuff, and I keep getting these nice compliments, I think I’m going to stick with decaf just a little while longer. And now, if you’ll excuse me, I have to finish my cup of decaf and put my apparently clear skin to bed. I’m beat.

# An Easy Guide to Making Cold Brew Coffee [Brewing Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/brewing-coffee/)---by [Michael Allen Smith](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/michael-allen-smith/)![An Easy Guide to Making Cold Brew Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/easy-guide-making-cold-brew-coffee/easy-guide-cold-brew-coffee.jpg) In an earlier article titled [Cold Brew Coffee is Not Rocket Science](https://ineedcoffee.com/cold-brew-coffee-is-not-rocket-science/), I outlined just how easy it was to make cold brew coffee at home. No matter how you tackle the task of making cold brew, it all breaks down to some basic steps: 1. Grind coffee to a medium-coarse or regular coarse setting. 2. Place coffee inside a filter. 3. Put that filter in cold water. 4. Wait 12-24 hours. 5. Remove the filter and serve. There is one remaining step: cleaning everything up so your cold brewer is ready to go the next time you brew coffee. Some of the more basic methods require a little more time for cleanup. In this tutorial, I’ll show you how to make cold brew coffee using the Cold Brew Coffee Maker from Home and Above. Not only is it easy to use, but it is also super easy to clean up.![](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/coldcoffee-brewer.Bm95Dm2z_1l0X2E.webp) *Cold Brew Coffee Maker – Iced Coffee Glass Pitcher 32oz with Sealing Removable Filter *### Why I Like the Cold Brew Coffee Maker The first step in using a new coffee brewer is the math. How much coffee do I use? Is that in grams? Where is my scale? Now, how much water do I need? The Cold Brew Coffee Maker is very simple. It is as if they anticipated these questions when they designed the brewer. Along the side of the brewer, there are markings for 8 oz, 16 oz, 24 oz, and 32 oz. Pretty cool. Now, I don’t need to use a measuring cup to add water. **For this brewer, I advise only using the 32 oz mark.** At 24 oz, not all the coffee will be under the water line. But at 32 oz, the water line reaches exactly the level in the filter where the ground coffee reaches. Also, note that once you remove the filter, you won’t get 32 ounces of coffee. It will be closer to 24 ounces. The other thing I like about this brewer is its design. Not only does it functionally perform its task as a cold brewer, but it also looks nice on the counter. When the coffee is finished brewing, it has a nice handle that makes pouring easy. Let us make some cold brew coffee. ### #1 Grind 1 Cup of Coffee A common ratio in cold brew coffee is 4 to 1. This means four parts water for 1 part coffee. 32 ounces is 1 quart, or 4 cups in a quart. Divide by 4, and we get 1 cup of coffee. For those who prefer grams, use 85 grams of coffee. The coffee should be ground medium-coarse to coarse. See our [Coffee Grind Chart](https://ineedcoffee.com/coffee-grind-chart/) for more guidance, but don’t be concerned with being exact. Cold brew is very forgiving.![](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/coldbrew-coffee-setup.CpwdPemW_Z14oTDw.webp) ### #2  Place Filter in Brewer and Add Ground Coffee to Filter Place the metal filter inside the Cold Brew Coffee Maker. Then add 1 cup of ground coffee into the metal filter. Make sure to brush off any loose grounds on the top lip. Alternatively, you can use a funnel. If you have an AeroPress, you can use that funnel. It fits perfectly.![](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/add-coffee-coldcoffe.D2PMDcXO_BKR77.webp)![](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/coldcoffee-grounds-filter.DWj2Cb85_1dAT05.webp)![](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/use-filter-coldcoffee.COwim6ug_Z1JwjDD.webp)_If you have a funnel, use it. Otherwise, brush the loose grounds down into the filter._  ### #3 Add Cold Water Slowly pour cold water over the coffee grounds. Continue pouring water until the water reaches the 32-ounce line.![](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/add-water-coldcoffee.DYd3QvGY_2jNieU.webp) ### #4 Add Lid and Wait 12-24 Hours Place the lid on the brewer. At this point, all we need to do is let the brewing begin. Place the brewer out of the way somewhere for 12-24 hours. I brew on the counter at room temperature. There is an exposed opening at the top where you will pour later. If you are concerned about dust or fruit flies in the coffee, place a plastic bag or plastic wrap over the top of the brewer during the 12-24 hours while it is brewing.![](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/coldcoffee-brew-begins.CQRABLqH_Z1WXulu.webp) ### #5 Remove Filter and Serve Even though the lid should be firmly attached to the metal filter, I advise slowly removing it. Set the filter in the sink for now because a small amount of coffee will continue to drain out. Depending on your personal taste and how long you brewed the coffee, it might be too strong. If so, add water to taste. At this point, you can serve it over ice or place it in the refrigerator to chill. You can also heat it up in a microwave and drink your coffee hot. Even hot, your cold brew will retain a clean, low-acidity taste.![](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/coldbrew-end.CQKti0Zj_1NVLLI.webp) ### Clean Up Remove the lid and knock the grounds into a compost bin. Give the filter a quick rinse, or you can put it in the dishwasher. I wash mine by hand. Even though it is dishwasher safe, I don’t know how many cycles in the dishwasher could damage the rubber lip where the lid secures into the filter. ### Troubleshooting If the coffee tastes too strong, you can add water and, in the future, use either a shorter brewing time, less coffee, or coarser coffee grounds. If the coffee tastes too weak, you can use a longer brew time or a finer ground coffee. Adding more coffee likely wouldn’t help with this brewer since the additional coffee would be above the water line. ### Last Words I’m a big fan of the design of the _Cold Brew Coffee Maker from Home and Above_. The only issue is the exposed lip during the brewing, which is easily solved by covering it with an upside-down plastic bag. Don’t waste your money buying expensive cold brew coffee in the coffee shops. It is too easy to make it yourself. Cold Brew coffee is also ideal for people who are pressed for time in the morning. Time the brew so it is finished before you leave your house. Pour and go. ### Resources_Cold Brew Coffee Maker by Home and Above_[Cold Brew Coffee is Not Rocket Science](https://ineedcoffee.com/cold-brew-coffee-is-not-rocket-science/) – The basics of cold brew coffee.

# Economic Benefits of Home Roasting [Roasting Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/roasting-coffee/)---by [John Carrier](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/john-carrier/)![Economic Benefits of Home Roasting](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/economic-benefits-of-home-roasting/OneServCoffee1.jpg) ### Financial Benefits The economics of coffee consumption is quite relevant to the home roasting industry. There is a direct relationship between the quality – perceived or real – of coffee and the amount consumed (people will drink more coffee if it tastes better). Because of perceived quality increases, many consumers have increased their visits to specialty coffee retailers. (The following numbers used are generalizations, but should be pretty close to reality.) These retailers routinely charge $1.50 for a 12 oz. serving of coffee and $4.00 for an espresso-based drink. Some people will actually drive to the retailer and gladly pay those amounts – daily. This doesn’t even take into consideration the cost of gas, the value of time in transit to the retail location, or the time spent in line at the shop. Assuming five orders per week, that amounts to $7.50 for the coffee drinker and $20 for the espresso-drink consumer. Annual costs for pre-made drinks can begin to approach $400-$1,000. Some consumers realize the expenses they are incurring from purchasing coffee at retail outlets and move on to making the drinks in their homes. To have coffee close to the quality of specialty retailers, consumers will need to buy beans, and roasted specialty-grade coffee is about $12 per pound before any applicable shipping costs. The cost obviously comes down quite a bit relative to the retailer-made drinks. A pound of coffee is about 450 grams of which you can make approximately 20 servings of coffee (12 oz. each, using 14g of ground coffee for each 8 oz. of water) and 25 double-shots of espresso (using 18g of ground coffee per double). Assuming five servings a week as in the scenario with the retailer-made drinks, that amounts to only $12.00 a month for coffee drinkers and $10 a month for espresso drinkers. The annual difference is dramatic, reduced to about $90 a year for coffee and $120 for espresso. These consumption assumptions for homemade drinks are probably not all that realistic (way too low) but are only meant to make an appropriate comparison to the cost of retailer-made drinks.![Annual Cost of Coffee (Not Home Roasted) ](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/OneServCoffee1.D4ry1MSP_ZaBANg.webp)_Annual Cost of Coffee (Not Home Roasted) – 1 serving daily_![Annual Cost of Espresso-Based Drink (Not Home Roasted) ](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/OneServingEspresso.DrytUPU9_Z1Ft80w.webp)_Annual Cost of Espresso-Based Drink (Not Home Roasted) – 1 serving daily_ Here is a more likely situation. As consumers begin to realize that the quality of their coffee could be improved greatly just by increasing the freshness, they may be led to roast their own coffee. As the resulting cup quality increases through the greater level of freshness attained by home roasting, consumers will be more likely to use more coffee. People will also experiment more when home roasting, which can also increase usage. It would not be uncommon for home roasters to go through an average of 4 to 6 cups of coffee or 4 double shots of espresso per day. At that rate, one pound of coffee would only last a week. Purchasing roasted coffee would cost about $50 a month, or about $600 annually. Significant savings and benefits from higher quality will accrue to consumers that decide to home roast. Unroasted beans can generally be purchased for about $5 a pound, reducing monthly coffee costs to about $20, or about $240 annually. For some people, the opportunities of home roasting will significantly increase usage to the point where they may not be reducing the expense of purchasing coffee, particularly in the case of an avid espresso drinker.![Annual Costs ](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/FourServings.DwTv58dt_Z28c0RJ.webp)_Annual Costs – 4 servings per day_### Non-Financial Benefits Home roasting can take up a fair amount of time. There is some opportunity cost (the value you give up by choosing not to do something of benefit to you) in home roasting relative to purchasing roasted beans from a retailer that ships immediately after roasting. Roasts can take up to 30 minutes with set-up, cool-down, and wrap-up. For some people, this may be too great a commitment on the surface. People are overloaded and seem to have little room for anything new in their lives. However, people will always find time to do the things that are important to them. The economic benefits of home roasting are real, but perhaps the greater benefit is in the therapy that comes from the relaxing experience of home roasting (the lull of beans, the excitement of first/second crack, the wafting aroma, etc.) Home roasting is an enjoyable experience with benefits that go well beyond the resulting coffee._For an economic case study comparing a premium store-roasted coffee with a home-roasted one, read The 2 Best Cups of Coffee I’ve Ever Had._ Published on March 1, 2007--- #### John Carrier

# Making German Ice Cream Coffee (Eiskaffee) [Recipes](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/coffee-recipes/)---by [Chris Arnold](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/chris-arnold/)![Making German Ice Cream Coffee (Eiskaffee)](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/eiskaffee/Eiskaffee.png) Eiskaffee is German for Ice Cream Coffee. It is darn simple to make, and really hard to screw up. It is great for hot weather, especially when you want coffee, but not hot coffee. It is somewhat reminiscent of a root beer float, with a little less sweetness and calories. Best of all, it takes just a minute or two to make. ### Basic Ingredients - 2-3 Scoops of vanilla ice cream - 4-8 ounces of cold, double-strength instant or brewed coffee (or double espresso, hot should be OK) - Real whipped cream ### #1 Put your scoops of ice cream in the bottom of the glass ### ![ice cream inside cup ](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/DSC00705.K7O7FhJO_Z19jvY.webp) ### #2 Pour the cold coffee over the ice cream![pour coffee over ice cream](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/DSC00709.CYHAvsR__1IhG17.webp) ### #3 Top with whipped cream![Eiskaffee - Foam](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/DSC00715.sSuVADNx_Z1TckFr.webp) ### Some Variation Ideas - Try another flavor of ice cream, such as Rocky Road or Cookies and Cream - Sprinkle some shaved chocolate sprinkles, cocoa powder, or cinnamon on top - Make it an adult beverage by adding some booze, like whiskey - Try drizzling some caramel sauce on sprinkle a small amount of coarse sea salt on the caramel - You can sprinkle Krokant or Crocant on top, which is a type of nut brittle (usually peanut, hazelnut, or almond) - Best idea yet!

# Espresso as a Lottery Ticket [Espresso](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/espresso/)---by [Michael Allen Smith](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/michael-allen-smith/)![Espresso as a Lottery Ticket](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/espresso-as-a-lottery-ticket/espresso-49th-parallel1.jpg) For the past five years, my coffee drink of choice has been espresso—straight shots, no milk, and no sugar. In my opinion, espresso represents the best potential for coffee. If it is done perfectly, it can be an amazing experience that is remembered long after the beverage is consumed. But getting a perfect shot is a rare thing. There are so many things that can go wrong when espresso is prepared. When you combine that with rising expectations, you have a situation much like a lottery ticket. You pay to play. Sometimes, you win, and sometimes, you lose. Most of the time, the experience is somewhere in the middle—good but nothing memorable.![espresso 49th parallel](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/espresso-49th-parallel1.CvJagdew_vpiFY.webp)_I play the espresso lottery 2-4 times a day._### What Could Go Wrong? Off the top of my head, here is a list of things that could go wrong with preparing an espresso. 1. Sourcing the right green coffee beans. 2. Roasting old beans. 3. Not constructing a good blend or picking the ideal Single Origin offering. 4. The roasting profile fails to bring out the flavors desired. 5. The grinder is too tight or too loose. Seconds are critical to ideal shots. 6. The espresso machine is not maintained. 7. The water temperature is too hot or cold. Some blends require 1/2 degree calibration. 8. Espresso is too fresh or too stale. Different blends will peak on different days from roast. 9. The espresso shot is pulled too fast or too slow. It could be a grinder or tamping issue. 10. The espresso cup is not warmed. This is just what I go through as a home roaster who makes espresso at home. Professional coffee shops have more factors to consider. An espresso shot a few seconds or degrees off could move from perfection to defective. Other coffee brewing methods are more forgiving of time and temperature, but there is little room for error with espresso. However, with risks come rewards like a lottery ticket. ### Rising Expectations What I considered a good espresso back when I started INeedCoffee in 1999, I’d probably spit out today. Moving to Seattle has dramatically increased my expectations for espresso. Trips to Vancouver and Portland also helped turn me into an espresso aficionado. As the espressos get better, so do my expectations. In other words, I now want a higher payout on my lottery ticket.**How I Rate Espresso** I use a 1-5 scale to rate espresso. - **5 – God shot.** The kind of espresso you remember for months, maybe years. The rest of your day is spent in a blissful daze. Extremely rare. - **4—Excellent shot.** Since the God Shot is so rare, I usually hope to get an excellent shot. An excellent shot is still a wonderful thing—a lottery winner. - **3—This is a good shot.** It’s pleasant and drinkable, but it lacks greatness. Fixing a defect could probably improve it to an excellent shot. - **2 – Fair shot.** Drinkable but disappointing. Since my heart can only handle a few espressos daily, I’m always disappointed when I get a fair espresso. I have to wait hours or until the next day before I can play again. - **1 – Awful shot.** Undrinkable. One sip, and you put it down. A losing ticket. A nasty espresso can put you in a nasty mood. The distribution is like a bell curve. The majority of espressos fall in the 2-4 zone, with 3 getting the most representation. ### Increasing Your Lottery Odds At Home If you play at home, the best way to improve the odds that your espresso is outstanding is to get better gear and practice. You’ll also want to use espresso blends that are more temperature-resilient. Many commercial roasters today are constructing amazing blends that expect 1/2 degree precision to really shine. That isn’t going to work for most home espresso machines. You want your blend to have some slack. The best pre-blended espresso blends I’ve had come from _Paradise Roasters_. They also offer unroasted espresso blends for the home roaster. ### Increasing Your Lottery Odds At the Cafe I could probably do an entire article on this topic, but instead, I’ll just hit some main points. Before ordering, you first want to know who roasts the coffee. A good cafe will be proud of its roaster. You’ll also want to track which roasters you like and which you don’t so you aren’t wasting your time trying new cafes that use the same espresso blend. Look for signs that they care about espresso. Not coffee or bagels or waffles, but espresso. Do they have little demitasse cups being warmed on top of the espresso machine? Do they offer a single-origin espresso? Do you see other people drinking espresso or is everyone drinking whipped cream-covered monster lattes? ### Validate Yourself With the Barista The barista makes hundreds of drinks daily, and most customers happily accept defects without complaining. How do you validate yourself? Ask a question that lets them know you are an espresso aficionado. Some examples you can use: 1. Is this the same espresso blend you had a few months ago, or is it a seasonal offering? 2. Do you roast your own espresso blend? (even if you know the answer) 3. Do you ever offer single-origin espressos? Alternate: What other single-origin espressos have they served? 4. Someone at [name a respected coffee place nearby] told me the espresso was excellent. 5. Mention something you saw on their website. With smartphones, you can easily do this minutes before walking into the coffee shop. Another trick I recently started doing is if I know I am going to a new coffee shop or if I am in a new city, I wear one of my coffee roaster t-shirts. At this time, I have three shirts from quality coffee roasters. This is another signal to the barista that I take coffee seriously. It will often trigger a conversation about that roaster, which is great because it allows me to distinguish myself as a customer who cares deeply about quality. I’ve even gotten free drinks using this trick. I’ve used these tricks in places I’ve never been and gotten excellent espresso shots. I’ve watched baristas pour defective shots into lattes ordered by people behind me in line until the shot was just right. Then, when the pull is just perfect, that espresso is handed to me. Score! Another winning ticket in the espresso lottery. ### Resources [6 Reasons I Haven’t Been To Your Coffee Shop](https://criticalmas.org/2010/09/reasons-i-havent-been-to-your-coffee-shop/) – Something I wrote for the Seattle market on validating coffee shops.

# Espresso Blending Techniques [Roasting Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/roasting-coffee/)---by [Steve Leighton](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/steve-leighton/)![Espresso Blending Techniques](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/espresso-blending-techniques/espresso-blending-technquies.jpg) Why just espresso blending? Why not talk about blending in general? Blending for the press pot or filter machine doesn’t need to be as precise. For one, it’s a far weaker part of the cup compared to espresso, and there are rules that can’t be broken in espresso blending that work really well in filter blends. Espresso blending is an art. ### What makes me the expert? Well, I’ve been blending for espresso in the commercial setting of a coffee shop for four years and have created well over 200 blends from 60 different origins in search of the perfect blend, and drunk many thousands of cups of espresso not just for enjoyment (it’s a tough job) but also in the quest for the better espresso. My _Has Bean Espresso_ blend is one of the best-selling coffees I sell, and has received critical acclaim from people in the trade, but more importantly from customers.![espresso shot](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/espresso_shot.q4vJyXRb_Z25949V.webp) ### So, what makes a good blend? I’ve got to start off by saying _I think I know best_ and of course this is true, but these are my rules and not yours. Don’t be afraid to break them if you think it’s going to work. One man’s ristretto is another man’s poison. Good espresso comes from blends. This is the most popular way of thinking in the coffee world, and I have to say that I agree. But in saying that, it is of vital importance that you taste all your single-origin coffees in the espresso machine. Tasting single origins and cupping them lets you know what they taste like alone. So when you are looking for a little sweetness, you can refer to your experiences of tasting it at origin and think _I’ll add some…_ It’s also a good idea to keep detailed notes of cupping experiences and don’t be afraid to go back again and try something else. We all know that one day you try a shot and it’s awful, and the next it’s perfection, so more than one session is important. Also, a good idea can be to cup like the professionals. Only here can you really get a feeling for the coffee. It’s all well and good trying it in the espresso machine, but it can be a lazy way of finding tastes. Make your palate work and here you can compare. Only with comparisons will you understand the real differences between the coffees. Work, work, and work. Your blend will not be done in the first mix. It shouldn’t be done by the 10th attempt. And when it finally is what you’re after, it will change as soon as the next crops rotate in. It’s an ongoing process of cupping, tasting, adapting, and repeat. Your blend will never be finished and if anyone tells you theirs is, don’t trust them. With so many variables going into the espresso no shot is ever going to be the same and no blend is going to be the same.![espresso cooling](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/espresso-cooling1.CscBleCT_Z2ilOyu.webp)_Espresso Cooling_### What makes a bad blend? A bad espresso blend is like no other. If the roaster gets this wrong, he will be lambasted forever and likely lose his customers. If a filter blend isn’t to someone’s taste, he will be forgiven, and it will be put down to the palate, or just not their type of coffee. Also, the ratio of coffee to water is much higher, so mistakes are highlighted. Bad espresso blends are over complicated, under complicated, too smooth, too bitter, too fresh, and too stale… I could go on but I’m sure you get the picture. My favourite espresso blend wouldn’t make my catalogue. It is too rich, full-bodied and expensive for me to sell retail. A roaster’s job is to find some middle ground to keep everyone happy, and not to go too far one way or the other. One rule I always follow is to avoid acidic coffees like Kenyans. As a young and foolish roaster with my love for Kenyan coffee, I thought this could be carried over to my love for espresso. Alas, it was a waste to see a good Kenyan / Costa Rican blend about to be thrown away until I found it to be the best filter blend I had ever created, which I have sold from this day on and is my most popular filter blend in the catalogue. So, even from mistakes, small triumphs can be found. ### Roast A pretty important part of good espresso blending. There are two schools of thought on whether to roast as a blend or separately. For the commercial roaster, it is easier to post blend (and indeed the most popular) as this cuts down on waste. If he has already roasted some Colombian up for an order, it is easy to add the rest of this to the blend. The thinking behind this is that you can treat each bean as an individual. However, I prefer to pre-blend and roast it as a whole. All I can tell you is my experience has shown me that I get the best results this way. You get a more even cup, the blend tastes as if it belongs together. You can get very anal about every part of the process of creating espresso, but I go with what works for me. I agree or at least can relate to David Schomer on most things in his Espresso Coffee Professional Techniques book (which is a _must-read_ for the espresso enthusiast) but on the roast type, we definitely agree. David Schomer calls it a Northern Italian Roast. I call it medium/dark roast. It’s just at the point where the beans look like they want to shine with oils but don’t. A deep mahogany brown. If you take it any further you get a bitter cup which contrary to what Starbucks is trying to tell us is not what good espresso is about. If you must vary the above roast then go a little lighter, but avoid the charcoal blend. ### So come on then, give us your recipe! #### Ethiopian Yirgacheffe As a commercial roaster, I stopped stocking Yirgacheffe for a whole year. This was due to (in my opinion, not the industries) a poor Yirg crop that lacked the vibrancy I associate with it. I went to Sidamo (not bad, certainly better than 2002 crop Yirgacheffe), Djimma (a real mistake – it was a good cup, but the bean grade was very poor, which meant 20 minutes before roasting were spent fishing out the pebbles). However, nothing gives my espresso the lift it needs, like a good Yirgacheffe. So now it’s back, it’s good, and it’s in most of my blends for sure. It gives the cup citrus bursts and combines with the other smoother beans to balance the cup. #### Ethiopian Longberry Harrar I’m a convert. For years I have refused to stock this bean. Why? Well, I put it down to a bad experience and listening to others in the trade. I cupped this way back at the very start of Has Bean online. It was the most rancid cup of coffee I have ever drunk. It was acidic to the max and worse than some robustas I’d tried. So I stayed away, until 2 months or so ago. When I cupped it I decided to buy some there and then. A great addition to a blend, but only in small amounts; it adds some flavour but avoids overpowering your blend. It has a very distinctive taste similar to that of Yemen coffees. #### Brazil Bourbon Fazenda Cachoeira Until only less than 12 months ago the best Brazilian I stocked was a generic Santos. Brazil’s coffee is boring (so I thought), flat and dull so why bother trying to find a single estate that’s going to taste the same as cheap old Santos? Well that was what I thought until I was convinced by a very good friend to try some of this. This sweet smooth little number is perfect in any espresso blend and has definitely improved my blends beyond any other factor. #### Colombian La Manuela Smooth again but without the fresh sweetness of F. Cachoeira. It has a more silky sweetness and gives the cup more body. A substantial bean that sits well in the blend. #### Brazil Santa Terezinha Its smooth subtlety calms down an over-sweet blend and can add substance to one where otherwise you would have “citrus overkill”. This is also great when you have a blend that you think is _there_ but when in fact there is too much going on in the cup. A _calmer_. #### Bolivian Organic A great bean that gives chocolate hints to the blend and roasts like a dream. It’s a great quality bean that adds to any blend. #### ROBUSTA!!! I don’t care what anyone says to me, I’ve never tasted a better espresso blend than one with Robusta. Now small amounts (less than 10%) are rules of thumb, and it’s got to be good quality robusta (there are some out there. In fact I’ve tasted robustas better than some arabica beans I’ve been sent). Don’t be a snob, it adds a little caffeine kick to a blend, and it gives you great crema and balances out the cup. I have great blends without robusta, but none are better than those blends that contain robusta. Don’t let pre-conceptions stop you from trying this; with amounts as low as 10%, you can’t even taste it, but it gives the cup so much more.![espresso shot](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/espresso_shot.q4vJyXRb_Z25949V.webp)_Espresso Shot_### Conclusion This is a brief guide to espresso blending and roasting. I could write a book with recipes and alike in, but I’m wondering how many of you are still awake reading a few pages. It’s all about opinions and taste and of course: mine are right and if you disagree you’re wrong unless, of course, you become a customer, and then it’s _Sorry sir/madam I am a fool_. For me, the blend is the most important part of good espresso. I can get around a useless machine or no tamp, and I can go buy some bottled water. I can buy a stove-top Moka pot for just over a tenner and I’ve used some unusual tamps in the past. But if the blend is bad: well, you can’t make a doppio out of a sow’s ear! ### Resources [Coffee Blending For the Home Roaster](https://ineedcoffee.com/coffee-blending-for-the-home-roaster/) – INeedCoffee article_This article originally appeared on [Too Much Coffee](http://www.toomuchcoffee.com "A meeting place for European coffee enthusiasts").

# Eva Solo Coffee Brewing Tutorial [Brewing Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/brewing-coffee/)---by [Michael Allen Smith](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/michael-allen-smith/)![Eva Solo Coffee Brewing Tutorial](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/eva-solo-coffee-brewing-tutorial/eva-solo-coffee-brewing-tutorial.jpg) When I tell people that my favorite rich coffee brewing method—other than espresso—is the Eva Solo, they usually don’t know what I am talking about. The Eva Solo is also known as a Cafe Solo. What is the Eva Solo? It brews like an upside-down French press with a fine convex filter that descends into the brewing chamber. The glass brewing container resembles a [Chemex](https://ineedcoffee.com/chemex-coffee-brewing-history-and-tutorial/), but without the handle. It is covered with a thin neoprene cover that zips up like a sleeping bag.![Eva Solo Coffee Brewer](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/eva-solo-1-577x650.DXtYIaFi_HQiUz.webp)_Eva Solo Coffee Brewer_ Until I discovered the Eva Solo, my primary full-immersion brewing method was the French Press. As much as I loved the rich flavor of the French press, there were times I wished it were just a little cleaner tasting—not paper filter clean, but something in between. The Eva Solo was exactly what I was looking for. It has all the rich flavor of a French press but is cleaner tasting. Plus, it just looks and feels cool.![Eva Solo Filter](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/eva-solo-filter1-650x396.DqTYBKJ7_BszBk.webp)_Eva Solo Coffee Filter and Lid_ The Eva Solo is as easy to use as a French press. Let’s get started. ### #1 Rinse Eva Solo Rinse the inside of the Eva Solo with warm water. This will remove any residual grounds from the previous brew and minimize temperature loss once we start brewing.![rinse eva solo with hot water](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/eva-solo-pour-water1-534x650.Cn5RBMTK_Z204y23.webp)_Hot Water Rinse_### #2 Add Ground Coffee Grind coffee the same as you would for a French press. It will be on the coarse side. Since you won’t be pressing the grounds to the bottom, you can grind a little finer if you desire. Experiment with different grinds. I use a grind very close to the French press. The dosage is one tablespoon of coffee for each 4 oz of water. Pour ground coffee into the Eva Solo.![Eva Solo Add Coffee Grounds](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/eva-solo-add-coffee1-565x650.BqDl3BGx_1WY4ro.webp)_Add Ground Coffee to Eva Solo_### #3 Add Water Heat water to a boil and then allow it to cool for 20-30 seconds before pouring it into the Eva Solo. Start your brewer timer. If you have an electric kettle that lets you dial in the exact temperature, set it for 202 F if it is a lighter roast and 198F if it is darker.![Add hot water to Eva Solo](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/eva-solo-add-hot-water-528x650.hg6YQVA4_Z1c7RlA.webp)_Pour Hot Water into Eva Solo_### #4 Stir Coffee The Eva Solo comes with a plastic stirrer. I lost mine, so I use a wooden spoon. At the 1-minute mark, give the coffee a gentle stir.![Stir Eva Solo](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/eva-solo-stir-468x650.CPeboMe4_2eoDcI.webp)_After 1 minute, stir the coffee._### #5 Secure Eva Solo Filter Place the filter and lid securely on the Eva Solo.![secure lid on Eva Solo Coffee Brewer](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/eva-solo-secure-lid-452x650.C9CPeTqB_2flgPW.webp)_Secure the filter on the Eva Solo._### #6 Wait 4 Minutes and Pour At the 4-minute mark, the coffee has finished brewing. Serve. Notice how I have one finger holding the filter back in the photo. Although the filter should be secure, I once had it wiggle free and land inside my coffee. It is better to hold it in place while pouring. Safety first!![Pour Eva Solo Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/eva-solo-pour-650x602.BBpWlMTy_2i8pME.webp)_When pouring coffee from the Eva Solo, I advise holding the filter at the top with a finger. This is extra insurance in the event the filter isn’t secure._ The Eva Solo website states that the neoprene cover can keep the coffee warm for up to 30 minutes. Ignore that tip. The brewing is still happening as long as the water and coffee grounds are touching. Once the 4-minute brewing cycle has been completed, pour all the coffee. You can always brew more. What I like about the neoprene cover is it protects me from the glass. One, I don’t burn myself by touching the brewer’s side. Two, the neoprene cover provides some structural protection to the glass. Over the years, I’ve shattered a few French press brewers. I never expected that to happen with the Eva Solo, but if it did, at least the glass and coffee wouldn’t go everywhere. It’ll all be contained inside the zipper. The only downside to the Eva Solo is the cost. You can find one on Amazon for just under $100 as of this writing. Is it worth it? For me, it is worth that price. I love mine. Also, the Eva Solo is far less popular than the French Press, making it a unique gift for coffee fans. ### Resources [Coffee Brewing Guide](https://ineedcoffee.com/coffee-brewing-guide/) – Our collection of coffee brewing tutorials here on INeedCoffee.

# Everything You Wanted to Know About Coffee From Hawaii [Coffee History](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/coffee-history/)---by [Michael Allen Smith](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/michael-allen-smith/)![Everything You Wanted to Know About Coffee From Hawaii](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/everything-you-wanted-to-know-about-coffee-from-hawaii/hawaii-coffee-book1.jpg) Recently, I received a copy of Shawn Steiman’s The Hawaii Coffee Book. It is a concise, colorful book on Hawaiian coffee. It covers a wide range of topics, from island coffee history to the coffee brewing process. According to the book, Hawaii grew 5.7 million pounds of green coffee during the 2006-2007 growing season. Coffee is grown not only on the Big Island (Hawai’i – home of the Kona regions) but also on O’ahu, Maui, Kaua’i, and Moloka’i. Coffee growing on the other islands became more popular in the late 1980s as farms moved away from sugar cane.![Hawaii coffee book](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/hawaii-coffee-book1.B0kBekvf_Ztg71q.webp)_The Hawaii Coffee Book by Shawn Steiman_ Some of the topics covered in the book include: - **Island Guide**: The author posts maps of the coffee-growing regions for each island. If you enjoyed reading Chris Arnold’s article on [Hawaiian Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/hawaiian-coffee/) this section will be a perfect complement. - **Cupping, Roasting, and Grinding Overview**: Not specific to Hawaii, but these parts round out the book nicely. - **Resources**: This section lists all the coffee farms that offer tours and provides contact information, including Kona Earth, which is run by INeedCoffee contributor Gary Strawn. If you are interested in taking a tour of a coffee farm, this section offers a few options. - **Farming**: Growing, Harvesting, and Processing are covered in detail. The Wet, Dry, and newer Mechanical Demulching methods are explained. Mechanical demulching is the newest method and uses far less water than the traditional wet process. - **Hawaiian Coffee Professional Profiles**: Several important people associated with Hawaiian coffee are profiled throughout the book. There is a nice write-up of INeedCoffee contributor Andrew Hetzel (page 65). - **Recipes**: Several pages are devoted to award-winning recipes using Kona coffee. These include main courses, desserts, and drinks. There is even one that uses the porter brewed by Kona Brewing Company, which I was fortunate to visit during my 2004 trip to Oahu. - **Organizations**: Last month, we learned about the WWOOF (Willing Workers on Organic Farms) in the article [Coffee Internship on Kona Farm](https://ineedcoffee.com/coffee-internship-on-kona-farm/). This section covers that program and many others. - **Certification**: This portion of the book goes through Fair Trade, shade-grown, Direct Trade, and how those programs are being used in Hawaii. This book was beautifully edited and has lots of great photos. The only thing I missed on the first read was some information explaining the taste differences between the various growing regions across the islands. When I went back, I noticed the varietal name was listed under the island profile, and a varietal tasting chart was listed at the end of the chapter. A single chart connecting the two might have been clearer. Overall, Shawn Steiman’s The Hawaii Coffee Book was a good book that covered many distinct coffee-related topics in an easy-to-read, colorful manner. Once I get some Kona coffee, I’ll have a few recipes to test. UPDATE (8/1/2008): The author, Shawn Steiman, contacted me regarding listing cupping notes for each island. He explained that the cup profile will vary for reasons like the roast profile, inherent differences between farms (not just islands), and how it was brewed. Too many variables are at play to attach tasting notes on an island or region basis. The descriptions of the varieties should be read with these differences in mind. Also, since taste is a personal experience, he adds, “unless a descriptor is very pronounced and obvious, I don’t like to tell people what they may find.” ### Resources [Hawaiian Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/hawaiian-coffee/) – An island-by-island breakdown of Hawaiian coffee.

# Espresso Tamping Visual Tutorial [Espresso](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/espresso/)---by [Michael Allen Smith](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/michael-allen-smith/)![Espresso Tamping Visual Tutorial](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/espresso-tamping/espresso-tamping-visual-tutorial-ineedcoffee.jpg) To consistently make great espresso, you must have an excellent tamp. This visual tutorial will serve as an initial guide to get you started. Follow the steps below and practice. With practice, your espresso shots will get better and better. Excellent form and consistency are your goals. Let’s get started. You will need ground espresso, a tamper, and a portafilter. Many espresso machines ship with a plastic tamper. Don’t use those. Get a decently weighted tamper. Once you find the correct size of the tamper, you’ll need to decide if you want a flat or convex bottom. If you need help deciding, check out the Resources section at the end of the tutorial. In our example, we use an espresso tamping stand, but this is optional. You can also use any clean, flat surface.![espresso-tamping start](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/espresso-tamping-1.DC4o-uHl_Z8KWS2.webp) ### #1 Confirm the Portafilter Basket is Clean and Dry You will rinse and wipe the portafilter between shots. Over time, you’ll want to do a more extensive cleaning by soaking the basket and portafilter in a dedicated cleaner such as Puro Caff.![espresso tamping](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/espresso-tamping-2.69Mwvg7W_ZlcM2a.webp) ### #2 Add Ground Espresso to the Portafilter Basket Espresso can be ground directly into the portafilter or poured in from another container. A single shot is usually around 7 grams, a double around 14 grams, and a triple around 21 grams. There are baskets for each size, and double baskets are the most common. These weights are a starting point. You can experiment with “up dosing,” which could mean adding a few more grams to the basket. A very good (and often expensive) coffee grinder [fine enough for espresso](https://ineedcoffee.com/coffee-grind-chart/) will go a long way to producing quality and consistency in your espresso shots. The Baratza Virtuoso, Rancilio Rocky, and the Mazzer Mini are three grinders that excel at espresso. Adding the coffee to the basket creates an even bed of grounds. In the photo below you can see the espresso mounds up above the base. This is done to have enough coffee when the grounds are evened out and tamped down.![add espresso to portafilter](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/espresso-tamping-3.D4oa871__Z2uoIID.webp) ### #3 Even the Ground Espresso With Your Finger Draw your finger across the top of the portafilter to even out the shot before tamping.![smooth espresso](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/espresso-tamping-4.929yF1iM_2mnKma.webp) If any grounds are on the rim, brush them aside.![even espresso](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/espresso-tamping-5.DefbWk0H_2hPj4M.webp) ### #4 Tamp the Shot The goal with the tamp is to place an even extraction with about 30 pounds of pressure. You can use a bathroom scale to measure how much weight you put into a tamp. Developing consistent pressure is more important than always hitting 30 pounds of pressure. Your arm should be straight so the tamper evenly matches the coffee bed.![get ready to tamp](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/espresso-tamping-6.WZqSAgqD_Z1wUiNf.webp)![even pressure tamping](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/espresso-tamping-7.BFlV6O0z_2qz0KU.webp) ### #5 (optional) Polish the Shot At this point, you can spin the tamper. This is called polishing and is an optional step. Some say it helps with evening out the tamp, while others say it is cosmetic and unnecessary. There are even specialized “smart” polishers now being sold on eBay that some believe do a better job of evening out the shot.![level espresso tamp](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/espresso-tamping-8-630x650.DvHxxbXe_1tjcys.webp)![finished tamp](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/espresso-tamping-9.C7CPlwxy_Z20PlPu.webp) That is it. You now have an evenly tamped portafilter, which is ready for brewing. ### Last Words Now that you’ve successfully tamped a shot of espresso, the goal is to do it consistently. With practice, you will be able to repeat these steps better and better over time. Use the same tamp technique so that when you are working with a new coffee, there is one less variable to think about. There is one more topic that was not covered, and that is weighing. Once you’ve mastered your tamp, you can start experimenting with more precise dosing. You can get the exact number of grams by placing the portafilter on a kitchen scale and zeroing it out before dosing. Dosing by weight instead of volume can give you more repeatable results when making espresso.

# Espresso Carrot Cake Recipe [Recipes](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/coffee-recipes/)---by [Mads Nordskov](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/mads-nordskov/)![Espresso Carrot Cake Recipe](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/espresso-carrot-cake-recipe/espresso-carrot-cake-recipe.jpg) This cake recipe captures the essence of autumn and winter. Its spices, carrots, nuts, and a hint of delicious coffee make it the perfect dessert for coffee drinkers.![espresso carrot cake setup](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/espresso-carrot-setup.BTa1V-wx_2kLSJ1.webp) ### Ingredients for the Espresso Carrot Cake - 2 cups of sugar - 2 cups of flour (all-purpose) - 2 teaspoons of baking powder - 1 teaspoon of salt - 2 teaspoons of powdered cinnamon - ½ teaspoon of powdered allspice - 4 eggs - 1 cup of cooking oil - 1 cup of pecan nuts (chopped) - 4 cups of carrots (chopped) - ½ cup of raisins - 1 shot espresso ### Ingredients for the frosting - 1 package of cream cheese - 4 cups of powdered sugar - 1 teaspoon of vanilla ### Equipment needed - Electric mixer - Food processor (optional) - 13 x 9-inch cake pan - Measuring cup, measuring spoons![more espresso carrot cake setup 2](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/espresso-carrot-setup2._qj9XTek_1RPEEV.webp) ### Directions In the food processor, chop the carrot and pecan nuts. If you do have a food processor, you can chop the pecans with a knife and the carrots with a carrot grater. Place them on the side. Mix all of the dry ingredients in a large bowl. Set that to the side.![dry ingredients](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/add-espresso-cake.BSkztK_g_2f9Ftd.webp) Pull the shot of espresso (you can use an espresso machine, an AeroPress, or any other method of making espresso). Move that to the side.![pull aeropress shot](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/aeropress-for-cake.NqXpbVDb_1wIcFr.webp) Oil and lightly flour your cake pan. Place it over to the side. Preheat the oven to 350°F. In a mixing bowl, beat the eggs and add the espresso. Add the oil and egg mixture to the dry ingredients, then mix in the carrots. Use your electric mixer on medium speed to blend well. When this is well blended, set the electric mixer aside. Use a spoon to fold in the pecan nuts and raisins. If you do not like raisins, you can leave them out.![Espresso Carrot Cake Mixed](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/espresso-carrot-cake-mixed.By1kHfLU_2bECeJ.webp) Pour the cake batter into the cake pan. Place the pan in the oven and bake for 1 hour. Each oven is different, so be sure to monitor it in case it finishes quicker or needs extra time.![espresso cake pan](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/espresso-cake-pan.DbSXvC2w_Z1bPdYP.webp) ### Prepare the frosting Put two cups of powdered sugar into a mixing bowl. Open the package of cream cheese, then cut it into cubes. You can soften the cheese by putting it into a microwave oven for a minute on high heat. If you do not own a microwave oven, you can just leave the cream cheese out of the fridge for a while instead. Blend the softened cream cheese with powdered sugar and add the vanilla. Use the electric mixer to make the frosting smooth. Once this half of the frosting is well blended, add two more cups of powdered sugar. ### Finishing the Cake Let the cake cool down for at least ten minutes after baking. Once the cake has cooled, add the frosting and enjoy.![espresso carrot cake](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/espresso-carrot-cake.B2WHlCRr_Z1DQg46.webp) ### Resources [Making Lattes Without an Espresso Machine](https://ineedcoffee.com/making-lattes-without-espresso-machine/) – Use your AeroPress to make an “espresso-like” shot.

# Espresso Pumpkin Pie [Recipes](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/coffee-recipes/)---by [Lura Lee](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/lura-lee/)![Espresso Pumpkin Pie](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/espresso-pumpkin-pie/2902181949_c15cb08762_o.jpg) I always crave pumpkin pie as soon as the first leaves start turning colors or the crisp autumn breeze turns my cheeks red. This year, I expanded upon my old pumpkin pie recipe and improved it by adding espresso. It’s a simple recipe using canned pumpkin. The purist bakers among the crowd can modify a _from scratch_ pumpkin pie recipe accordingly, if they have the patience to fool around with whole pumpkins, but this recipe is for the majority of people who want the pie minus the fuss.![espresso pumpkin pie](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/2903024558_ef19aac195_o.Ccpw7dTF_1X6dgw.webp)_Espresso Pumpkin Pie_### Why Espresso? Many pies are too sweet for me. I prefer a slightly more complex taste, and you’ll get that when you add espresso to a pumpkin pie. In this recipe, I used espresso as both a spice and a liquid ingredient, and I think that it really adds something special to the taste. Give it a try; you won’t be disappointed.![espresso](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/2902246165_81a820f130_o.BqScdUiu_28fsmI.webp) ### Ingredients - 2 shots of espresso - A 29 oz. can of pumpkin puree - 1 3/4 cups (22 oz.) of evaporated milk - 4 large eggs - 1 1/2 cups of sugar - 1 1/2 teaspoons of ground cinnamon - 1 teaspoon of allspice - 1 1/2 teaspoons of finely ground espresso - 2 “deep dish” 9 inches, pre-fab. pie crusts ### The Secret The secret to making a good, fluffy/creamy pumpkin pie (instead of one that is heavy) comes down to the eggs. Separate the eggs. Put the egg yolks into a large bowl, and the egg whites in a small bowl off to the side. Whip the egg whites to stiff peaks and set them to the side. ### The Big Bowl Add the pumpkin puree, evaporated milk, sugar, and spices to the big bowl, which already includes the egg yolks. Use a spoon to mix the ingredients.![before mixing](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/2902179943_d1e57146e4_o.CjbBk2Ij_Z1dzHrc.webp) In the picture above, I used a Turkish coffee hand-grinder to add the ground espresso. Next, I poured in the espresso shots.![pour in espresso shots](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/2902180439_f04a2e67d5_o.DgxP7PWH_2bbGqz.webp) Keep in mind the following: the recipe on the back of the pumpkin can suggests using 24 oz. of evaporated milk. Since I added 2 oz. of espresso, I subtracted that amount of milk from the recipe on the can.![pour into bowl](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/2903022618_a0a2d3b3a2_o.B1IAlRAp_Z1kPKAO.webp)![mix into bowl](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/2903022730_c1e7059176_o.m8WUmZKw_2kD032.webp) ### The Big Mix Up Fold in the egg whites then stir them in, then use an electric mixer on medium speed to mix the ingredients. This whips a lot of air into the pie filling, which will give the pie a fluffy and light texture after baking.![fold egg whites](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/2903022916_f6e55f0874_o.BaJ9N4nr_2fW6bQ.webp)![use blender](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/2902181485_8ec04d2b3e_o.Cwq-r6b3_XFHDL.webp)![pie crusts](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/2902181689_7810d80292_o.Bl_qqgAl_2oqLS1.webp)![fill pie crusts](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/2902181851_be06d7665e_o.Dyj8_iUc_Z1o9gd9.webp) ### Into the Fire Bake the pies at 425 degrees Fahrenheit for 15 minutes. After that, lower the temperature to 325 degrees for approximately 40 minutes. Use a clean, dry knife to check the pies. If the knife comes out clean, the pies are done. When the pies have been baked thoroughly, pull them out of the oven and cool them on a baking rack for at least 30 minutes before serving.![pie in oven](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/2903024438_3ea3c9a700_o.Bg_w7Q_C_1FXY32.webp)_Photos by Carl Melville._ Published on September 26, 2015--- #### Lura Lee Lura Lee enjoys coffee, but no longer pursues coffee as a hobby.

# Exploring the Best Coffee Roasters in America [Coffee Business](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/coffee-business/)---by [Michael Allen Smith](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/michael-allen-smith/)![Exploring the Best Coffee Roasters in America](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/exploring-the-best-coffee-roasters-in-america/coffee-roasters.jpg) Prior to the COVID lockdowns, I loved exploring new coffee shops. It was my sport. I’ve been to hundreds of different coffee shops, mostly along the West Coast, from British Columbia to San Diego. During a six-month period in 2014, I visited almost 70 different cafes just in the San Francisco Bay Area. With the lockdown, I found a new way to explore coffee: the roasters. This year, I have been traveling around the country with my web browser, exploring numerous great American coffee roasters. In this article, I want to share some of my favorites. I also want to share with the coffee roasters who might be reading the things I like and dislike about ordering coffee online. The ordering process for coffee is much better than it was just two years ago. Most excellent roasters now have top-notch secure e-commerce websites that simplify ordering coffee. A few years ago, I compiled a list of tips for [finding a good coffee roaster subscription online](https://ineedcoffee.com/guide-coffee-mail-order-subscriptions/). Those tips also apply to single purchases. Before I tell you the coffee I tried, let me tell you what type of coffee I like. I prefer lighter-roasted single-origin coffee. I make almost all my coffee in the [AeroPress](https://ineedcoffee.com/upside-aeropress-coffee-brewing-tutorial/) or as [cold brew in the Penguin](https://ineedcoffee.com/make-concentrated-cold-brew-coffee-with-the-penguin-coffee/). If you are a fan of dark roast coffee, my list may not be of much value to you. My advice for those who like coffee on the dark side is to take up home coffee roasting or find some really good medium roasts, as dark-roasted coffee goes stale quickly. See my article [Hacking Dark Roast – Tips on Brewing a Better Bold Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/hacking-dark-roast-tips-on-brewing-a-better-bold-coffee/) for more guidance. ### How to Not Earn My Business There are many great coffee roasters that I decided not to order from once I got to their website. The three pet peeves I have for coffee roaster sites are: 1. The shipping information is not displayed clearly at the top of the website. When I get to a site, I want to see how many bags of coffee I need to order for free shipping. If I can’t tell the shipping cost until I build a shopping cart, I’ll bail and go to another site. Also, I’ll bail if I need to buy more than three bags. Ideally, I want free shipping on two bags. That seems to be common with many roasters these days. 2. Not being 100% Secure. That means every page on the site must display a secure lock in the browser’s address bar. Many sites don’t load their page assets securely, so the lock appears with a line through it. It may still be secure, but it looks sloppy. I’m not entering my credit card number on a sloppy e-commerce site. 3. Sub-12-ounce bags. With the exception of a clearly marked bag or a limited release, I’m not interested in supporting roasters that sell their wares in 250-gram bags. I know I am not alone on this point. _“When you make your 9 or 10-ounce bags look like 12 oz bags by using tiny fonts or hiding the ounces altogether, you may fool the customer once or twice, but you’ll lose their trust eventually.”_4. Sites that offer free shipping with a code, but you can’t find the page where you saw the code, so you spend more time figuring out how to earn the free shipping than ordering the coffee. The best e-commerce stores just offer free shipping at a certain dollar point. No silly codes are needed. ### My Favorite Mail Order Coffee Roasters this Year My list is weighted towards West Coast roasters because I know the coffee scene better here. They excel at the lighter-roasted single origin that I prefer. I also discovered that West Coast roasters tend to have nicer, more modern websites. #### California - Verve Coffee (Santa Cruz) - Temple Coffee Roasters (Sacramento) - Chromatic  Coffee (San Jose) - Dune Coffee (Santa Barbara) - Coffee and Tea Collective (San Diego) - The Boy & The Bear (Los Angeles)![chromatic coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/chromatic-coffee.DrSErjky_1sdI1P.webp) #### Illinois - Intelligentsia Coffee (Chicago)![Intelligentsia coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/intelli-3-pack.ByWRyX5l_Z1zfsrQ.webp) #### Michigan - Madcap Coffee Company #### Oregon - Roseline Coffee (Portland) - Push X Pull (Portland) - Water Ave Coffee (Portland) - Bespoken Coffee Roasters (Corvallis)![Push X Pull coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/push-x-pull.CUx7kpH__Z3y16R.webp) #### Washington - Kuma Coffee (Seattle) - Olympia Coffee Roasting (Olympia) - Blossom Coffee Roasters (Vashon)![blossom coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/blossom-coffee.C1NlTHgh_1bRosB.webp) #### Wisconsin - Ruby Coffee Roasters (Nelsonville) - JBC Coffee Roasters (Madison)![jbc coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/jbc-coffee.DVQT41uo_dPk2l.webp) ### Finding More Roasters I love this quest to explore the best coffee roasters in America.

# Caffe Freddo (Chilled Espresso) [Recipes](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/coffee-recipes/)---by [Ben Brown](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/ben-brown/)![Caffe Freddo (Chilled Espresso)](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/espresso-drinks-for-summer/pour350.jpg) I will happily drink hot coffee any time of year. I have been good-naturedly derided for firing up the espresso machine on a ninety-degree afternoon. I went into a cafe and ordered a latte in August. I even drank coffee with verve after working all day in the steamy weather of a tropical fishing village in Nicaragua. In short, I’m not shy about drinking hot coffee on a hot day. There are times, however, when an iced coffee hits the spot. The question is: how do you brew a hot coffee and chill it quickly without watering it down? There is, in fact, a cheap, easy way of icing any coffee or tea drink on the spot. All you need is a cocktail shaker. Simply pour your drink into the mixer with three or four ice cubes, shake until cold, and strain your beverage into an appropriate glass. It’s simple enough, and this formula should work well for almost any coffee drink.![ice in cocktail shaker](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/start3501.DJoowTSR_Z1iUcNC.webp)_Ice inside a cocktail shaker_ If you’re going to go out and buy a cocktail shaker, you’ll need to decide which style you want to purchase. The one I own consists of a cup-like base and a two-piece lid with a built-in strainer and removable cap. This works nicely because it doesn’t require any special skill to use, and it reliably leaves a good crema on my espresso. There is another style of mixer that consists of two cups that fit together to create a sealed compartment for shaking the beverage. I get the impression that this kind of mixer is less common. I have not used a two-cup shaker, and it looks difficult, so I’m sticking to the three-piece model, if for no other reason, in the interest of keeping my precious coffee off the kitchen floor. I’m sure, however, that the two-piece style ultimately works just as well as its three-piece counterpart. Now that you have your shaker, you’re ready to start icing. Remember that it’s better to put in too much ice than too little. If you don’t use enough, you’ll just end up with a lukewarm (and rather unsatisfying) drink. With that in mind, have fun! I’ve included some of my favorite iced coffee recipes below to provide a starting point, but I maintain that just about any drink can be iced. It just takes a little creativity.![Prepare espresso shots](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/iced350.BokmgIIm_oOcYD.webp)_Prepare espresso shots_### Caffe Freddo (Chilled Espresso) Begin with a double shot of espresso. Pour your drink into a cocktail mixer with three ice cubes. Shake well. Strain it into an empty glass. If you do it just so, you should be able to obtain a long-lasting, foamy crema on top of the drink.![Chilled Espresso](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/pour350.BYiVImDC_Z16Q9Bd.webp)_Chilled Espresso_### Iced Cafe Americano Begin with a double shot of espresso. Add an equal portion of water. Pour your drink into a cocktail mixer with three ice cubes. Add milk or cream to taste. Shake well. Strain it into a glass with fresh ice. ### Regular Iced Coffee Make a glassful of regular coffee in your preferred method (drip or French press). Pour your drink into a cocktail mixer with four ice cubes. Add milk or cream to taste. Shake well. Strain it into a glass with fresh ice. ### Iced “Latte” Begin with a double shot of espresso. Add an equal portion of milk. Pour your drink into a cocktail mixer with three ice cubes. Shake well. Strain it into a glass with fresh ice.

# Ethiopian Coffee [Coffee History](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/coffee-history/)---by [Chris Arnold](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/chris-arnold/)![Ethiopian Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/ethiopian-coffee/kaldi1.gif) When most people talk about Ethiopia, they immediately think of coffee. Maybe you have heard that Ethiopia was the birthplace of coffee, or at least the discovery of it. We will discuss the Ethiopian lore of goat herder Kaldi, the Ethiopian coffee regions and all their wonderful flavors, and the Ethiopian Coffee Ceremony – still alive after hundreds of years. Going back in time, The Ethiopian Kaffa region was the southwestern side of Ethiopia and its capital city was Jimma. The Ethiopian word for coffee is Bunna, Buni, or Bun. So you can see how Kaffa Bun, became Coffee Bean. ### Kaldi and His Goats This is just one variation on the Kaldi story: More than a thousand years ago, Kaldi, an Abyssinian goat herder, saw his goats acting strangely. They were said to almost be dancing on their hind legs. Upon further investigation, he saw they were eating red cherries from some wild bushes. Intrigued, he tried some of the berries and soon knew why his goats were dancing about. He gathered several berries, took them to his wife, and she proclaimed them from God. She sent him off to the monastery to see the monks. The head monk proclaimed them the work of the devil. Throwing them onto the fire, the monastery soon filled with the aroma of roasting coffee, and the monks came out of the woodwork to find the source. These monks salvaged the coffee beans, and in an effort to stamp out the embers, the monks crushed them. In an effort to preserve them, they were placed in a large pitcher with hot water. The monks drank the hot brew that night and vowed they would drink the concoction every day. It seemed like a perfect remedy for those late-night devotion sessions. There are other legends that go back even further, claiming that the berries were chewed on raw. While it would be nice to have one story that was historically accurate, the reality is probably that all stories contain a lot of fiction, sprinkled with a little truth. But why spoil such romantic tales?![Kaldi](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/kaldi1.DevxS7Ad_ZuwfR5.webp)_Kaldi_### Ethiopian Coffee Regions Today, there are many regions in Ethiopia that produce unique tasting coffees. They are all Arabica strains, just like the ones Kaldi found. No robusta here! They are sometimes wet-processed (usually called washed), and sometimes dry-processed (usually indicated by a “DP”). The dry-processed beans tend to be more fruity.![Ethiopia Map](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/ethiopiamap.9GkxsVmv_Z269XAD.webp)_Ethiopia Map_ The Ethiopian Harrar coffee region is becoming well-known for its fruity, blueberry aroma, as well as spice and licorice. The Ethiopian Sidamo coffee region (where we get Yirgacheffes) is also well-known. Some notable examples are Sidamo, Idido Misty Valley (IMV), Lekempti, and your garden variety Yirgacheffe, also spelled Yergecheffe. The Sidamo Dry Process (DP) is known for its fruit punch characteristics. The IMV is known for its raspberry and strawberry overtones. Lekempti can have mango, tangerine, citrus, and tropical fruit characteristics. Your standard Yirgacheffe is traditionally known for lemon and citrus. ### Ethiopian Coffee Ceremony The Ethiopian Coffee Ceremony is part of Ethiopian Life, it is lengthy, and it is beautiful. A sign of hospitality and respect, a visitor is almost always invited to share in the ceremony, regardless of the hour. Usually conducted by a lone young woman, typically in colorful traditional garb. First, the Jebena, (an oddly-shaped dark clay coffee pot) is placed in a bed of grass. The roasting is done in a pan over a wood or charcoal stove, along with the ubiquitous smell of incense. The Ethiopian coffee beans are stirred in the pan, while the chaff is being whisked away. Once roasted, the coffee Ethiopian coffee is ground in a pestle and mortar. It is then added to the Jabena with hot water and then strained several times through a fine filter. Some people roast very light and others roast darker.![Jabena](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/jabena.IeLLV-i8_2aJB9N.webp)_Jabena_ The resulting coffee is served in small teacups. The skilled woman can pour a stream of coffee from as much as 2 feet, into that tiny little cup. Much of the coffee in Ethiopia is served with sugar, but some rural areas actually serve it with salt. Either way, you will not find milk here. You may also be served some local snack food favorites to go along with your coffee. The ceremony is actually not just for guests or special occasions. Generally, it takes place 3 times daily. It is like the western water cooler. A place to discuss the tritest, to the most serious. If you are invited inside a home to partake, there is a 3 cup rule. Drinking any less is considered impolite. Making the coffee can take as long as 1 hour. Drinking it can be another hour as well. What a relaxing change from the “Get in, get out” mentality of Starbucks! ### Conclusion Next time you see an Ethiopian coffee offered at your local Starbucks, maybe you can tell the Barista a thing or two about the origins of coffee – whether it be fact or folklore!

# Espresso Machine Terminology – Clarity for the Caffeinated Connoisseur [Espresso](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/espresso/)---by [Andreanne Hamel](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/andreanne-hamel/)![Espresso Machine Terminology – Clarity for the Caffeinated Connoisseur](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/espresso-machine-terminology-clarity-for-the-caffeinated-connoisseur/milk-froth-coffee.jpg) Love the taste of freshly brewed espresso but are confused by some of the language used to describe the processes, machinery, and serving suggestions? Well, then you’ve come to the right place. Following is an alphabetized list of easy-to-understand definitions for some of the most commonly used terms. ### Barista The term is used to describe a person who has reached an expert level of espresso-making, whether professionally-trained or personally achieved, through practice. A Barista also possesses a wide knowledge of all things coffee. It’s an Americanized word derived from the Italian phrase for ‘bartender’ as most Baristas prepare and serve espresso from behind a cafe counter or ‘bar’. ### Basket The shape of an espresso machine’s basket plays a very important part in the overall brewing process. Make sure to choose one with a straight-walled basket because curved sides will create an uneven brew and ultimately, deter from the taste of your espresso. ### Boiler Correct boiler pressure is imperative because it determines the amount of water that will be incorporated into the steaming process. So, if milk is not foaming to your satisfaction, check the boiler pressure setting on your machine and refer to your user manual for information and/or a phone number you can call to request professional guidance. ### Brewing Time Brewing is the method by which water passes through the grounds. It’s recommended that brewing time be kept to around 30 seconds for an espresso shot, to avoid the coffee deteriorating in flavor. ### Brush Between dispensed shots, use a brush to clean out espresso ground deposits that have settled into your machine. This will keep it running efficiently and provide the best-tasting beverage. ### Burr Grinder Describes two revolving mechanical elements of a grinder that crush or tear the beans. Milling the beans in this manner produces consistent ground size, lessening the risk of burning and maximizing both aroma and taste. ### Crema Crema is the creamy foam that appears on top of a well-brewed cup of espresso. The crema color varies between pale and reddish-brown depending on the brewing process and coffee strength.![Espresso at Neptune Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/neptune-coffee-espresso1.svmtsjR6_1STOsA.webp) ### Descaler An agent commonly used in powder, pod, or liquid form for cleansing espresso machine parts. Descalers remove deposits from the boiler and brewing mechanisms to keep your machine healthy and consistently produce the highest quality results. ### Doser A doser is the part of a grinder that automatically releases a pre-determined amount of coffee grounds for brewing. Some machines are equipped with adjustable dosers, while others aren’t. Single-shot servings, or doses, are usually around 7-9 grams, while a 14-18 gram dose merits a double shot. ### Froth Froth is the foam covering the surface of a cup of espresso, cappuccino, latte, etc. It’s a result of rendering and aerating the milk via the steaming process.![frothy coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/milk-froth-coffee.CSGkPmqA_1rmORF.webp) ### Group Head This is the main chamber of an espresso machine that draws pressurized steam through the coffee. A group head describes a multi-faceted fixture that allows for dispensing into multiple cups at once. ### Long A two-ounce shot of espresso is also referred to as a long (shot). ### Portafilter The part of an espresso machine that has a handle to facilitate manipulation and which holds the basket storing the grounds during the brewing process. It is cupped in appearance and should be kept clean, exhibiting a shiny, metallic surface for best, continued results.![naked portafilter](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/naked-portafilter1.BxxZSo7V_24tty9.webp) ### Pump This is the mechanism within an espresso machine that creates the correct amount of pressure, allowing the pistons to operate properly. A widely-used variant of the pump consists of between 8-10 bars of pressure. ### Ristretto Describes the term used for a 1 ounce, ‘short shot’ of espresso. Many connoisseurs opt for this serving size as the brewing process differs somewhat from a standard shot of espresso (2 oz) and results in more profound robustness of flavor. ### Seal The part of the espresso machine that acts as a buffer, preventing any water from seeping through the mechanisms and away from the end product. ### Steam Wand This is the pipe on the front of the espresso machine which is used to release steam for frothing milk to top a cup of espresso. ### Tamper A tamper is the mechanical part of the espresso machine used for compressing, or pressurizing, the grounds within the filter basket. This process is referred to as ‘tamping’ and is recognized as a forgotten art form. Tamping pressure is most commonly applied in increments of 20 and then 30 pounds of pressure for the highest quality. ### Water Filter For best results, water used to make espresso should always be filtered. Something to keep in mind if you’re in the market for an espresso machine is that some come equipped with their own, built-in water filter, while others do not. ### Water Temperature Espresso machine water temperatures vary but should be stabilized at 92-93 C to produce the best-tasting espresso.

# Extending the Life of Your Bodum Cordless Electric Kettle [Brewing Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/brewing-coffee/)---by [Michael Allen Smith](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/michael-allen-smith/) While researching a new electric kettle online, I stumbled upon the reviews of my current hot water heater: the Bodum 5410-03USA Mini Ibis Electric Water Kettle. Although there were various criticisms, the bulk of the complaints were related to the defective switch. I’ve owned one for years, and I knew exactly what they were talking about. I have an easy workaround. First, let me describe the problem. After you finish using the kettle, place it back onto its holder. Only now do youn’t want to heat water, so you don’t want it to switch on. The switch should stay down. It doesn’t always stay down, and as some reviewers indicate, it goes into a flickering mode. Eventually, the switch gets worn out, and the kettle stops working.![bodum-electric-kettle](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/bodum-electric-kettle1.DQH7Nmgj_vP9rJ.webp)_Don’t store your Ibis Electric Water Kettle like this when not used._ If you want a long life out of your Bodum Cordless Electric Kettle, I advise keeping the kettle on the stand only when it is heating water. **Set it sideways when you aren’t using it.** Mine has lasted years. The one I donated to my office died quickly because people returned it fully on the stand when not using it. The switch eventually gave out, and it had to be thrown away.![store-bodum-kettle-sideways](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/store-bodum-kettle-sideways.D2ylE_5R_ZOpiV8.webp)_Store Ibis Kettle Sideways to extend its life._### Resources [The Hamilton Beach Cool Touch Tea Kettle Review](https://ineedcoffee.com/the-hamilton-beach-cool-touch-tea-kettle-review/) – This is the kettle I bought to replace my Ibis.

# Fair Trade Coffee Interview with TransFair Canada [Coffee Business](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/coffee-business/)---by [Arthur Montague](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/arthur-montague/)![Fair Trade Coffee Interview with TransFair Canada](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/fair-trade-coffee-klatching/ecuador_andes.jpg) Coffee is the world’s second-largest agricultural commodity after cotton, a $10 billion a year industry employing 25 million people (2001). 100 coffee beans are needed to make one cup of coffee, according to Conservation International, and they should know. The harvest of one tree will yield 40 cups of coffee. Clearly, coffee is much more in our food chain than a luxury add-on. Given the amount of arable land used to grow coffee, environmental and economic considerations doubtless should draw some scrutiny. Indeed, they are. On the economic side, the vulnerability of small coffee producers to multinational market manipulation relative to accessing conventional food production and distribution systems has made coffee a natural commodity for experimentation in the creation of sustainable alternative food trading systems. Fair Trade is one such alternative system, and, to date, perhaps the most successful.![ecuador andes](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/ecuador_andes.DtqcDjwn_dvk7c.webp)_The foothills of the Andes are prime coffee sources._### Coffee Key to Fair Trade Success To learn more about Fair Trade, we went to the Managing Director of TransFair Canada (Fair Trademark of Canada), Caroline Whitby. And, of course, because talking coffee without Starbucks is like talking ice cream without Ben and Jerry’s, we also went to Starbucks. Opening this up is our interview with Caroline Whitby. Starbucks turned out to figure in another story.**Caroline Whitby** is the Managing Director of TransFair Canada. She has worked on community development programs overseas, as an advisor and manager. She has also done consulting work in Canada in cross-cultural training and services to high-tech industries. Her academic background lies in international development studies and business management. Caroline lives in Ottawa, Canada with her partner and two children.**QUESTION:** The Kathy Gifford-child labor allegations pertaining to the rag trade pointed up a significant flaw in the “ethical trade” notion that corporate bodies would police themselves and adhere to international labor conventions that, presumably, have the status of law in signatory countries. How does Fair Trade differ from “ethical trade”?**RESPONSE:** Fair Trade and ethical trade are two distinct mechanisms aiming to improve the incomes and working conditions of workers and producers outside North America and Europe. Both are borne out of consumer concerns for the origin and conditions of production of goods or services they purchase. Fair Trade seeks to address the unfair trading conditions met by third-world producers when dealing in international markets. Fair Trade is purely a civil society initiative that began with the emergence of alternative trading organizations. These organizations developed direct trading relationships for products such as coffee to ensure a better price paid to producers. With the emergence of labeling initiatives and the Fairtrade Labeling Organizations International (FLO), mainstream companies began dealing in Fair Trade, dealings independently monitored by the FLO. The standards developed by FLO are enforced by labeling organizations such as TransFair Canada and TransFair USA, thus assuring consumers that producers received a fair deal.**QUESTION:** For marketing purposes, a Fair Trade certification label could carry enough cachet among consumers for retailers to see it as a valuable sales aid; a hot button, if you will. However, does a Fair Trade label certify “fair trade” throughout the commodity system; that is, from grower to retailer?**RESPONSE:** Yes. The Fair Trade label ensures that all steps in the chain from the producer to the consumer have been monitored. Otherwise, it would not be possible to assure the consumer that a commodity is fairly traded. Let me give you an example of how the certification process works for coffee. First, producer cooperatives are registered and monitored by FLO to make sure members receive the benefit of Fair Trade transactions. Importers are also monitored, either by the central FLO register or the national initiative, TransFair USA, for example, in the US. Importers are obliged to produce reports on their transactions with the registered cooperatives and provide evidence that they paid the pre-set minimum price or the premium to the producers. These reports are subject to independent audits. Roasters are also licensed and monitored by FLO. By contract, they are committed to reporting their purchases, roasting activities, and sales of Fair Trade coffee. They are also subject to verifications and agree to display the FairTrade logo according to standards in the contract. Usually, the chain ends with the roaster, who sells packaged and labeled coffee to distributors or retailers. In some cases, companies buy roasted coffee and package it themselves. They are also licensed by TransFair or FLO and fulfill the same reporting and auditing requirements as roasters. For other products certifiable by FLO, a similar chain of custody exists. In the case of cocoa-based products, which contain non-FairTrade ingredients, criteria are defined as to what constitutes an adequate percentage of Fair Trade ingredients.![puerto rico green coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/puerto_rico.CRGxrxAq_gSPba.webp)_Puerto Rico green coffee._**QUESTION: What are the certification criteria for fairly traded coffee?****RESPONSE:** Basically there are four, and they weigh variably within the growing-processing-marketing systems. First, a minimum price. Second, the purchase of beans from democratically organized small growers, usually a formal growers cooperative. Third, is the provision of pre-harvest credit; in other words, a tangible sharing of risk. Fourth, agreement to purchase on a long-term rather than one-time basis. These are the general parameters and they are regularly monitored for compliance.**QUESTION:** We talk about small producers. In some parts of North America, a small producer is a farmer with thirty acres, in other parts the small producer has two or three sections.**What is the Fair Trade threshold at which small producers are no longer considered small?****RESPONSE:** The answer to that may be found in the eligibility criteria for producer cooperatives. To be eligible, a producer cooperative must have a majority of members who are small-scale producers of coffee. Small producers are understood as those that are not structurally dependent on hired labor, managing their farm mainly with their own and their family’s labor force. Further defining “small scale”, the FLO coffee register uses a production threshold of 3000 pounds of unprocessed coffee. In some areas, where land productivity is high, the threshold can be increased to 5000 pounds. The average landholding of cooperative members is one to two hectares. During the harvest period, most of the time the whole family works, including the children. In Honduras and Nicaragua school holidays coincide with the picking season. Most families do not hire labor, and, if they do, the number rarely exceeds two or three persons. There is currently no mechanism within the monitoring framework to determine the fate of these hired workers. Our monitoring focuses on the cooperative, of which family farms are members, to ensure members control the institution and in that way control the proceeds of sales. In the case of products that are produced on estates or plantations using hired labor, such as tea, the eligibility criteria focus on the employment conditions and worker representation, rather than on farm size.**QUESTION:** Statistics indicate that the production capacity of the Fair Trade certified producer cooperatives is substantially higher than actual Fair Trade sales.**Does this variance between capacity and sales mean that much of these crops are not fairly traded?****RESPONSE:** Admittedly, the market for Fair Trade coffee is much smaller than the production capacity of the registered cooperatives. On average, cooperatives sell only a portion of their coffee on the Fair Trade market and channel the balance through conventional markets. The cooperatives are generally able to manage the export themselves, which means the conventional sales will still be more direct than using the normal routing through local middlemen. That some of their coffee is Fair Trade, with a guaranteed price, also provides the cooperatives with some leverage in their dealings with other markets. The current Fair Trade registry includes 164 cooperatives, representing 500,000 members and their families. This represents a production of 78.7 million kilograms for 1999. Of that coffee, 12.5 million kilograms, or 22% was sold on the Fair Trade market. The percentage varies enormously from country to country, and even from one cooperative to another. Some of the factors that influence how much a cooperative can sell as Fair Trade are the quality of its coffee, the contacts it has developed with buyers, the popularity of the coffee origin it sells, and many more. The slowing down of sales growth of coffee overall in some European countries has caused a bottleneck in the system, and the world is looking to North America, particularly the US, for the next wave of expansion. In Canada, sales of certified Fair Trade coffee have grown tremendously since 1998, increasing from 22 metric tons sold to 150 metric tons in the year 2000.**QUESTION:** More and more consumers are linking personal health to broader environmental and economic issues. Growing concern about the labeling of genetically modified food is a case in point. Do Fair Trade certification address environmental concerns and their relationships to economic interests?**RESPONSE:** Fair Trade certification deals indirectly with environmental issues by involving the cooperatives in a dialogue on integrated development and sustainability. More specifically, cooperatives often have developmental goals that encompass issues of economic, social, and environmental sustainability. Cooperatives are encouraged and supported to adopt measures to improve quality and to apply production and processing techniques that respect the specific ecosystems and contribute to the conservation and sustainable use of natural resources in order to avoid as much as possible, or even totally, the use of chemical inputs. In the case of bananas, minimum and process criteria are more defined, with the view of prohibiting certain chemicals and regulating the use of others. Environmental questions are dealt with less in the certification process than in the relationship that develops between the FLO and the producer cooperatives. In practice, however, almost all Fair Trade coffee is grown under shade cover on small farms where traditional growing and harvesting methods are used. In this context, FLO encourages producers to invest in organic methods, rather than chemicals, to improve production. In the case of coffee, environmentally sound practices do lead to a higher quality product and thus a better return for the farmer.**QUESTION:** Foods certified organic are experiencing a phenomenal demand among consumers, with close to a 20% increase annually and no end in sight. In 1994, Starbucks indicated it has no interest in promoting organic coffee. Now they can barely get enough. To what extent is Fair Trade coffee also certified organic?**RESPONSE:** As of February 2001, nearly 41% of the cooperatives on the FLO register are either already certified organic or in the process of becoming certified organic. Organic coffee is the fastest growing niche within Fair Trade, representing 28% of 1999 actual sales, up from 19% the previous year. Since organic coffee fetches an important premium even on the conventional market, organic certification allows producer cooperatives to further expand their sales opportunities.**QUESTION:** Fair Trade certification is a value-added that ultimately is paid by the consumer. That suggests the need for a buoyant economy and a continuing, somewhat upscale, market for Fair Trade coffee. Will Fair Trade coffee and other Fair Trade products, therefore, remain a niche product, or will there ever be a time when Fair Trade products will be accessible to lower-income consumers; in short, benefitting poor consumers as well as poorer producers?**RESPONSE:** The price difference between Fair Trade and conventional coffee depends on the quality of the coffee, the form in which it is sold, and the difference between the world price and the Fair Trade minimum price. Being Fair Trade certified is, then, only one determinant of price. In Canada and to a large extent in the United States, Fair Trade coffee has mostly been considered a specialty product and priced accordingly. At the same time, the scope of origins and products has gradually expanded to include more mainstream origins and blends. Several certified Fair Trade coffees are sold in supermarkets at mid-range prices and appeal to an increasing portion of coffee drinkers. There are limits, however, as to how low retail prices can go. The world price is currently 60 cents (US) per pound, whereas the minimum price for Fair Trade coffee is 126 cents (US). In practice, this means that Fair Trade coffees cannot be priced as low as a typical supermarket blend sold by a multinational. Some of the Fair Trade coffees are currently priced in the $5.00 per pound retail price range, which is fairly accessible. When coffee is sold by the cup, the difference in price between Fair Trade and conventional evaporates to a mere four or five cents per cup.

# Fair Trade Coffee for Who? [Coffee Business](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/coffee-business/)---by [Steve Leighton](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/steve-leighton/)![Fair Trade Coffee for Who?](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/fair-trade-for-who/green-coffee1.jpg)_A counterview to the Fair Trade Debate_ This article discusses and investigates what fair trade is, what I don’t like about it, and the alternatives that exist. Has Bean made a bold statement in 2002, to no longer stock any Fair Trade products. This hurt us financially and meant that some of our customers went elsewhere. I make no apologies for my position on this and will use the following article to explain why, and how these decisions were made. To start off, I’m not an evil capitalist that believes farmers should be suppressed so that coffee roasters can make all the money from coffee. The only way the specialty market can possibly grow and succeed is via sustainable methods, rewarding coffee farmers for the hard work they put in. The current market situation (which has lasted for many, many, decades) is very much stacked against the coffee farmer and always has been. Anything that can redress this situation has to be a good thing. However, “fair trade” is not the only solution, and there are many ways this can be achieved in a just manner. “Fair trade” has been the focus of many positive articles (to the detriment of other approaches), so I hope this text will correct the balance a little, and highlight other ways that sustainability can be achieved.![Green Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/green-coffee1.BoA_rOXt_1THngI.webp)_Green Coffee_ The idea of a fair price for a farmer, so that he can have a degree of quality of life and a just reward for his efforts, is a very basic idea, and I struggle to think of a way any other model of supply can function and survive. For instance, in business, if a trader cannot cover costs, then it’s only a matter of time until the bank forecloses and the business is no more. This happens every day all around the world, but we need to look at why this happens. For example, the trader has a product no one will pay the wholesale price for, or, his product is not of a high enough quality to satisfy the marketplace. Now, comparing this to the coffee marketplace, for years coffee buyers were not interested in quality (and many of the big multi-national companies still aren’t) therefore buying was solely price-driven, which always leads to a drop in quality. The emergence, in the early nineteen-eighties, of the specialty market, consisting of small roasters selling a high-quality product, gave growers the chance to raise their standards, consequently raising the price of their coffee within the marketplace. Gourmet buyers will not buy poor quality. The coffee market has also long been a reactive market; when prices are high, every piece of available land has a coffee plant on it, but when prices are low farms disappear along with the coffee, this, in turn, raises prices as beans become scarce, resulting in re-planting (you get the picture). For a coffee plant to be suitable for harvesting requires around 4 years from seedling to mature plant. So it’s easy to see why the market fluctuates so much, as there is a four-year gap before changes are fully appreciated. The coffee-growing countries have tried and failed to work together, holding back crops to raise prices, but when harvests eventually hit the market a downturn in price always occurs. This leads to the whole boom and bust cycle that has been such a feature of the coffee market for many years. Fairtrade entered the market with very bold intentions in 1986. It was at a time when farmers were particularly down-trodden and suffering from very low prices. I’m sure in the early days there were people running the organisation allied to an admirable plan. But with success comes a degree of corporate characteristics, and the initial focus is often lost. Does the farmer need a full-page advertisement in the Sunday Times Magazine (which, trust me, is VERY expensive)? Does he need an army of administrative staff based in a swanky London office (or many other expensive cities around the world)? “Fairly traded” produce has the ability to sell itself on its own merit and doesn’t need all these things. The final thing that made me decide Fairtrade had lost its way was when, in 2002-2003, the Fair Trade organisation decided that, in order to sell more products, it needed to change the logo. Now, this in itself doesn’t sound that bad. Not until you look at the amount of money involved, which (I’m reliably informed by someone who worked very closely with Fair Trade) was in the region of one million pounds. Now not all, but a rather large chunk, was spent on advertising in the newspapers and magazines, and the rest on administration costs (letterheads, corporate image etc.). In my opinion, the new logo could have been introduced without publicity, or better yet, if the old logo had been kept, then the one million pounds could have been given directly to the farmers, either would have been a better way of spending such an amount of money. A recent article in the Spectator (5th November 2005) explains further. Calculating that, in general (and being generous), the fair trade farmer gets 12p extra for a Fairtrade pack of coffee, compared to a standard, commercial brand. However, the price on the pack in Sainsbury’s is around 75p more than their own brand offerings Resulting in a small reward for the farmer from the supermarkets, but a large return for the supermarkets hitting the guilt strings of its customers. Consequently, it is the very people that drive prices down on many items (to a degree that makes it difficult to make a decent living) who are making the consumer feel guilty, whilst increasing their profit margins? This is a perverse situation, to say the least. The Spectator article continues, discussing Percol, one of the “fair trade” pioneers. Brian Chapman is the sole owner of FoodBrand group limited, the owner of the Percol brand, and who made a name for himself, and his company, through the Fairtrade brand. A true story of taking on the big boys and becoming one himself, and lots of this is due to his determination to introduce “fair trade.” It is reported that he has paid himself between 1.5-2 million pounds over the last two years. Now, he is very much entitled to do this, and that is part of what running a successful business is all about. But I think it’s important to not become too self-righteous, believing that “fair trade” is the only way the farmer can get a good deal. When in reality some people in western countries are getting a much fairer deal from the Fairtrade brand than those for which it is intended. Something which amazes me is that the very people who created a need for “fair trade” (the big conglomerate roasters) are those who now use the brand as a stick with which to beat the consumer. Starbucks, for example, charge 10 times the amount they pay the farmer for their “fair trade” beans. They claim to be all about sustainability and partnerships, but only 1.6% of their total sales of coffee beans are “fair trade.” The Fairtrade brand is also used to further important public relations when the vast majority of output is the product of some of the cheapest, poorest quality, and most unfair treatment for farmers to be found. If these conglomerate roasters had not driven down the prices in the first place, then prices now would be much fairer and there would be no need for “fair trade.” The beans offered by Fairtrade are often far from being the best available (as an importer recently told me, they are sometimes, completely by accident, actually quite good, but rarely by design). So the roaster and the consumer pay a small premium (and indeed it is a very small premium, as the farmer only gets figures of little more than 1.26 USD a lb*1) for a lower quality cup. In recent months the New York Coffee Market price (this is the price that dictates the commercial-grade market) rose above that of the Fairtrade price, and many of the contracts were not honoured by farmers but sold on the open market instead. In contrast, one of my importers told me that, during this same period, none of his contracts were broken (as they were all above the market price and because these are relationships based on the quality which is worth more than mere USD). A product that has no quality checks at any point of the process, and demands a premium from the importer and consumer, is a strange concept for me, and I know of no other area where this happens. Rather than using a model based on the quality that warrants a premium according to its merits. I have seen this happen with the products that we sell. If something is good, people will pay (you only have to look at Hawaiian Kona and our cup of excellence coffees to appreciate the prices superior quality coffee can fetch). Fairtrade places in the consumer’s mind the idea that only coffees with the Fairtrade brand have been fairly traded. As a general rule, specialty coffee fetches a premium price within the marketplace, and as this premium is passed on to the farmer it is a good means of trading fairly, but without the ads and the offices. Relationships are built and maintained with quality importers. Cutting out the futures market can be one of the easiest ways to make sure the farmer and the roaster (and ultimately the consumer) both get a great deal. Paying the money directly to the farmer means everyone benefits. An issue recently brought to my attention by a member of the trade, is that the commodity markets are the seller’s and buyer’s last resort. Coffees that end up on the commodity market are the surplus of over-production, beans that just aren’t good enough to sell to the specialty market (believe me if they could, they would sell to the specialty market, as this can mean as much as double the price). Also, the market prices are set by those who buy many thousands and even hundreds of thousands of kilos at a time (again, this means the big roasters who use the Fairtrade brand for PR). The micro-roaster has no interest in these markets, which are home to the soulless banks and corporations whose only concern is profit. ### So what are the alternatives? “Cup Of Excellence” Has Bean are big supporters of the Cup of Excellence and these coffees command a real premium for quality (as much as 20 times the commercial-grade market price). It encourages the farmer to raise his standards and quality, in order to get a better price and provide the consumer with a better cup, it’s a win-win situation. Recently we paid a farmer USD16.30 a lb*1 for a “Cup of Excellence” coffee, when the market was at around USD1.15 a lb*1. So is our coffee Fairtrade? No. Is it “fairly traded” (ie. does everyone involved get a good deal)? Yes! These coffees go through a very specific selection process, blind cupped by farmers, to find the best offering to present to the international jury (all transparently audited to ensure no foul play. Then the world’s best cuppers are assembled at the origin where they spend a whole week evaluating the coffees and ranking them until only the very best are presented for auction. The other benefit of this approach is the opportunity for the roaster and farmer to come together, discuss the results and work together to find the best product for the consumer. This is a unique way of finding great coffee and building long-term relationships with roasters and farmers. The auction process allows truly great prices to be reached (again transparently monitored and audited to make sure no foul play goes on). ### “Relationship” coffees Importers deal directly with farmers or co-operatives in order to cut the whole ‘C’ market out of the money equation, resulting in specialty coffee prices. These coffees have to meet very strict quality guidelines (for which they are given training and are helped to obtain by the organisers of the relationship). This is important in order to guarantee that there is a direct connection between price and quality. ### “Speciality” Coffee This might seem strange, but ordinary specialty coffee already has a premium attached to it. It’s more of a gourmet item, so the farmer gets more in return; the importers and roasters are willing to pay more as the consumer is willing to pay a higher price for a gourmet product. We use importers who we trust, who have relationships with farms and farmers (I’ve been to cuppings where I have met the very farmers who were more than pleased to be involved in such a process). By working on a trust basis, I know that the whole chain is getting a fair deal. ### So in conclusion! Just because it doesn’t say “fair trade,” doesn’t mean it’s not fairly traded. It’s always worth asking your roaster their standpoint on price, their thoughts on sustainability, and their relationship with the importers and farmers. Don’t be fooled into believing that the only fair deals are done under the “Fairtrade” label. If you really want to take an interest in your coffee, make sure that the price you are paying represents a fair deal for all involved and helps to create a high quality, sustainable product. *1 FOB Prices_Disclaimer: Has Bean Coffee Limited does not warrant, guarantee, undertake, or make any representations regarding the accuracy, reliability, completeness, or correctness of this article.

Alexander Pope: > Coffee, which makes the politician wise, And see through all things with his half-shut eyes. Anne Morrow Lindbergh: > Good communication is as stimulating as black coffee, and just as hard to sleep after. T. S. Eliot: > I have measured out my life with coffee spoons.

Turkish proverb: > Black as hell, strong as death, sweet as love. Oliver Wendell Holmes, Sr.: > The morning cup of coffee has an exhiliration about it which the cheering influence of the afternoon or evening cup of tea cannot be expected to reproduce. Mark Twain: > After a few months’ acquaintance with European “coffee,” one’s mind weakens, and his faith with it, and he begins to wonder if the rich beverage of home, with its clotted layer of yellow cream on top of it, is not a mere dream after all, and a thing which never existed. Coleman Dowell: > It is extraordinary how the house and the simplest possessions of someone who has been left become so quickly sordid… . Even the stain on the coffee cup seems not coffee but the physical manifestation of one’s inner stain, the fatal blot that from the beginning had marked one for ultimate aloneness. Malcolm X: > It’s just like when you’ve got some coffee that’s too black, which means it’s too strong. What do you do? You integrate it with cream, you make it weak. But if you pour too much cream in it, you won’t even know you ever had coffee. It used to be hot, it becomes cool. It used to be strong, it becomes weak. It used to wake you up, now it puts you to sleep.![malcolm x](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/malcolm-x.DTmrNMrX_Z24p765.webp)_Malcom X_ Jean-Bertrand Aristide, Haitian President: > We shall prepare the coffee of reconciliation through the filter of justice. Through reconciliation, streams of tears will come to our eyes. Henri Poincare, “Science et Methode”: > For fifteen days I struggled to prove that no functions analogous to those I have since called Fuchsian functions could exist; I was then very ignorant. Every day I sat down at my work table where I spent an hour or two; I tried a great number of combinations and arrived at no result. One evening, contrary to my custom, I took black coffee; I could not go to sleep; ideas swarmed up in clouds; I sensed them clashing until, to put it so, a pair would hook together to form a stable combination. By morning I had established the existence of a class of Fuchsian functions, those derived from the hypergeometric series. I had only to write up the results which took me a few hours. Abraham Lincoln: > If this is coffee, please bring me some tea; but if this is tea, please bring me some coffee.

# Fearing Starbucks VIA Instant Coffee and My Solution [Brewing Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/brewing-coffee/)---by [Michael Allen Smith](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/michael-allen-smith/)![Fearing Starbucks VIA Instant Coffee and My Solution](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/fearing-starbucks-via-instant-coffee-and-my-solution/fearing-starbucks-via-instant-coffee.jpg) In February 2009, Starbucks launched its instant coffee called VIA. At that time, you could sign up to have a free sample mailed to you. Even though I [home roast coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/roasting-coffee-in-a-popcorn-popper/), I have always suspected making a decent instant coffee might be possible. However, I feared Starbucks would fumble the project. But I had to know, so I completed the form to receive my sample VIA. My free samples sat around my kitchen for months. Whenever I thought about trying them, I looked over at my outstanding coffee and couldn’t go through with it. _One day I would run out of the good stuff and then I would try the Starbucks VIA Instant Coffee._ That day never seemed to come because as soon as I’d run out of the good stuff, I’d head out and acquire more outstanding coffee. Would I ever try the VIA?![Starbucks VIA](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/starbucks-via-instant-coffee1.8AV-Whqb_Z1YWuMf.webp)_[starbucks via](http://www.flickr.com/photos/freakgirl/3421171862/) by Debbie R_ Then, I finally broke through my fear and tried the Colombian. I expected something horrific, but it wasn’t bad. It wasn’t good, either. It was OK. In other words, it exceeded my expectations. Would I ever buy (or take another free sample) while living in Seattle? Absolutely not. Would I consume a cup if I was in the middle of nowhere? Yes, I would. Although Starbucks did a commendable job with the Colombia, I still feared the _Italian Roast_ VIA sample. I’ll quit coffee before subjecting myself to that burnt blend. In September 2009, Starbucks had the official national rollout of the Starbucks VIA Instant Coffee. Starbucks pushed the story that this was the economical alternative to cafe coffee. From _Starbucks unveils its instant brew_ on CNN Money: > Via is sold in packs of three cup-sized servings for $2.95 or $9.95 for a 12 pack. That makes for a cost of $1 per cup, which is Starbucks’ cheapest option. This works out to between 82 and 98 cents a cup for bland coffee. Now, it is easy to beat this per-cup price via home roasting or even simple home brewing, but instant coffee shouldn’t be compared to the more labor-intensive methods of coffee preparation. People will drink instant coffee because it is portable and requires nothing more than hot water. To me, this sounds more like tea. Coffee drinkers will often give me a furled eyebrow when I mention my love for quality tea. Then, I logically explain to them that tea is very much like coffee. Bad tea and bad coffee are everywhere, but quality exists with both beverages. **Canned coffee and bagged tea are the evil offspring of the** _**good stuff**_.![Jo Sencha Green Tea](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/my-green-tea.DvxlwpiG_Zi3LtU.webp)_Jo Sencha Green Tea__My Jo Sencha tea came from Seattle’s Teacup. It cost $2.20 and held 3 steeps (73 cents per large mug). This is a high-quality Japanese green tea. Had I brewed it at home, the per-mug price would have been lower. Equipment required: a mug, a filter, and hot water._ So, before my fellow coffee drinkers rush to buy the Starbucks VIA, consider trying some quality tea. A portable filter costs about $10, and tea will keep for about 6 months. Tea, even excellent tea, is often less expensive than mediocre coffee. Most tea also holds up to multiple steeps. My solution is to keep quality coffee at home at all times. On those occasions when you travel and need to pack light, take some quality tea and a filter. You should be able to acquire hot water on the road. If you can’t, pack a kettle too. On really long trips into a hostile coffee territory, I could see bringing the Starbucks Colombia VIA. At home, never. ### Resources [The History of Instant Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/the-history-of-instant-coffee/) – INeedCoffee article covering the origins of instant coffee.

# Four Signs You’re in a Real Espresso Bar [Espresso](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/espresso/)---by [M Elias Keller](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/m-elias-keller/)![Four Signs You’re in a Real Espresso Bar](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/four-signs-youre-in-a-real-espresso-bar/4-signs-espresso-bar.jpg) Ever been in the mood for a good espresso – a real espresso – and then been massively disappointed in the undrinkable swill served up to you? We’ve all been there. But no longer. From bitter (ha) experience, I’ve established four simple signs that you’re in a real espresso bar. Of course, there are always occasional exceptions, but stick with these and your chances of not wasting time and money will tremendously improve. Here we go. ### #1 Only one size of espresso is served. The golden rule. If you see singles, doubles, triples, or (ugh) quad espressos offered – just walk away. Real espresso bars and baristas know that real espressos come in one size: double ristretto (but that rarely is and does not need to be indicated). Think of it like going to a wine bar. You don’t order a small or large wine – just a glass of wine. Same with espresso.![espresso-menu](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/espresso-menu1.GKg8u-KK_2vPYzE.webp)_Espresso Menu_### #2 The drink menu is small and simple. Coffee, Americano, latte, (traditional) macchiato, cappuccino, mocha, chai latte, or an espresso. That’s it. Sometimes a cafe will have fancy options like a cortado (smaller version of a latte) or a Gibraltar (espresso with a splash of steamed milk), but if they’re selling Almond Joy lattes, smoothies, or coffee milkshakes … no. Get Yelping. (It’s worth mentioning that some cafes with wretched espresso do a great cold brew.) ### #3 The food offerings are very limited. As in, little more than pastries and biscotti. Espresso quality in a cafe is inversely proportional to the number of food offerings. If you see a robust menu of sandwiches, wraps, salads, vegan food, and gluten-free treats baked right in the cafe – well, it’s all probably very tasty. But the espresso will be undrinkable. Why? Because doing espresso right takes focus and dedication, and cafes devoting significant time to food and snacks are unlikely to pull consistently great shots. Occasionally, you’ll find a real espresso bar that also imports a wide selection of food from a local eatery, but it’s the exception, not the rule.![espresso-and-sparkling-water](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/espresso-and-sparkling-water.W2v3mqhO_Zrblx8.webp)_Espresso and sparkling water_### #4 The baristas use tampers and their hands to pack and smooth the ground espresso beans. This shows they care about technique and craftsmanship. And of course, if the espresso isn’t served to you in a demitasse mug, on a saucer with a small spoon, and with a small glass of water – ah, my condolences. (Bonus points for baristas who serve espressos with sparkling water.) ### To recap One size espresso. Small menu. Not much food. Tampers and hands. Simple as that. And don’t be tempted by fanciful cupping notes or siren songs about the exotic countries the beans came from – it doesn’t always mean the cafe has the equipment or the baristas to pull real espressos. Just look for the four signs and avoid the bitter taste of _fauxpresso_ and wasted money.

# Frank Zappa: Coffee Achiever [Coffee People](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/coffee-people/)---by [Alex Scofield](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/alex-scofield/)![Frank Zappa: Coffee Achiever](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/frank-zappa-coffee-achiever/frank_zappa_coffee_achiever1.jpg) Interviewer: Is it possible to say where you get your musical influences from? Frank Zappa: Sometimes you get it from chicken. Sometimes from coffee. Any history buff can effortlessly rattle off a long list of figures who were, given the advantage of our hindsight, ahead of their time, and whose thoughts and accomplishments were not appreciated until long after their anonymous deaths. Frank Zappa is not one of these people. His first major-label album was released in 1966, and from then until his death in 1993, he enjoyed stretches of commercial and critical success. Still, his vibrant presence on the web roughly seven years after his death, as well as steadily enduring sales of his albums on their Rykodisc label reissues, indicate that the 21st century would have been more receptive to his music and thought than the world he left and the three preceding decades. His anti-genre musical eclecticism and maverick strain of libertarian politics would have been much more at home in the present than they were during his lifetime. Zappa had another attribute that would have fit in much better in the late ’90s and beginning of the 21st century: his coffee-drinking habits.![frank zappa coffee achiever](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/frank_zappa_coffee_achiever1.x32jN3eW_1Y8Hhn.webp)_The photo was taken in Frank Zappa’s home, in November 1988_ “To me, a cigarette is food,” said Zappa in his autobiography, The Real Frank Zappa Book. “I live my life smoking these things, and drinking the ‘black water’ in this cup here.” Alas, my friends, this is not INeedCigarettes.com – we shall concentrate on the latter of the two aforementioned vices. Many are ready to assume that Zappa followed the lead of the herd of fellow ’60s musicians in consuming a rich spectrum of drugs. His often trippy 1966 album Freak Out! was released a good year before the Beatles’ Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band set the industry standard for psychedelic rock. The bizarre lyrics and sometimes grotesque instrumental features on Freak Out! and subsequent albums led many a listener to believe that Zappa’s influences were chemical. However, Zappa’s eccentricities were not born of narcotic drugs; a Zappa feature in a 1976 ‘Suosikki’ Magazine article says it all: Q: Do you have a drug problem? A: Yes, with coffee. Q: With coffee??? A: I’m an absolutely sober person. I don’t consume alcohol. I don’t smoke weed. But I drink gallons of coffee. ### Coffee: A Driving Force Even without the specific references to coffee drinking, it is apparent in Zappa’s lifestyle and his art that coffee was a driving force. His approach to making music was not the erratic one we might expect from a rock musician. Rather, he played with the ethic of a genuine workaholic. Biographer/groupie/musician Nigey Lennon describes her baptism by dark roast in her book _Being Frank: My Time With Frank Zappa_. Upon her initiation into Zappa’s band, the Mothers of Invention, Lennon was permitted to play only after gulping down horrifyingly strong and dark coffee. When the rest of the Mothers had been similarly wired, the band was finally ready to begin its marathon jam sessions. “I work as many hours a day as I can physically stand to,” he said during an interview with Don Menn for Guitar Player magazine. “The average is about 15 now.” Little wonder that his fellow band members had to drink the most potent of coffee to keep up. ### The Hills Are Alive With the Sound of Coffee Zappa’s love for coffee was not bound to the rehearsal room, as he drank it on stage as well. Coffee even made it into the recording studio, often home to noise creations by Zappa that challenged conventional definitions of ‘music’. For a man who spent his life seeing, smelling, and tasting coffee, it makes sound sense that he would eventually want to hear it, too. “The other great noise was — there are two people in this group who play didgeridus,” Zappa recalled in an interview with Bob Menn in Best of Guitar Player. “One of them is the woman from Australia who is also the oboe player. And one afternoon, I imagined this awful sound that could be created if one were to take a didgeridu and play it into a partially filled coffee pot. And I asked her whether she would do it. She said yes, and let me say, it is truly nauseating. I was laughing so much I had to leave the room.” Overachieving, overreaching, and overworking, Frank Zappa’s approach to his work and art is reflected in the incessantly wired world of coffee drinking America.

# General Guide to Buying Coffee [Brewing Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/brewing-coffee/)---by [Maxwell Miller](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/maxwell-miller/)![General Guide to Buying Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/general-guide-to-buying-coffee/unroasted-coffee1.jpg) Although coffee is one of the most heavily consumed drinks on the earth, many people know generally little about what factors that can determine the difference between a great cup of coffee and a mediocre one. This guide will help clear up the basics of choosing and buying coffee. How is coffee bought on the Internet any different than the coffee at the grocery store two blocks away? There are many differences between the coffee bought online and the coffee bought at grocery stores. Generally, the grade of coffee bought online is higher than that at grocery stores, however, the most significant factor that separates grocery store coffee from that bought online is the freshness. ### Freshness Coffee degrades quickly after it has been roasted. The optimal time to drink coffee is 2-5 days after roasting, however, if coffee is stored right, the flavor will stay relatively well for almost two weeks. After three weeks the coffee flavor has been ruined for the most part. Therefore any coffee bought on a shelf, since it has probably been sitting there for weeks already, will usually have a poor flavor. No matter what kind of airtight containers the coffee is shipped in, after roasting the coffee flavor will degrade within a matter of weeks. ### Unroasted Unroasted coffee will stay very fresh for months, which is making it a great choice for those who are very serious about the coffee they drink. Since you can roast coffee in a variety of ways (including a [popcorn maker](https://ineedcoffee.com/roasting-coffee-in-a-popcorn-popper/)), many people have switched to buying unroasted coffee.![unroasted coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/unroasted-coffee1.CF8p3Tlu_ZwWuHo.webp)_2 pounds of unroasted coffee_### The Bitter Truth So last time I went down to the store and bought some nice fancy Kona coffee, however it tasted no better than the regular coffee I have been buying over the years. Coffee regulations in the United States only require manufacturers to specify that they are selling 100% coffee. This allows coffee manufacturers to blend 10% of an expensive type of Kona coffee with a much cheaper grade and advertise is it as Kona Coffee. This not only spoils the reputation of Kona coffee, but it is a very dishonest trick. Therefore when you buy international coffee, make sure they specify that it is 100% from the country and crop advertised. For more information on this point, read [Kona Coffee Confusion](https://ineedcoffee.com/kona-coffee-confusion/). ### Other Buying Tips - Exposure to oxygen ruins a coffee’s taste much quicker when the coffee is ground. Therefore we recommend that you either buy small quantities of ground coffee or buy whole bean coffee and ground your own. Try to only grind about as much as you are going to use to help keep your coffee tasting fresh. - Great coffee does not always cost a fortune. When searching for gourmet coffee, you will definitely come across specialty Kona blends or rare African coffees that will undoubtedly cost more than $30 a pound. Although this coffee is usually amazing coffee, there are many great coffees for 1/2 the price that tastes nearly as great as these high-dollar blends. The main reason for this specialty coffee costing so much is that it is usually from a very small region, and has a very popular name and reputation. There are many blends that are lesser-known, that have superb flavors themselves. Search around and don’t be afraid to try new coffee. - Buy from coffee shops. Although this seems like common sense, there are many people that buy coffee from shops online that also sell all sorts of goods from sporting goods and clothing. Buying from a coffee shop usually ensures that the people selling the product know a lot about coffee, as well as how to please the customer they are catering to. ### Beginner’s Guide to Unroasted Coffee Roasting one’s own unroasted coffee ensures not only the freshest coffee but the cheapest gourmet coffee available. Those who love the very expensive coffee should consider home-roasting, as unroasted coffee usually can cost as little as 1/2 the price of roasted coffee, which in a short time can pay off the initial cost of a coffee roaster. For those who have never tried it, it usually will cost around 130-165$ for a roaster that will do all work for you, which is normally what you should start with. Some roasting experts use stovetop popcorn makers or other similar devices, however, they are not recommended unless you know what you are doing, for you can easily ruin the coffee. It usually takes about 1/2 hour to roast enough for several pots of coffee, so it is not a terribly time-consuming process. ### The Tastes of the World International regions tend to share similar tastes, aromas, and other characteristics. I will classify the major regions into four groups: Central America, South America, Africa, and Indonesia. ### Central America Central American coffees are generally light-bodied (the body refers to the thickness or feeling in the mouth). These coffees actually feel ‘lighter’ in your mouth than the heavier Indonesian coffees. They are usually said to have a crisp or bold taste, which refers to the somewhat sharp punch of Central American coffees and relatively high acidity. Some examples or highlights include: - Costa Rica Reserve Coffee - Jamaican Blue Mountain ‘Wallenford Estate’ - Mexican ‘Spirit of the Aztec’ Coffee ### South America A close relative (literally and figuratively) to Central America, our South American countries tend to have slightly heavier bodies than Central American coffee, with slightly peculiar aromas and overtones. They share the same crips bold taste, and generally still share the high acidity. Some examples or highlights include: - Colombia Supremo Coffee - Brazil Santos Coffee - Bolivia Colonial Caranavi Organic Coffee ### Africa The origin place of all coffee, Africa has unique coffee with sweet, fruity, spicy, and exotic flavors. This coffee is often sought by coffee experts due to its unique aromas and overtones, however, those new to flavors may find some of them odd-tasting. The only way to really get a feel of them is to try them, and some examples or highlights include: - Ethiopian Yirgacheffe Coffee - Kenya AA Coffee - Zambia Terranova Estate Coffee ### Indonesia Indonesian coffee has a long finish, a very heavy body, full flavor, and low acidity. There is not much gourmet coffee produced in that area; the coffee grown there is highly prized for its taste and smooth finish. Although gourmet beans are rare, this coffee usually remains at a relatively low price due to its low popularity. - (Indonesia) Sumatra Mandheling Coffee - (Indonesia) Sumatra Dark Roast ‘Black Satin’ Coffee - Yemen ‘Arabian Mocca’ Coffee Published on June 1, 2005--- #### Maxwell Miller Maxwell Miller is the founder of Gourmet Coffee Supplier.

# Coffee Gator Kettle and Carafe Review [Brewing Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/brewing-coffee/)---by [Chris Arnold](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/chris-arnold/)![Coffee Gator Kettle and Carafe Review](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/gator-coffee-kettle-carafe-review/DSC01527.jpg) I have several standalone pour-over cone coffee drippers, but the Coffee Gator is a little different in that it comes with a matched glass carafe and a stainless steel reusable cone filter. Strangely enough, I don’t have a proper kettle, so I am looking forward to using the Coffee Gator stainless steel kettle with a built-in thermometer, which takes the guesswork out of getting the proper temp. I will review these items together since they complement each other well.![Gator Carafe and Kettle](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/DSC01527-650x431.YXBs-zPi_1OFFuP.webp) ### Coffee Gator Kettle The stainless steel kettle is very well made and holds 1 liter (32 ounces) of water. The lid has a built-in thermometer with a nice colored indicator for the optimum temp range of 195F-205F. The spout is long and nicely shaped, and the handle is comfortable. Since you cannot put metal in the microwave, you can heat water in the Coffee Gator Kettle directly on a stove (Gas, Electric, Induction, or Halogen are fine according to the manufacturer). Or you can heat it in a separate electric kettle as I did, and then pour it into the Gator and put the lid on. For my first couple of tries, I put water that I thought was hot enough, but the temp gauge told me it wasn’t so. It seems to work best when the water gets to a rolling boil for a while before transferring to the Coffee Gator. Another reason why that temp gauge is so useful.![Gator Kettle and Carafe](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/DSC01529-650x516.DYNk7hoC_Z28Tnhw.webp) ### Coffee Gator Carafe The glass carafe is nicely shaped, and the top section is designed to hold the included stainless steel cone filter perfectly. It holds 300 ML (10 ounces) of coffee and does not have a handle. Instead, it provides a piece of rubber insulation that provides a cool spot to hold on to. The stainless steel cone has a little tab handle which makes inserting and removing it easy. Cleanup is very easy, just a few seconds under running water. ### Usage of the Kettle and Carafe together I filled the cone up about halfway with [medium grind](https://ineedcoffee.com/coffee-grind-chart/) Ethiopian Harrar coffee and heated some water in a glass pitcher in the microwave until it came to a rolling boil for about 30 seconds. I then transferred the boiling water to the kettle and waited for the thermometer to indicate the proper temperature of about 200F.![Gator Carafe](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/2016-05-16-05.58.42-650x649.Bae0HLoi_1yGMzA.webp)![Gator Kettle](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/2016-05-16-06.03.41-650x488.CrsbmBt0_ZBlm2m.webp) As I began to pour water over the coffee, I found the kettle spout provided very precise pinpoint control, which was refreshing. The resulting coffee was very nice, if a little light. I felt the extraction time could have been a little longer, so I tried again with a finer grind. The finer grind did improve the extraction time and taste, and the amount of silt at the bottom of the cup was minimal, but this is expected with any metal filter. I would love to see a future cone filter option where the flow can be adjusted or stopped altogether, similar to the [Clever Coffee Dripper](https://ineedcoffee.com/clever-coffee-dripper-review/).![Gator Carafe](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/2016-05-16-06.04.00-650x627.CoXJ3KgP_Z1fUzHb.webp)![Gator Carafe](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/2016-05-16-06.07.36-650x459.DoyrKZ1X_Z1Ung8h.webp) ### Conclusion I really like the kettle, especially the built-in temp gauge in the lid. The precise spout also improved over the makeshift pitchers I had been using that this will become my go-to for anything pour-over. The coffee carafe also produced a tasty cup of coffee, but I would probably opt for one of the larger ones also made by Coffee Gator, which come in 450 ML and 900 ML sizes and are nearly the same price. These larger units also provide a traditional handle. If you are tired of not knowing the temp of your water or buying paper filters, the Coffee Gator Carafe at about $25 USD and the Kettle at about $40 USD are well-made products that don’t break the bank and produce great results._Disclosure: INeedCoffee was sent this product at no cost, which did not affect its review._ Published on May 23, 2016--- #### Chris Arnold Chris is the creator of Two Bit History.

# Franz Kafka: Coffee Achiever? [Coffee People](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/coffee-people/)---by [Alex Scofield](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/alex-scofield/)![Franz Kafka: Coffee Achiever?](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/franz-kafka-coffee-achiever/kafka-book1.jpg) Prague cafe culture was a pivotal element of Kafka’s life and an inspiration to his writing. The characters in his novels and short stories are often coffee drinkers. Kafka’s writing often instills in the reader a jumpy and jittery feeling of having drunk one coffee too many. So what were Kafka’s coffee preferences? Did he take it with cream and/or sugar? Unfortunately, the answer to this question remains elusive. Max Brod, Kafka’s friend, editor, and biographer, often describes Prague’s cafes but never mentions Kafka actually drinking coffee in **Franz Kafka: A biography**. As fused as Kafka’s name is with coffee culture, after several weeks of reading online and hard-copy biographies of Kafka, I can only venture an educated guess as to whether he drank our favorite beverage.![kafka book](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/kafka-book1.C8JcJB___ZMokVv.webp)_Franz Kafka by Max Brod_### A Steady Diet of Coffee? Kafka’s dietary habits were a source of some concern for Brod., who says: > Franz’s attitude to the ‘natural health methods’ and reform movements of a similar nature was one of very intense interest… . He always wore light clothing, even in winter, went for long periods without eating meat, and drank no alcohol. Coffee is not mentioned here one way or the other, but given his aversion to other vices, coffee may well have been something else he avoided. Kafka’s acquaintance Rudolf Fuchs draws close to the issue without directly answering it, recalling: > One hot afternoon I was accompanying [Kafka] through the old Eisen street. I stopped at a coffee stall and drank a lemonade, after first wiping the rim of the glass with my hand. Kafka watched me disapprovingly. ‘That won’t help you,’ he said. While Prague holds an allure to the literati and coffee connoisseurs worldwide, Kafka felt confined and limited by his home city, and dreamed of quitting his government job and moving to Berlin. Late in his life, he finally made this dream a reality, but his timing could hardly have been worse, for both personal and historical reasons. His health began to fail rapidly, and Berlin underwent a postwar period of hyperinflation and scarcity. Kafka enlisted the help of his family to send provisions from Prague to his Berlin neighbors suffering the most during these depressing times. And while Kafka’s family consistently obliged, Kafka found these charitable offerings somewhat depressing. > There [a parcel] lay in front of us, deadly serious, without the faintest smile in the shape of a slab of chocolate, an apple, or something of that sort, as much as to say, ‘Now live a few days longer on groats, rice, flour, sugar and coffee, then die as best you can, we can’t do any more for you. Coffee, apparently, was not viewed as a luxury by Kafka at this time, but rather as a grim necessity. ### A Coffee-Rich Atmosphere Whatever revulsion he would later feel towards coffee, Kafka seemed very comfortable in a coffeehouse atmosphere earlier in his life. Whether or not he was a coffee drinker, Kafka was a perfect embodiment of the Bohemian artist who gives coffeehouses an aura of intellect and artistry. Indeed, Kafka was in his element in Prague’s cafe culture, an environment that brought out the best in one of the century’s greatest writers. Many of Kafka’s readers assume the man embodied the gloom and paranoia that permeate so much of his writing. But Brod, who knew as well as anybody, assures us otherwise. > One felt well when one was with him, the richness of his thoughts, which he generally uttered in a cheerful tone, made him, to put it on the lowest level, one of the most amusing of men I ever met, in spite of his shyness, in spite of his quietness…[H]e liked a good, hearty laugh, and knew how to make his friends laugh too. Marilyn Bender describes the personable and cafe-hopping Kafka in **Franz Kafka’s Prague: A Literary Walking Tour**. > He made loyal friends in the Prague Circle of German-acculturated artists and intellectuals who hung out mainly in cafes and coffeehouses, and he enjoyed the city’s leisure attractions from theater to sports. It was in the Prague cafe culture that Kafka experienced something of a religious awakening to his Jewish heritage. Brod says: > I, for example, was a frequent member of the audience of the performances in the Cafe Savoy, and learned a lot there towards appreciating Jewish folklore. But Franz, after the first time I took him there, entered into the atmosphere completely. It was the same intense and creatively fruitful dogged determination with which he himself did everything. Kafka tended to hold his own writing to impossibly high standards, and while the world would eventually grow to appreciate the greatness of his novels and short stories, Kafka rarely felt satisfied with his literary work. But in Prague’s cafe society, Kafka seemed to be most at ease in presenting his works. “At Baum’s, he read ‘**The Verdict**‘ to us and had tears in his eyes,” says Brod. “‘The indubitability of the story is confirmed.’ Those are strong words of self-conviction, rare enough in the case of Franz.” In a similar vein, Bender mentions, “On the second floor of the Cafe [Grand Hotel Europa] in December 1912, Kafka read his newly composed **The Judgment** to an appreciative audience[.]” Whether or not Kafka succumbed to the temptation to drink coffee, a coffeehouse atmosphere seems to have done wonders for his sense of self-confidence and appreciation for his own writing. ### A Literary Coffee Aroma At the very least, coffee plays a cameo role in several of Kafka’s more prominent works. A faint coffee aroma wafts through **The Trial**, and indeed, coffee is one of the first things that protagonist Joseph K. loses during the course of his trial. Two warders surprise K. at his home one morning, inform him that he is under arrest, and intercept K.’s breakfast from the maid. “‘That’s so, you can believe that,’” said [warder] Franz, not raising to his lips the coffee cup he held in his hand, but instead giving K. a long, apparently significant, yet incomprehensible look. Without wishing it K. found himself decoyed into an exchange of speaking looks with Franz, none the less he tapped his papers and repeated: ‘Here are my identification papers.’” When Joseph K. finally does get to drink coffee, his lot is no better than it was during his early exchange with the warders. He is entirely preoccupied with his trial and the mysterious charges against him, and when talking to his maid, inadvertently makes her cry. “He contented himself with drinking his coffee and leaving Frau Grubach to feel that her presence was burdensome,” wrote Kafka. Hot coffee is now cold comfort to K., who is able to eat his breakfast but is being further drawn into the ominous mechanism of his judgment. In Kafka’s novel **Amerika**, the main character Karl meets a student who works at a store throughout the day and goes to school through the night. “Oh sleep!” said the student. “I’ll get some sleep when I’m finished with my studies. I keep myself going on black coffee. A fine thing black coffee.” “I don’t like black coffee,” said Karl. “I don’t either,” said the student laughing. “But what could I do without it? If it weren’t for black coffee Monty wouldn’t keep me for a minute. I simply don’t know how I would get on in the shop if I didn’t have a big bottle like this under the counter, for I’ve never dared to risk stopping the coffee-drinking[.]” Kafka never visited the United States, but from this scene in **Amerika**, it is clear that Kafka foresaw an All-American type of student, a workaholic, and a caffeine-driven busybody. The student drinks the coffee not for the love of it, but as a drug to keep himself fueled in a 24/7 cycle of activity. A 21st-century U.S. university campus, with a top-notch coffee vendor and students caffeinated into the wee hours of the morning, would probably not surprise Kafka. ### Conclusion Kafka was neither achiever nor a slacker during his lifetime; rather, he was somehow both rolled into one. He embodies the idea of the coffeehouse literary giant because so much of his social world and his writing inspiration are grounded in the cafes of Prague. His characters could, on occasion, show a taste for coffee that foreshadowed the traits of real-world coffee drinkers decades later. And even though I am unable to ascertain whether coffee actually touched his lips, INeedCoffee salutes Franz Kafka as a coffee achiever.

# French Press Review – Small Farms Collective [Brewing Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/brewing-coffee/)---by [Michael Allen Smith](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/michael-allen-smith/)![French Press Review – Small Farms Collective](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/french-press-review-small-farms-collective/french-press-review.jpg) In this article, I’ll show you how to make French Press coffee while discussing the French Press Coffee Maker by Small Farms Collective.![french press small farms collective](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/small-farms-french-press.DBkCK4pG_85OQS.webp) *French Press Coffee Maker 32 ounces by Small Farms Collective *### Inside the Box The French Press Coffee Maker from Small Farms Collective comes with an extra filter, a coffee scoop, a wooden paddle for stirring the coffee, and, of course, the French Press itself. This French Press is made of glass with a metal frame. The footer of the French Press does a nice job of supporting the glass. I usually prefer plastic bases because some other French Press models that use a metal frame footer can be unstable when you go to press down on the French Press, especially if you either added too much coffee or the grind was too fine. This footer was stable, which is good.![scoop coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/scoop-coffee.CZl4fH3Z_1L155D.webp) A scoop is included if you don’t want to weigh your coffee. Use one scoop of coffee for every 4 ounces of water. If you are interested in learning more about weighing coffee for the French Press, read [French Press Coffee Tutorial](https://ineedcoffee.com/press-pot-tutorial/) for more information. ### #1 Add Coffee I used eight scoops of coffee and 32 ounces of water for this brew. As with any French Press, the grind is coarse. You can see what that means on our [Coffee Grind Chart](https://ineedcoffee.com/coffee-grind-chart/).![add ground coffee to french press](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/french-press-add-coffee.BLcjiKud_2cAjbi.webp) ### #2 Add Hot Water Using a kettle, add hot water to the French Press. I set my Bonavita kettle to 202°F. If you don’t have a kettle that lets you dial in the temperature, boil the water and then let it sit for 20 seconds or so before adding it to the coffee. Adding boiling water directly to coffee will extract some unpleasant flavors, which we want to avoid. Add 4 ounces of hot water for every scoop of coffee you added. ### #3 Stir When you use fresh coffee, often there will be grounds trapped at the top that are not in contact with the hot water. These grounds are not getting extracted. The trick is gently stirring them into the coffee without agitating the brew too much. A spoon does the job, but Small Farms Collective made something better—a wooden paddle. The paddle did a better job stirring than anything I’ve used before. After using this paddle, I can’t return to using a spoon or a chopstick.![wooden paddle french press](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/stir-french-press.BG0kWhsl_Z1UJ4Rp.webp)_The wooden paddle does a great job of breaking up “the foam” at the top of the French Press._### #4 Steep For 3-4 Minutes The French Press is considered a full-immersion coffee brewer, as the coffee and the hot water are in contact throughout the entire brew cycle. Compare that to the pour-over or drip method, whereby the water passes through the ground coffee during the brew cycle. The result is a richer body. Adjust the steep time to match how strong you like your coffee. ### #5 Press and Serve The last step is to press the plunger slowly down inside the French Press and serve. ### ![french press finished](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/french-press-finished.DcnTEW9z_1tEWoA.webp) ### Summary The French Press Coffee Maker by Small Farms Collective is a good budget glass French Press. The footer was solid, and I like the wooden paddle that ships with the brewer. The filter did an OK (not perfect) job of keeping loose grounds out of the bottom of my mug. If having a super clean cup is important to you, look into the French Press Tabletop by Planetary Design. But for a glass French Press, the amount of coffee sediment was equal to that of other glass models. Small Farms Collective has made a good budget glass French Press that would be a good first French Press for any coffee fan. ### Resources [French Press Tabletop Coffee and Tea Maker with Bru Stop Technology Review](https://ineedcoffee.com/table-top-press-pot-review/) – French Press Review [Buying a French Press – Picking the Right One](https://ineedcoffee.com/buying-a-french-press-picking-the-right-one/) – INeedCoffee guide.

# Fundamentals of Coffee Business Success [Coffee Business](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/coffee-business/)---by [Andrew Hetzel](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/andrew-hetzel/)![Fundamentals of Coffee Business Success](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/fundamentals-of-coffee-business-success/fundamentals-of-coffee-business.jpg) The retail specialty coffee industry is unique in that it attracts as many admirers of the product – coffee fanatics – as it does those who are looking for a lucrative business investment, probably more. It is human nature to focus on those things that are of greatest personal interest to us, and in the case of the coffee fanatic that is all things coffee! So, for the good of your business, I ask you to put down that glossy espresso machine product brochure and step away from those roasted coffee samples and the tiny single-serving bottles of flavoring syrups. Let’s spend the next few moments talking about something even more important than the product, the critical business issues that will define your retail coffee business – I promise that it will be worth your time and that you can go back to the taste testing when we’re done. A word of caution: this document is not intended to be a paint-by-numbers template to start a coffee shop. If you are one of the millions of proudly self-professed “Dummies” that requires a handbook in order to start your coffee business or learn Microsoft Windows, you had better stop reading now. There are plenty of books that cater to the DIY market segment of this industry; we aimed to do something a little different here – something a little more thought-provoking for those preparing to make a serious financial or emotional investment.![French Press Coffee Tasting](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/3-french-press1.B17Nz2EV_Z19pyBz.webp)_French Press Coffee Tasting_ With alarming frequency, my associates and I respond to questions from new and prospective coffee shop owners, such as, “what sugar-free syrup tastes best?” or “should I pick the San Macaroni 5-group espresso machine or the La Spaghetti?” New entrants to the retail coffee industry tend to focus a large portion of their valuable time and resources on coffee shop gear, products, logo colors, and other minutiae that may affect the style or identity of a business, but in fact, do not define that business and are probably not the factors that will lead to its eventual success or failure; whereas it may be nice and even helpful to know which synthetic concoction gives your calorie counting and diabetic consumers the best sense of real chocolate in their cafe latte, the resulting drain of your time away from the real issues may commit your new coffee shop to failure, even before your shiny new La Spaghetti is out of the packing crate. If you have already started your new shop and recognize the example questions above as being yours, don’t worry, it’s never too late to start fixing the items addressed within this document. For all others that may be considering starting a new coffee shop but have not yet taken action, we hope that the ideas listed herein will be helpful to give you some insightful reflection on the true issues that will impact your business so that you may continue to pursue your goals with a newfound sense of confidence. ### Is Starting a Coffee Shop Right for You? Owning your own coffee business has mass appeal. Picture yourself as the proprietor of a successful coffee shop and just think of the many positive attributes that you associate with that image: freedom to make your own decisions, financial independence, respect from the local community, your family and staff, and the satisfaction of providing a sought-after product to your customers in a social environment that brings people together, just to name a few. Just smell that fresh coffee brewing! What could be better? Let’s add a shot of reality to that idealized image for a more grounded perspective: picture working 14-hour days, 6 or 7 days a week, smell the unrelenting pungent scent of stale coffee on your clothing and in your hair, feel that painful steam wand burn on your index finger, see yourself driving to your shop at 5:30 am on a dark and cold Saturday morning when an employee calls in sick (again), imagine yourself pacifying the argumentative customer who insists a traditional Italian macchiato includes caramel, “like Starbucks does.” Oh no, what have I gotten myself into? Surprisingly, many prospective coffee entrepreneurs feel that an undefined “something better” awaits them in the retail coffee business than in their current life, but do not necessarily stop to validate this point. Take inventory of both the benefits and drawbacks of retail business ownership prior to making a serious life change. Immerse yourself into the industry before you make your leap. Interact with coffee shop owners in neighboring cities; join the Specialty Coffee Association of America and attend their annual conference; visit the online chat forums at the SCAA website, coffeeforums.com, and CoffeeGeek.com; read Roast Magazine, Tea & Coffee Trade Journal, and Fresh Cup Magazine. Take inventory of both the benefits and drawbacks of retail business ownership prior to making this serious life change. Before you commit yourself to that new reality, make sure that you are basing your decision on facts and not solely on your desires and a well-intentioned misinterpretation of the facts – accept that there is a difference between what happens and what you want to happen. Every garage band from Seattle or Portland has the dream of a rock star lifestyle; a disciplined few practice their instruments the 4 to 6 hours each day necessary to be good musicians; the fewer still that become famous will understand that practicing 4 to 6 hours each day is part of the real rock star lifestyle – you had better enjoy it. ### Develop Your Business Plan and Define Your Goals Would you get in your car and begin driving to a business meeting without first knowing 1) who you are meeting 2) where they are 3) how to get there and 4) why you are going to this meeting in the first place? The same should be true in starting your new business. Without a careful definition of what you hope to accomplish by starting your new business, it is highly unlikely that you will reach your goals; even if you were to reach those goals, you may never even know. Even where financial motives are not your sole intent, be aware that there is some reason that you are starting a retail coffee shop instead of, say, a bed & breakfast or graphics design firm, or even staying at your current dead-end job. Define what it is that you hope to achieve, and how you intend to achieve it; even though you will encounter unexpected roadblocks along the way, you will always have your destination in mind and be able to find another route. The best way to do this is by carefully developing your business plan. By now, you may have heard that you will need one and may have even started developing one. For those who have: congratulations! You have taken the first steps to define your business. Many people view the business plan as a necessary document that you will need in order to obtain a loan, secure investors, or in many cases, lease commercial property: those people are half right. The full truth is that your business plan is more than a document, it’s an exercise designed to help you organize your ideas and communicate them effectively to any affiliated party, but the most important reader is you. Sure, you can purchase a ready-made plan from any of a thousand sources these days: online from various websites, your local bookstore, and even your office supply warehouse – it is our recommendation that you do not do this, or at least use these store-bought term papers as an example of what can be accomplished and how rather than what you should write. Someone else’s term paper may a shortcut to getting the grade that you want, but remember, this is your business and you will need to run it; wouldn’t you rather be armed with the experience of understanding how and why your concept and supporting data was created? Use the resources available through the Small Business Administration and the assistance of the Service Corps of Retired Executives, and when you need guidance specific to the retail coffee industry, call on your new friends that you have met through SCAA events, online forums, cooperative owners of neighboring businesses or the experience of a business consultant to assist you. After all of the work that you have devoted to creating the vision of your new business, you may find this next piece of information upsetting: you’re not done. In fact, **you will never be finished with the business plan**. Rather than lock the original document away in a tomb or time capsule over which future generations will marvel with wonder, keep it up-to-date with current events and refer to it quarterly to stay focused and on goal. The very best business plans that have been written are still being written and will continue to be updated to meet the changing goals of its authors, changes to the business, and the conditions that affect that business. Remember who is the real audience of this exercise; the only person that you ultimately impress or disappoint is you. ### Plan Your Startup and Operating Budgets Wisely By this point, you may have noticed that the title of this document may very well have been “top reasons that coffee businesses fail,” had it been written from a different perspective. This same theme rings true with our #3 entry: Plan Your Startup and Operating Budgets Wisely, or essentially, have enough capital. Starting any new retail coffee business is neither easy nor inexpensive, and as the old adage implies it does take money to make money. But what is enough? According to the Small Business Administration, 50% of small businesses fail in the first three to five years. Studies show that the top two reasons for failure are management inexperience and insufficient capital. As you consider your budget planning portion of your business plan, it is reasonable that you should expect that your required opening bankroll or credit access will total in the hundreds of thousands of dollars rather than tens for the model “average” coffee shop in America today; just how much will depend on you and your plans. The actual value will vary greatly from business to business and will be affected by the scope and complexity of your intentions, local market conditions, as well as, your access to resources that others may need to contract separately, and vice versa. While determining the capital equipment portion of your budget, be mindful of the role that each of these tools plays in allowing you to generate your revenue and assign them an appropriate level of priority. Prioritizing the importance of tools in your shop will help to make those detailed purchase decisions easier in the future (is it really such a good idea to purchase your espresso machine, the primary income-producing tool of your business, second hand on eBay?), as well as, acting as a solid indicator of which items should be included in your operating budget for routine maintenance expenses. If you are not experienced in developing a budget, there are many resources available at your disposal as were mentioned in the category of immersing yourself in the industry. However, when you prepare your budget, we recommend that you be conservative with your income projections and generous with your expenses. By having enough cash on-hand to not only meet your initial capital expenses but also your complete operating expenses for a minimum period of one year, you will maximize your chances of success during the formative stages of your business; any less and you will not be giving you or your business the full opportunity it may need to establish itself in the community. In the event that you make the determination that your available funds are well below your reasonable expectations of what will be necessary to succeed, by all means, find another source of funding or quit while you are ahead. Entering into a business venture that is undercapitalized greatly increases the chances that the business will fail. Sure, there is always a chance that you will “get lucky” and everyone has his or her own tolerance for risk, but such ventures are invariably some type of investment in either your spiritual or financial advancement – a smart investor knows how to manage risk. ### Choose Your Location Based on Value, Not Price As the term value implies, you should not only search for a location taking into consideration the costs that you will pay but also what you receive in return for that cost.**Pop Quiz** Which of the following locations makes more money? 1. 1,500 Sq. Ft @ $10 Sq. Ft location that attracts 150 customers daily; or 2. $20 Sq. Ft location of the same size that attracts 300 customers daily; or 3. Both make the same amount. Pencils down! (Sorry, got a little carried away there). If you said “B,” you’re right – very right. In this scenario, that extra $1,500 you commit to paying each month generates approximately $13,000 in additional gross income (after the cost of goods sold!) each month at reasonable coffee shop product prices and conservative profit margins (~65%). Even if that higher customer volume requires more staff hours and other increased demands such as electricity and water, the vast majority of that $13,000 will end up in your pocket at the end of the month: that’s good value for your investment dollar. So how exactly are you supposed to estimate the number of customers that may visit your business? Some traditional texts estimate that the average retail coffee shop is frequented by .2% to 1% of proximate vehicle traffic (higher for pedestrian traffic). As the law of averages goes, this estimate is pretty reasonable. For the best accuracy, you will need to take make adjustments accounting for local area demographics, visibility of the location, traffic patterns (in addition to volumes), accessibility, and competition – this is best done with the assistance of a professional. If you have nearby competitors, it is always a good idea to take a seat in their shop or parking lot and count the volume of customers they serve at varying times of the day and days of the week. We recommend that rather than take the best guess on any single number you should create projections for conservative (low customer volume), moderate (reasonable volume), and aggressive (high customer volume) scenarios. Develop your response to each of these situations and be prepared to act; you will find that the stress and uncertainty often associated with the financial planning of a new business will be significantly reduced when you have a pre-developed response policy that is understood and ready to execute. ### Know Your Coffee and Espresso Before starting any business, it is advisable that you fully understand (and ideally, enjoy) the product that you intend to offer. The specialty coffee industry has enjoyed such stellar growth in modern times and received so much positive publicity, that sometimes the one thing that the new coffee shop owner seems to overlook is, well, the coffee! Coffee, you say? What could be so difficult to understand about making coffee: it’s a bean, grind it, mix it with hot water and you’ve got a high margin drink… right? Well, perhaps, but only in the sense that wine is “old grape juice in a bottle.” The danger in the specialty coffee industry is that most people do not realize that coffee and its resulting beverages exhibit a similar level of complexity as is found in fine wines, cheeses, olive oils, kinds of vinegar, and foods; interestingly, many experts in the coffee field have interests in these other areas. Take, for example, water: water is over 98% of the coffee that you will serve. It is shocking to us how many new coffee shop owners give little or no thought to their water source, specifically, the current and optimal levels of total dissolved solids, mineral hardness, alkalinity (pH), silica, iron, and chlorine in their water. Imbalanced water will completely alter the flavor of any coffee or tea and can destroy valuable equipment. When you truly understand coffee, you will recognize all of the elements that are part of coffee and of the beverages that you will serve and give them the due attention that is required. Just as if you were starting a winery or fine dining restaurant, you should strive to gain a level of competency with coffee such that you have the ability to not only create standard traditional beverages correctly but can build and abstract upon those recipes and preparation techniques to create signature beverages that will be the unique hallmark of your brand. We recommend that you start with the basics. Although it would be nice to travel around the country or around the world to sample the best that this industry has to offer, it is not necessary. As suggested back in step #1, immersing yourself in the local and regional coffee culture is a great way to quickly educate yourself on what coffee is truly intended to be; attend conferences, sign up for educational classes or events offered by any of a number of outstanding local artisan coffee roasters around the country. Be sure to sample as many different variations as you can as there is a great deal of personal interpretation that goes into drink preparation; do not base your business solely on the offerings of a major chain shop in your region -you have the ability to do better. ### Know Your Market Know Your Customers A clear definition of your intended customer type(s) must be known in order for you to effectively design many aspects of your business, from your product, your marketing campaigns, and interior designs to the strategies you will use to combat competitors. The more you know about the people who will walk into your shop and use your product, the more effective your efforts will be in attracting and retaining repeat business. Ask yourself: who is (are) the customer(s) for my business? Yes, we realize that these are coffee drinkers, but what else do we know about these people? What is their background? Are they on their way to or from work? School? An attraction or event? How old are they and what are their tastes in style, food, and music? What are social issues of particular concern to these people? Tailoring your business model to the most likely sources of local business is a smart approach. Consider the coffee shop at the base of an office building with steady pedestrian traffic of white-collar workers: understanding the approximate demographic, traffic patterns, and interests of these people will allow you to creatively apply ideas to your business (perhaps, a meeting area for private conferences away from the workplace) and products (such as quick lunch snacks for the captive in-house audience or office bundle packages of to-go brewed coffee) that will help to ingrain your business as part of the office culture. This approach would be similar, with entirely different results, in a location that is, for example, directly across from a high school or college or a drive-thru along a busy interstate highway. A targeted understanding of your intended consumer will also help you to effectively market your business in those places and use the methods of communication that will be most effective; for example, direct mail to a surrounding residential community may not be effective in areas where the majority of your intended consumers are commuters from elsewhere – it is always more cost-effective to take a finely targeted approach to reach your individual market segments (no matter how many there may be) rather than the “shotgun” approach of throwing out a broader and weaker message to a wide audience. ### Know your Competition Do you think that your only competitor is that big-name coffee chain store around the corner? Think again. Your competition is everywhere around you and in places that you may not expect, from the local restaurant, fast food business, movie theater concession stand, convenience store, ice cream parlor, mega-retailer, gas station, and even your consumer’s own home! With all of the potential competition from sources of coffee and other beverages like sodas and ice cream frozen drinks, it is very important that you project a consistent image meeting the needs of your identified target consumer. Objectively review every possible outlet for coffee and competing products within a geographic territory that is appropriate for your region (including but not necessarily limited to sodas as there are regional variations of competing products) meeting each of the standards of performance that will define your business in the eyes of the public, namely: - **The convenience of a coffee shop location** – How easy is your product to access? Are there barriers that would prevent a consumer from visiting the coffee shop, such as an inconvenient unprotected left turn from his or her normal morning commute? Also in this category, consider the standard of “speed of service” (which is sometimes separated into its own category). We believe that there is an appropriate expected speed of service defined for each type of coffee shop location, differing greatly from a sit-down retail location to a drive-thru. Be sure that the speed of service does not present an inconvenient obstacle for the customer. - **Consistency of the experience** – This is arguably the most important of the four criteria identified here and the central foundation of any brand. Studies have shown repeatedly that consumers prefer a product that is known to be “acceptable” rather than risks an unknown product that may be either “exceptional” or “poor”; more than anything else, a customer wants to know what to expect from a coffee shop. The anxiety generated by an inconsistent experience (product & service) may be enough by itself for a consumer to avoid a coffee shop altogether. - **Quality of the beverage** – This criterion is regularly grouped with the term “value,” but we suggest that you be careful not to do this and instead focus solely on the resulting taste. Identifying the true quality of the resulting beverage will allow you to establish an objective review of your beverages versus your competition and then educate your patrons accordingly to accurately recognize not only “what” identifies a quality specialty coffee beverage, but “why” it is that way. Taste is subjective and each individual will prefer different styles of drink, roasts, and varietals or blends of coffee; however, we find that even the uneducated palate will prefer a better quality beverage even if they cannot explain why. With a product as complicated as coffee, it is sometimes difficult to separate real value from what is the “perceived value” or the value associated with what uneducated customers assume is associated with a product, normally resulting from marketing techniques (this coffee is very expensive, so it must be good!); we suggest that you cut through all of that and first identify the true quality of your own product and that of your competitors, then build a marketing and price strategy to optimize the perceived value of the product. - **Cleanliness of your coffee shop** – This is the most simple criteria to judge and subsequently maintain to excel beyond your competition. Regardless of whether a business is geared to an informal crowd of bikers and teenagers or pinstripe gray-suited diplomats, everyone prefers a clean environment. Remember that cleanliness does not sacrifice your ability to personalize your space or inhibit free expression; never confuse a clean environment with a sterile one. For each of these criteria, outline all of the potential target customer demographics that are shared between your business and your competition to gain an objective overview of where the market potential exists either in a new market niche left open by gaps in competitor performance or in direct competition with an existing supplier. ### Invest in Your Barista Your employees are the face and best representatives of your business; they will interact with your customers, prepare your beverages and monitor the safety and well-being of your investment. There are several workforce models that may be applicable to your business, ranging from the food service model of unskilled workers hired at low wages to “press the buttons” to the fine dining model of premium customer service personnel akin to a tuxedo-clad Maître and skilled artisan Baristas manning your espresso machine, much like an award-winning chef in the kitchen; there is a situation that is appropriate for each kind of approach. It is not our intent to argue the effectiveness of any model with this recommendation to invest in your employees – it is our intent to recommend that with any model, you should choose the best possible candidates for their position and compensate them accordingly. The best approach in any situation is to hire the best people and give them the training, support, and compensation (monetary or otherwise) that they need to be comfortable and grow with their position. Thousand percent employee turnover rates may be common in minimum wage fast-food restaurants but consider what real cost this has on the small retail business: product inconsistencies resulting from inexperienced staff, exorbitant recurring training costs for all of the new hires, poor employee morale resulting from low wages and the personalities that low wages attract and most importantly, how these staff members interact with your regular customers – generally not well, and those that are able to develop a customer rapport are not likely to remain with your business for long as better paying opportunities to develop elsewhere. Technology tools are available to reduce the skill level required of your people to perform their jobs – take, for example, super-automatic espresso machines that perform all of the steps of a trained Barista, from grinding the whole bean coffee to extracting the espresso shots and even dispensing frothed milk, all at the press of a single button. As helpful as these devices may be, we caution you to use technology as a tool and not a crutch; whereas technology is helpful to assist your employees, not all problems can be solved with the application of technology alone in the name of cost savings. We recommend by attracting enthusiastic potential employees with stable job histories and good references looking for a long-term position you may spend more out-of-pocket in the short term, but that the returns you receive in reliable job performance, increased sales, and decreased training costs will far outweigh the upfront investment. Stable candidates are generally influenced not solely by monetary compensation, but also through the sort of support workplace that fosters advancement and other benefits, such as medical insurance coverage; be certain to work with your payroll professional or human resources leasing company in order to develop a packaged offering that reflects the type of candidates that you wish to have representing you and your business. ### Pay Yourself First Very often, individuals and even partners starting a new coffee shop leave stable long-term employment with predictable salaries in unrelated fields to become their own boss. It is tempting for the new owner acting in favor of their new business to reinvest 100% of all available capital, including their own salaries back into the fledgling business. Even though this concept is well intended, we recommend that you will be doing your business a greater service by ensuring that your own personal financial worries are set aside when you come to work. Drawing at least a minimal salary for yourself that satisfies you and your family’s basic needs will ultimately be far better not only for you but also for your business. By paying yourself a salary – even when times are tight – you will retain the ability to make smart business decisions in the true best interest of your business, rather than fold to the pressures of short-term hardships under the stress of immediate personal financial concerns. All of us have been in the situation of regretting a decision that seemed to satisfy our urgent immediate needs, but may have sacrificed some benefit for our future; in the context of your business, having a clear head, free of personal financial worries can help you to avoid financially damaging or potentially fatal mistakes. For many good reasons that you should discuss with your licensed attorney and accountant, every retail coffee shop should be established as its own legal entity separate and distinct from you. The coffee shop may be yours, but it is not you – this may seem obvious and even comically unnecessary at a first glance, but trust us that this distinction can be lost by the best and brightest working under extreme stress for long hours in the sole and total pursuit of a goal. Never lose sight of the fact that the business is a vehicle intended to reward you for your acceptance of financial risk and your intelligent hard work. Even in the event, you are independently wealthy or otherwise comfortable with your own personal financial wants, consider paying yourself a minimum wage for the hours you work in order to create the mental separation between owner and business. Have fun with your coffee shop, design it, manage it and personalize it as your own – just be careful to not lose your identity to the business, as this will only create problems for you and inhibit your ability to make potentially difficult but necessary decisions for the good of both owner and business. ### Have an Exit Strategy Planning how you intend to leave is as important as planning to start. Consider where you want to be in 5, 10, and even 20 years: how do you see yourself and your business changing in that time? What will your role be in that business? Do you really want to be the 70-year-old behind the counter serving drinks at an owner-operated coffee shop? Maybe you do, which is just fine. Give serious consideration to how you will be involved in the future of your business and for how long, we recommend developing an exit strategy that will allow you to leave before you have to leave. Popular exit strategies include planning to sell the business in part or whole to an unrelated party or a business partner, aggressive expansion whether by franchising, private capital investment, or public offering, leaving the business as an inheritance to provide for your children or the inevitable default method for inaction, death. Be mindful of the fact that the preferred timing and method of exit will vary greatly for each person; whereas some coffee shop owners enjoy the secure routine of personally managing their business 6-7 days a week, others may prefer to leave that task to others and search for new location opportunities, new business challenges (perhaps wholesale coffee roasting) or something entirely unrelated to coffee that poses a new and exciting entrepreneurial challenge. Be aware of which personality type yours is and plan ahead accordingly with the advice of your attorney and accountant. The plans you make now for your eventual departure from the business will dramatically affect the convenience of your departure, whether for you or your heirs.![white coffee shop new](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/coffee-shop-tim-wright.DintDYje_Z1ehAvD.webp)_Photo by_ [_Tim Wright_](https://web.archive.org/web/20180911013254/https://unsplash.com/@timdwright) ### Choose Good Business Advisors I am sorry to disappoint any readers that may expect this is the section where we recommend that you hire Cafemakers to help you with all of your needs – it is not and we are not. This is, however, the section in which we strongly recommend that you seek outside advice in any area that may not be your field of expertise, including but not limited to: business management, human resources & training, negotiation, insurance, real estate, accounting, interior design, and legal matters, to name a few in no particular order of priority. In short, there is someone out there that has learned from the mistake you are about to make – taking advantage of that information can mean the difference between your success and a costly failure. Although the consequences are less extreme in the case of a business advisor, interior designer, or trainer versus, for example, your attorney, the independent ability of an outside professional to remove themselves from the emotional haze of a complicated situation and help you take sound action in your best interest, which is generally well worth the investment. Even if training or accounting happens to be the specialty of your current profession, it can certainly not hurt to learn from and improve upon the experiences of others in that field as it pertains to this new venture. Ironically, people tend to seek outside counsel most often in those areas in which they are already familiar and have come to respect the complexity of the discipline – the same attention should be paid to the areas you are unfamiliar with; never assume that an unfamiliar topic lacks complexity as it is usually the extreme opposite. Be certain to place emphasis on the expert guidance for: - **Legal advice:** and I cannot stress this matter too greatly, engage a qualified and licensed attorney to assist you in all matters relating to the formation of your business, developing and protecting your brand, and major commitments, such as, leasing property or equipment and in any conflict that creates potential liability for you and your business interests. Never depend on your “best guess” or the collaborative responses of coffee shop owners to a free public bulletin board service regarding legal issues. Failure to correctly prepare or defend yourself in many aspects of business represents a credible threat to your livelihood – choose your attorney or attorneys with care; ideally, ones focused on the area of practice directly related to your immediate concern. For example, you will likely find that you will need a different attorney for matters of intellectual property, such as, applying for or defending a trademark that you would for the organization of your company structure or defense of a slip and fall lawsuit. - **Accounting:** You need only look as far as recent headlines on the collapse of Enron, MCI WorldCom, and others to understand the importance that the role of accounting plays in modern business. The recording and interpretation of your accounting data by Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) is not only a good idea to understand the true state of your financial well-being, but it will also help you to avoid the sort of accounting irregularities that may put you in jail. Fun Accounting Fact: Did you know that despite years of notoriety, it was a conviction on the criminal charge of tax evasion that eventually put infamous mobster Al Capone in Federal prison? True. A skilled accountant can advise you on the best way to legally make the best use of your income and expenses, take advantage of tax breaks and incentives, as well as plan strategies for long-term financial goals. Bookkeeping may not seem to be a very thrilling task and is considered by many to be an afterthought or necessary evil of doing business, but never forget: in business, the way you report your financial information is nearly as important as the financial information itself. - **Insurance:** Work with your business insurance advisor to determine what types of coverage are applicable to you and your business. Just like you, we are not fond of the underlying argument “I’ll bet you $500 that our business burns to the ground this year,” but nevertheless, in the event that the unthinkable happens, that policy will be the best investment that you ever make, with premiums amounting a small fraction of the cost of recovery from that disaster – just think, you could be one of the “lucky ones” that get most of their money back and has an opportunity to start again. Beyond physical damage to property, be ever mindful of the potential liability that exists in this litigious American society – like it or not, simply letting your customers in the front door may make you responsible for their negligent and irresponsible behavior (not to mention that of your employees). As the owner or a partner in your business, also do not forget to protect yourself, your partners or investors, and your family. What would happen to each of you in the event that you are permanently disabled or even killed? A wide variety of insurance products exists today that is designed to protect all of the above so that an unfortunate event for you or your company does not become the final event. Despite the best assurances and intentions of your friends, neighbors, and customers, they cannot protect you as your attorney, accountant, and insurance agent can in times of dire need. It does not go far enough to say that your paid advisors are some of your best allies in business; they are your ONLY allies in business. ### Document Everything A complete and easy-to-understand set of plans for your business is the underlying foundation of a consistent customer experience. Maintaining a clear and concise written set of your business-specific operating procedures is helpful to train new employees, setting guidelines that maintain consistency among your entire workforce, and will also produce a template that will allow you to duplicate your success and expand your brand to new locations. Your operating procedures are the valuable intellectual property of your business; they define everything from how to greet a customer and the number of espresso shots in a 12 oz cappuccino to your nightly cleaning chores. The more detail that is described in each step of your processes and procedures, the less flexibility remains unclear and open to interpretation by your management and employees; resulting in fewer deviations from the intended experience. Develop both an employee training manual that includes step-by-step instructions for the actions that must be taken by your employees as they perform their jobs and a separate managers’ guide that includes additional detail and other management functions, such as hiring or discharging new employees. As an interesting side effect of this process is that you will learn more about your business; you do not really know what is “missing” from your procedures until you attempt to document them as a stand-alone text. Once all of your procedures have been recorded, do not simply lock them away in a vault to act as a time capsule for some future civilization to discover; return to them regularly and make updates that reflect changes in menus, new tasks, or the other new things that you have learned to make your business better. If your plans are to someday license or franchise your concept to others or even to start a new location elsewhere, these documents will be the essential starting blueprints that will save you time and money. ### Strive for Continuous Improvement One comment that we have heard regularly from those luminaries of the coffee industry that have been at the top of their profession for 20+ years is that there is always something new to learn about coffee. We suggest that if you run out of new ideas or are unable to otherwise some way to improve yourself or your business that it may be best to move on to something new. This is a suggestion that we not only recommend for our clients but a pledge that we fully intend to honor ourselves. Consider the Japanese principles of Kaizen, a philosophy of management dedicated to continuous improvement, which is largely credited with the success of Japan’s competitive position in the world market. Kaizen, coming from the words “renew the heart and make it good,” means improvement – improvement not only in the bottom line financial health of a company but also the small improvements in home life, social life, and working life. Alone, these gains may seem small and insignificant, but over time total up to big gains in your performance, personal satisfaction, and quality of life. It’s the little things that are necessary to add up to big things. Not surprisingly, it is those companies that are most actively involved in performance improving events, organizations, and seminars that not only have the best-tasting beverages but also have the most dramatic financial successes. It is not solely a coffee shop’s participation in organizations like the Specialty Coffee Association, World Barista Championships, the Barista Guild, and others that make a company successful; rather, we believe it is the type of company that actively pursues its own improvement that sees these associations as opportunities for the company and employee betterment – the companies that seek these opportunities are the ones we find to be most successful in business. Make the quest for continuous small improvements in knowledge and performance part of your company culture rather than focusing solely on your profit and loss statement. Not only will you find your business to be a more enjoyable and rewarding adventure, but also will be more likely to find the financial success that you seek – in that environment, everyone wins. ### Resources Specialty Coffee Association – Formerly the SCAA (Specialty Coffee Association of America) [World Barista Championships](https://wcc.coffee/) – official site_Coffee in Montreal photo by [Luke Chesser](https://unsplash.com/@lukechesser)_ Published on March 1, 2007--- #### Andrew Hetzel Andrew Hetzel is the Founder of Cafemakers, a specialty coffee business consultancy based in Hawaii.

# Good To the Last Drip: Part 1 [Brewing Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/brewing-coffee/)---by [Ryan Jacobs](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/ryan-jacobs/)![Good To the Last Drip: Part 1](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/good-to-the-last-drip-part-1/bonavita-coffee-brewer400.jpg) Coffee purists will argue that the drip maker doesn’t offer enough control over the finished product. However, the ease of use and cleanup make auto-drip a very popular brewing method. The focus of this article is to discuss the basic principles needed to prepare a good cup of coffee so you can relate this to making great auto-drip coffee. Brewing coffee relies on some basic premises which should be taken seriously when discovering how to make great coffee. These are standards that have been arrived at and agreed upon through many years of research, trial and error, and many failed cups of coffee. The information that I am divulging did not come from my own private lab but has been passed on from countless others who have paved the way for the rest of us. I can say that I have validated the results. To get quality brewed coffee, of course, you should be using quality roasted coffee that is fresh and properly ground. Even the best coffee machine on the market won’t make your stale Folgers taste like anything but stale Folgers.![](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/bonavita-coffee-brewer400.nxwuRLsb_2fBuBg.webp)_Bonavita Carafe Coffee Brewer_ The basic principles that need to be maintained to achieve properly brewed coffee are: 1. Clean Water 2. Proper Water Temperature 3. Proper Extraction Time 4. Proper Grind and Dosage ### Clean Water Using clean water will make a huge difference in the overall taste of your brewed coffee. It will also help you achieve consistent coffee. Having ‘off-flavors from tap water such as chlorine, iron or other minerals in your water will taint your perception of the brewed product. Since purified water has no taste or odor to begin with, it can pass no taste or odor onto your coffee. This is the best way to be able to taste your coffee in all of its intended glory. In addition to making better quality coffee, purified water has benefits for your equipment as well. Lime deposits that normally form from the continual use of unfiltered coffee will not have a chance to form in your equipment. For more information on this and cleaning your coffee equipment, read the article [Keeping Your Coffee Equipment Clean](https://ineedcoffee.com/keep-your-coffee-equipment-clean/). To get clean water you can either buy distilled water at the store or use a water filtering device. Some of the newer automatic drip coffee makers have filters built-in with replacement filters easily available. ### Water Temperature Water temperature is crucial to the proper extraction of the flavor molecules from the ground coffee. The recommended brewing temperature of coffee is 95-98 C. The sad truth is that many of the coffee makers on the market don’t come close to reaching the appropriate temperature right out of the box. Furthermore, if you don’t keep your equipment clean and it has formed mineral deposits inside, this will prevent the water from heating appropriately. ### Proper Extraction Time Extraction time is almost trivial if the brewing temperature is correct. If the brewing temperature is hot enough, then the simple force of gravity will force water to drip out at just about the right rate. However, due to differences in basket design, some makers produce coffee that is over-extracted. What this means is that the hot water has had too much exposure time to the coffee and is beginning to extract unpleasant flavors into the brewed beverage. Coffee should be brewed hotly and fairly quickly. For example, a 10-cup pot of coffee should take between 3 and 4 minutes to brew. Now that we have discussed the important factors in preparing good drip coffee, we shall focus on which coffee makers work best for each situation and then develop a composite of what might be the best coffee maker for you. ### Proper Grind and Dosage I only mention this in this article because it is an important factor in the outcome of your finished product. It does not necessarily have anything to do with your coffee maker. People always ask how strong they should brew the coffee and the answer is simple: whatever tastes right to you. A good starting point is 1 Tbsp. per 6 oz water. The grind of your coffee should not be as fine as espresso or as coarse as French Press. If in doubt, ask your local roaster to grind it for you. [Coffee Grind Chart](https://ineedcoffee.com/coffee-grind-chart/) ### Conclusion As I mentioned before, these practices will not turn Folgers into Starbucks. However, even inferior coffee has a better chance of achieving greatness if these methods are followed. In [Good To the Last Drip: Part 2](https://ineedcoffee.com/good-to-the-last-drip-part-2/ "read Part 2"), I will discuss how to apply this knowledge to shop for an Automatic Drip coffee maker that can best help you.

# Genetic Testing for the Health Conscious Coffee Drinker [Coffee and Health](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/coffee-health/)---by [Michael Allen Smith](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/michael-allen-smith/) If you read my article [5 Coffee News Stories That I Never Want To Read About Ever Again](https://ineedcoffee.com/5-coffee-news-stories-that-i-never-want-to-read-about-ever-again/), you already know that I am tired of hearing about the health benefits of coffee. My main complaint is that we all respond differently to coffee, and that our response to coffee can change as we get older. What is observed with most people in a health study may have no relevance to you as an individual. The only data that matters is your own. For the past two years, I have tracked my daily coffee consumption and sleep quality score. I outlined this project in the article The Quantified Coffee Drinker, but I wanted more data. I wanted to learn if I was genetically predisposed to certain chronic illnesses. I also wanted to learn more about how my body metabolizes caffeine and if I could determine how healthy coffee was for me based on my genetics. So, I ordered a genetic test from 23andMe. Years ago, this would have cost thousands of dollars and taken months to analyze. Today, you get a test for $99 plus shipping and will have your results in about 8 weeks. ### Do the Healthy Benefits of Coffee Apply to You? According to a WebMD article _titled “Health Benefits of Coffee” by Jonathan L Gelfand, MD, coffee has been reported to help with the most common conditions:_ Type 2 Diabetes, Heart Disease, Parkinson’s, and Alzheimer’s. Instead of jumping into the strengths or weaknesses of the studies used, I’d like to propose an alternate way for coffee drinkers to assess how much coffee helps or doesn’t help them prevent these serious health problems. If a coffee drinker had an elevated risk for an outcome that could be helped by coffee, continuing to drink or even drinking more might be a wise path. However, if a coffee drinker is not genetically predisposed to an illness that coffee consumption is to provide benefit, then assuming coffee yields an additional protective shield may be a false assumption. Lastly, if one’s genes signal issues with coffee consumption, then reducing or eliminating coffee might produce the best health outcome. ### My 23andMe Data The vast amount of data _23andMe_ collects is amazing. For this article, I will focus on the data related to coffee. For a more detailed review of the service, check out my personal blog post, [23andMe Results](https://criticalmas.org/2013/04/23andme-results/). I wanted to know if I was at risk for any of the chronic illnesses that coffee has been reported to help lower the risk for. Here is my data. Condition My Risk Typical Risk Score Coronary Heart Disease 36.8% 46.8% Decreased Risk Type 2 Diabetes 16.8% 25.7% Decreased Risk Alzheimer’s Disease 4.9% 7.2% Decreased Risk Parkinson’s Disease 1.9% 1.6% Typical Risk My genetic data shows me that I am not at an increased risk for the ailments that coffee is reported to show benefits for. Now, will drinking coffee lower my risk even more? We don’t know. The health studies I’ve read do not break this information down. My interpretation of this information is that since my risk level is not elevated for these four conditions, the need to consume coffee to lower my risk factor would have far less benefit than someone genetically predisposed. ### Caffeine Metabolism Going back to my original statement, we all respond differently to caffeine. There is a genotype that can predict how well you can metabolize caffeine. From the _23andMe_ website: > Caffeine is primarily metabolized by the liver enzyme cytochrome P450 1A2 (CYP1A2). The form of the SNP rs762551 a person has determines how fast CYP1A2 metabolizes caffeine. In this study, **people with the slower version of the CYP1A2 enzyme who also drank at least two to three cups of coffee per day had a significantly increased risk of a non-fatal heart attack.** The study found that fast metabolizers, on the other hand, may have actually reduced their heart attack risk by drinking coffee. Am I a fast or slow metabolizer of caffeine?![23-caffeine](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/23-caffeine.LJCw7gWX_Z2cHbex.webp)_I am a slow metabolizer of caffeine._ As a slow metabolizer of caffeine, my risk of heart attack is significantly greater when drinking two or more cups of coffee per day. That isn’t good. ### Is Coffee Healthy For Me? This test told me that I shouldn’t be overly worried about the ailments that coffee is supposedly protective against because my risk factor is either already decreased or typical of the average population. It also told me how my body processes caffeine might make two or more cups of coffee bad for me. The sweet spot for my coffee intake might be one cup a day. I hope you remember this article the next time someone shares a link about how wonderfully healthy coffee is. Coffee can be healthy for some and bad news for others. We are all different. The only data that matters is our own. Since getting my results, I have gradually reduced my daily consumption to 2 cups of coffee. In addition to having my genetic test, I have been tracking my coffee intake and sleep quality for over two years. I have found that I start to feel worse when my coffee levels are too high (3 or more cups a day) for a few weeks. If you are a health-conscious coffee drinker and are interested in determining the optimal amount of coffee, I recommend the _23andMe_ test. ### References [23andMe Results](https://criticalmas.org/2013/04/23andme-results/) – Personal blog post reviewing my results of the _23andMe_ test.

# Good To the Last Drip: Part 2 [Brewing Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/brewing-coffee/)---by [Ryan Jacobs](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/ryan-jacobs/)![Good To the Last Drip: Part 2](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/good-to-the-last-drip-part-2/cone-coffee-filter.jpg) In the [first part](https://ineedcoffee.com/good-to-the-last-drip-part-1/) of this series, I discussed the basic principles needed to make a good cup of coffee. In this portion, I will be talking about the things to consider when making an auto-drip maker purchase. Many of the machines that you will find in the stores look highly efficient. Some of them have a grinder, espresso maker, and a drip-maker all rolled into one convenient device which will save money and counter space. DO NOT BE FOOLED. Remember, machines are mechanical and will thus wear out over time. The problem with machines that do many things is that one part will wear out before another does. It is very rare that the whole machine will fail at the same time. Supposing your coffee maker has a grinder and an auto-drip maker, what happens if the grinder fails? Do you buy a new grinder? If you do, then the machine that once saved you counter space is now taking up more space than it would have if you bought them separately in the first place! So-called ‘deals’ like this are usually put together using inferior components together under the disguise of a good deal. You deserve better. Each component you purchase to make coffee should be specifically designed for that purpose and not thrown together in a haphazard manner. Not only does this save you trouble in the long run, but it also allows you to upgrade individual components as you see fit. If you suddenly believe you have a need for a $100+ grinder, then you can do so and not leave behind a useless grinder attached to your drip pot. The bottom line is that you should keep machines separate. ### Filter Basket Designs There are two basic designs when it comes to the filter basket. The first is the basic flat basket filter, which is probably the most commonly used. The other is the cone-shaped filter. This is a relatively new design. As for which one you should look for, it is up to you, but I will recommend that a cone-shaped filter is better designed for overall extraction and purpose.![cone coffee filter](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/cone-coffee-filter.zbewuuo-_11dFWy.webp)_Coffee Cone Filter_### Cone Coffee Filter The flat basket type filter has one basic design flaw — it is completely flat, and there is but one tiny hole in the center of the basket that the coffee is supposed to drain through. Roofs are angled, swimming pool drains have a depression directing water flow, and bathtubs are slightly angled toward the drain. Why filter baskets are designed contrary to this is beyond me. The real problem: poor extraction and the dreaded “plugged” filter effect. This is where the coffee can’t drain as fast as the hot water is entering the basket and as a result, hot coffee sludge comes pouring out of the basket sending grounds into the carafe and all over the countertop. It is a horrible experience indeed and one to be avoided at all costs. In addition to better drainage, the cone filter offers better extraction. Since all the water is angled toward a common point, the oils and flavor are extracted more evenly than in the flat basket approach. Krups, Braun, Capresso, Melitta, and many others favor the cone filter while Mr. Coffee, Bunn, and others choose the flat basket approach. Go for the cone unless you can afford a Bunn. ### Filter Type You’ve been reading INeedCoffee for a while now, and you are familiar with the debates over the effects of drinking paper-filtered coffee vs. the gold filter method. What are you to do? The decisions you make about your health are up to you. Assuming taste is the focus, however, there are a couple of other considerations worth mentioning.**Gold filter advantages:**1. **Reusable.** I have had a gold filter going on for 7 years now. That is quite a long lifespan and it shows no sign of dying anytime soon. Initially, this is more expensive, but you will both save money and save on the waste you contribute to landfills. 2. **Richer taste.** Since there is no paper in which to trap oils, these flavorful oils will find their way into your cup. The result is a richer taste than you will get when using paper filters.**Paper filter advantages:**1. **Smoother taste.** While the gold filter allows oils into your cup, it also allows tiny bits of ground coffee to flow through as well. A paper filter won’t do this. 2. **Easier cleanup.** A gold filter requires that you now have one more piece of equipment that you will need to keep meticulously clean. With paper, you can just toss the whole thing into the trash or compost bin. ### The Coffee Maker Grid The following grid is not all-encompassing but lists several of the more commonly available auto-drip maker choices that are available. My recommendation is to create a grid-like this while doing your shopping and make the comparisons for yourself. Use this merely as a starting point. Machine Water Filter Available? Water Temp (1-10) Price Range USD Cone or Flat Filter Mr. Coffee No 6.5 $10-20 Flat Basket Krups Yes 9.5 $30-50 Cone Braun FlavorSelect Yes 9 $20-40 Cone Filter Bunn Home No 10 $30-100 Flat Basket ### Conclusion Hopefully, this guide will be useful in choosing a good coffee maker for you. By learning the principles involved in making great coffee, you should be able to ask better questions of your salesperson when making your purchase. And if, after extensive searching, you find that the perfect machine has yet to be invented — create it. People will come.

# Our Guide to Coffee Mail Order Subscriptions [Coffee Business](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/coffee-business/)---by [Michael Allen Smith](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/michael-allen-smith/)![Our Guide to Coffee Mail Order Subscriptions](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/guide-coffee-mail-order-subscriptions/mail-order-coffee-guide.jpg) There are countless options when it comes to buying a coffee mail-order subscription. In this post, I will list a few coffee roasters that excel at roasting coffee and operating a subscription service. I will also provide some tips to help you find other roasters should the ones listed below not meet your needs. A good coffee subscription needs to, first and foremost, be an excellent roaster. Then, the coffee roaster needs a secure web server with easy-to-configure subscription options. I want to be able to control the following options: - Roast level - Origins or blends - Grind size (if needed) - Quantity per shipment - Frequency of shipping - Duration of subscription Surprisingly, not all quality coffee roasters have this figured out. ### Tips for Finding a Good Coffee Roaster Subscription Online I’ve been using the following tips for years and never ordered a coffee I didn’t enjoy. #### #1 Find the Best Coffee Roasters When I want to try out new coffee roasters, I first visit [Coffee Review](https://www.coffeereview.com/). Unlike the coffee reviews you see on blogs, which tend to be overly kind, Coffee Review follows a strict coffee-tasting protocol. Coffee roasters submit their coffees, and the best ones get their reviews shared on the site. Coffee Review is an amazing resource. When you get to Coffee Review, skim the reviews at first. You don’t want to fall in love with a coffee or roaster yet because there is a decent chance that, although they do an excellent job roasting coffee, they can’t run a secure website. Jot down a few roaster names before we go to the next step. The only downside to this advice will be for readers outside the United States. Coffee Review mostly reviews coffee from roasters in North America. Another way to find excellent regional roasters is to search Google or Bing with the keyword Sprudge. Sprudge is a top resource for discovering new coffee roasters and cafes. _Example: “ [sprudge Los Angeles](https://www.google.com/search?q=sprudge+los+angeles&#x26;rlz=1C1CHBF_enUS714US715&#x26;oq=sprudge+los+angeles&#x26;aqs=chrome..69i57j69i64.5365j0j7&#x26;sourceid=chrome&#x26;ie=UTF-8)“._#### #2 Is the Roaster’s Website Secure? A secure website will only be accessible via HTTPS and have a lock.![secure coffee website ineedcoffee https ssl](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/https-secure-website-lock.CRLkw18B_Z2akWUs.webp) Some websites have half their site unsecured and then process the order checkout on a secure server. I would advise against shopping with these roasters or any business that leaves half their site unsecured. Besides being sloppy, there are too many cases where your name and address are passed unsecured to the order processing system. Your credit card will be fine, but you shouldn’t be forced to enter any personal info, be it a name, address, or email, on an insecure website to complete an order. There are also cases where the main site is secure, and the store section isn’t. As you navigate from the home page to checkout, keep your eye on the corner of your browser to confirm the server is still secure.![coffee secure site](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/temple-coffee-secure.Q2TH_k8y_2m62C1.webp)![insecure coffee site](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/temple-coffee-insecure.CFiOyqtE_26Hh0G.webp)_This is unfortunate, as Temple is a great coffee roaster._  There is no reason for the customer not to have their entire shopping experience on a secure server today. Another clue to look for on the website is whether the current year is displayed in the footer. That is an indicator that the site is more likely to be maintained. All software requires periodic updates. As a customer, you cannot know if they are maintaining their ordering system, but you can peek at the footer.![2017 blue bottle](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/blue-bottle-footer.hVuHUnZM_2mQv1L.webp)![staufs 2007 footer](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/staufs-coffee-footer.DqdDWGcM_ZawqNu.webp)_I took these screenshots on June 21, 2017. One is updated, and one is a decade old. Which ordering system will you trust your credit card with more?_#### #3 Review the Offerings and Shopping Cart Options Our list is probably pretty small now, so picking a roaster for your coffee mail-order subscription will be easier. My advice now would be to search for what is most important to you. For me, it will be a combination of available varieties and prices. I prefer single-origin coffee over blends and lighter to medium roasts over dark. Also, keep an eye out for the size. **Not every bag of coffee is 12 or 16 ounces.** At the time of this writing, Coava Coffee out of Portland sells bags of coffee for $15. But those bags are just 250 grams. That is less than 9 ounces! Meanwhile, Water Avenue Coffee is selling its 12-ounce Roaster Choice bags for $15 a few blocks away. Both are equally great roasters, but at the same price, I’ll take the extra 3 ounces of coffee with Water Avenue. ### Some Picks For Coffee Mail Order Subscriptions If you don’t want to do the research described above, here are a few excellent coffee roasters. Your entire shopping experience will be secure. #### #1 Blue Bottle Coffee – Oakland, CA Blue Bottle Coffee has one of the best online coffee ordering systems, and its coffee is also outstanding. I had their Single Origin coffee subscription for a year, and I loved every bag I received. Inside the box, they will include a card about the coffee. Blue Bottle has created a 10-question quiz to help guide you to a coffee you like. - Blue Bottle Coffee #### #2 Paradise Coffee Roasters – Ramsey, MN I found Paradise Coffee several years ago when I was a more active home coffee roaster. I started buying their green coffee beans and then their roasts. For years, Paradise Coffee has received outstanding scores on Coffee Review for their single-origin offerings and some of their espresso blends. Paradise Coffee is also taking the lead on seeking specialty robusta coffee, which you will hear more about in the coming years. - [Paradise Coffee Roasters](https://paradiseroasters.com/) #### #3 Atlas Coffee Club – Austin, TX Atlas Coffee Club uses a travel theme to provide Single-origin coffees worldwide. Each coffee is shipped with a postcard from the region. Their subscription checkout allows you to customize the number of bags, how often you will receive the shipment, roast level preference, and grind size from a single easy-to-follow screen. I had three of their coffees and enjoyed them all. The Colombian was great on the AeroPress, and the Ethiopian made an excellent cold brew.![Atlas Coffee Club Subscription](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/atlas-coffee-club.B6xpCkIA_yWsQQ.webp) - [Atlas Coffee Club](https://atlascoffeeclub.com/) #### #4 Bows & Arrows Coffee, Victoria BC I wanted to include an option for our readers in Canada since shipping across borders can be expensive. When I visited Victoria in 2013, I was amazed by the excellent coffee from Bows & Arrows. Since then, I’ve had their coffee several times in cafes here in Seattle. - Bows & Arrows Coffee ### How Fresh is Mail Order Coffee? All the roasters mentioned in this article have ordering systems that ensure the coffee is shipped fresh. - Blue Bottle Coffee – 24 hours maximum between roasting and shipping. - Paradise Coffee Roasters – Roasting 3 times per week. Orders shipped the same day. - Atlas Coffee Club – _“When you order it, we roast it and ship it!”_- Bows & Arrows Roasters – Roasting 3 times per week. Subscriptions were sent out on Monday. ### More Advice For Ordering Coffee Online Some roasters will entice you to buy more coffee at once to save on shipping. Of course, this saves money on shipping. The downside is that the coffee will go stale before you can consume it all. I advise buying lighter-roasted coffee on large orders, as it stays fresher longer than dark-roasted coffee. Also, buying large quantities is a good option for making cold brew, as older coffee tends to shine when cold brewed. Another idea is to combine orders from friends and family. And I almost forgot, although all coffee roasters will grind coffee for you, I strongly advise getting your own grinder. The beans will stay fresh much longer. ### Resources [Why HTTPS Matters](https://web.dev/articles/why-https-matters) – Google article making the case for all sites to be secure.

# Ground Rules for Grinding Coffee [Grinding Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/grinding-coffee/)---by [CB Miller](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/cb-miller/)![Ground Rules for Grinding Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/ground-rules-for-grinding-coffee/rules-grinding-coffee.jpg) Why bother to find the freshest roasted beans if you are going to throw the flavor away at home? That’s what you do if you grind your beans well beforehand. It is tempting. You have the beans, and it only takes a few minutes to grind them into a nice, aromatic powder. But as the days pass, the cup’s flavor begins to fade. The scientific explanation is oxidation, a natural process that begins as soon as you open each bag of roasted beans and expose them to the air. Ground beans offer exponentially more surface area than beans alone, so by grinding ahead of time, you accelerate **the oxidation of the entire bean.** To maximize flavor in the cup, refrain from grinding until the last possible moment. Some coffee makers have built-in grinders, so as soon as the bean is ground, the brewing begins. If you have a stand-alone grinder, we suggest positioning it near your coffee maker. Prepare everything else ahead of time, and then, at the last moment, grind your beans and start brewing.![black coffee grinder](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/black-coffee-grinder1.DoQhx5r6_Z22j3bI.webp)_Krups Blade Coffee Grinder_### Tips for Griding Coffee at Home 1. Keep the grinder clean. 2. Never grind pre-flavored beans. 3. Grind just prior to brewing. 4. To achieve a more consistent grind, gently shake the apparatus while grinding. 5. Use the correct size for your equipment. Burr grinders allow you to pre-select the proper grind. With blade grinders timing is critical. Follow the guidelines below for the best results. Each blade grinder is different, so adjust accordingly. - Coarse Grind for French Press for 5-10 seconds. - Medium Grind for electric drip or most Pour-Over methods is 10-15 seconds. - Fine Grind for espresso machines grinds approximately 30 seconds. Of course, in matters of taste, there is no one recipe for success. Experiment with your equipment, timing, and ingredients to satisfy you. ### Resources [Best Coffee Grinders Under $100](https://ineedcoffee.com/best-coffee-grinders-100/) – Reviews of 4 different affordable coffee grinders.

Published on December 1, 2001--- #### CB Miller Small coffee roasters are perking up all over the country, recreating styles and blends which were nearly impossible to find just a few years ago. The quality of these blends remains unparalleled by those of the giant coffee companies. However, it is difficult to experience these wonderfully fresh roasted coffees because the roasters are scattered all over the country.

# Hacking Dark Roast – Tips on Brewing a Better Bold Coffee [Brewing Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/brewing-coffee/)---by [Michael Allen Smith](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/michael-allen-smith/)![Hacking Dark Roast – Tips on Brewing a Better Bold Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/hacking-dark-roast-tips-on-brewing-a-better-bold-coffee/HackingDarkRoast.jpg) There was a time when I liked the taste of dark-roasted coffee, but over the years, that roasty, bold flavor that I used to enjoy began to taste bitter and ashy. Recently, I decided to revisit my old dark-roasted friend to see if we could improve our relationship. I wanted to solve the riddle of why I used to like dark-roasted coffee but now consider it vile. At first, I thought it was because I had developed a better palate. Maybe my flavor expectations for coffee were now much higher? That would explain why I strongly prefer medium and light-roasted coffee, but not why I actually grew to dislike dark-roasted coffee. It was an interesting journey, and I discovered a lot. Here are some of the tricks I learned for making better dark roast coffee. ### #1 Freshness is More Important One of the most common questions asked about coffee is: How long will these beans stay fresh? You might hear a week, two weeks, or more. Coffees roasted dark enough to be labeled French Roast, Italian Roast, or Spanish Roast tend to go stale very rapidly—not weeks, but days. When coffee is roasted well into and even beyond the second crack, the structure of the coffee bean is more fragile and porous. This greatly shortens the window of freshness. I talked with one Seattle roaster who told me a dark French roast coffee might start to taste flat in as little as four days—four days from roast. You can try to seal the coffee as best as you can to preserve and extend freshness, but a heavily roasted coffee will age faster. If you enjoy coffee on the dark side, hack #1 is buying smaller volumes of coffee more frequently from a local roaster. If you buy from a grocery store, look for a recent roast date on the bag. Grocery stores will put the old bags in front of the fresh ones, so you may need to reach back for the fresh stuff. **Never buy a dark-roasted coffee without a roast date on the bag. Assume it is stale.** If you can’t find a super fresh dark roast at the grocery store, go for a medium-dark coffee. It will keep longer and still have enough body to please your dark side. The time of my life when I most enjoyed dark roasted coffee was when I first started [home roasting](https://ineedcoffee.com/roasting-coffee-in-a-popcorn-popper/). I’d roast up something dark, let it sit for one day, and then start brewing with that coffee. After many years of home coffee roasting, I discovered that the darker roasted coffees tasted better on days 2-5. Then I noticed a quality drop-off. By day 8, if any coffee were left, I would throw it away. If you are a true dark roast coffee fan, I recommend exploring home coffee roasting. We have many [home coffee roasting articles](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/roasting-coffee/) on INeedCoffee to get you started. By roasting yourself, you can ensure that your coffee is always fresh and that you roast just enough for your needs, so there is little or no waste.![Dark Roast 2 Face](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/201411DarkRoastTwoFacee.BsL8oj1L_jIlAu.webp)_From [Inanimate Objects Comics #44](https://ineedcoffee.com/inanimate-objects-comics-44/)_### #2 Reduce Brewing Temperature The standard advice regarding brewing temperatures is to brew just off a boil, usually between 195-205 F (or 90.5-96.1 C). This advice implies that your coffee will taste good as long as you are in the range. But there is more to the story. Lighter roasted coffees do well at the higher end of that range, and darker roasted coffees do better at the lower end. I performed a few brewing tests using the same dark-roasted coffee brewed at 195°F and 205°F. At 205°F, the coffee had every attribute that I dislike about dark roasts: bitter and ashy. At 195°F, the coffee was smoother and **no longer bitter.** At 195°F, coffee may taste slightly weaker. If you are using a 17-1 ratio (17 parts water to 1 part coffee), you can solve this problem by increasing the amount of coffee used in the brew. Experiment with a 16-1 or 15-1 ratio. Another path is to extend the brew time by 30-60 seconds. This works for brewing methods where you can control the brew time, such as a [French Press](https://ineedcoffee.com/press-pot-tutorial/), [Clever](https://ineedcoffee.com/clever-coffee-dripper-review/), or [Aeropress](https://ineedcoffee.com/upside-aeropress-coffee-brewing-tutorial/). With the Bonavita, you can dial in the exact temperature you want to brew your coffee. This is a great tool for coffee and tea, which are even more temperature-sensitive. ### #3 Pour a Smaller Amount of Coffee A few years ago, I noticed that I drink coffee at different speeds depending on how the coffee initially tastes. If the coffee is on the lighter roasted end with more delicate flavors, I drink it slower because I know as the coffee cools, it will continue to evolve and taste great. With the darker roasted coffees that push the body and chocolate notes, I will drink the coffee faster. The reason is that those flavor characteristics taste better when the coffee is hotter. As the coffee cools, those notes often get lost. I learned that the quality declines if I spend too much time drinking heavily roasted coffee. The solution here is to drink smaller amounts of coffee. Back when I was brewing 16-oz mugs of dark-roasted coffee, I would rarely be able to finish the last few ounces as the quality was nowhere near as good as the first few ounces. If you are brewing one cup at a time, brew less. If you are brewing larger amounts and storing coffee in a carafe, pour less. ### #4 Air Roasters vs Drum Roasters This next idea is debatable, but I believe it has merit. **Roasting dark coffee on a fluid bed air roaster will produce a cleaner, less burnt taste than roasting it on a drum roaster.** When coffee roasts, chaff separates from the bean. The chaff is blown out of the roasting chamber in an air roaster. With a rotating drum roaster, some chaff remains on the bean. This is not an issue at a lighter roast, but with darker roasts, the chaff can impart a burnt flavor onto the beans. Reduced airflow during roasting may be a cause for some of the bitter notes in darker roasted coffee. Here is a comment by _donlp37_ regarding air roasting on CoffeeForums: > Not only is it (air roasting) a more even roast, but I also know that much less smoke is circulated around the roasting beans. This way darker roasts can be achieved without a real charcoal or overly smokey taste. I’m not a professional roaster but have been home roasting coffee since 1998. The best dark roast coffees I have had all came from air roasters, be it a popcorn popper or the now-gone Hearthware line. The drum roasters I used did an outstanding job with medium and light roasts, but were uneven with darker coffee. ### Putting it All Together To hack the best dark roast coffee, I will use fresh coffee beans that are just a few days off roast. I will only buy or roast enough beans that I plan on consuming that week. I will grind my coffee just before brewing. I will use a lower brewing temperature and brew/pour just enough for a small or medium-sized mug. If I want more coffee, I will brew (or pour) again. If I can’t home roast, I will find a local roaster and time my visits for optimal freshness. So far, I haven’t discussed the brewing method. I could do a bunch of tests to determine which is best, but I doubt there will be consensus among all coffee drinkers. For me, the best option is going to be the AeroPress. The AeroPress design allows it to brew great coffee at lower temperatures, as covered in The Upside Down AeroPress Coffee Brewing Tutorial. Another excellent brewing option would be cold-brew [coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/cold-brew-coffee-is-not-rocket-science/). Although I don’t consider myself a fan of dark roast coffee, I now know a few tricks for when I want to reach for something darker.![aeropress-setup-pour-water-in-mug](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/aeropress-setup-pour-water-in-mug.CCudjyda_Z1NHX8B.webp)_Making coffee with the AeroPress._### Resources [Coffee Brewing Guide](https://ineedcoffee.com/coffee-brewing-guide/) – Our collection of coffee brewing tutorials.

# Hacking Decaf – The Swiss Water Story [Coffee and Health](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/coffee-health/)---by [Joseph Robertson](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/joseph-robertson/)![Hacking Decaf – The Swiss Water Story](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/hacking-decaf-the-swiss-water-story/hacking-decaf.jpg) Today, I want to break some walls down and talk about ‘Decaf Coffee!’ “GASP!” If you are like most people, you probably have a negative view of Decaf. It does, after all, carry an extensive stigma. Upon reading the first sentence, did you scoff, raise an eyebrow in disbelief or astonishment, or think/mutter anything such as “oh heck no, who would want decaf coffee?” or “What’s the point in that?” All I ask is that you take a little journey with me, and explore something I am certain will be fascinating and new to you.![decaf-1](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/decaf-1-432x650.6yzMlK_N_2hovid.webp) You see, I have had a number of ‘decaf’ coffees, which I have found to be quite delicious – coffees I have enjoyed immensely. There have also been numerous times I have tasted a decaf coffee alongside a regular coffee and had no clue I was tasting decaf. So to me, that begged the question – why is there so much negativity towards decaf? If you take a step back you can see that the stigma against decaf goes far beyond “it’s got no caffeine so what’s the point.” First, we need to take a look back – a brief history of the decaffeination of coffee. ### History of Decaf Coffee The origin of decaf seems like it should have a crazy story to go along with it – the story which is told is that decaf was ‘accidentally’ discovered by a German coffee merchant named Ludwig Roselius, when a shipment of green coffee got waterlogged and was ruined – upon receiving the coffee, their researchers determined that caffeine had been removed with minimal effect to the taste. I would love to tell a more entertaining origin story, but sometimes the biggest discoveries are accidents turned into an opportunity. In any case, someone in the late 1800s or early 1900s determined that caffeine could be removed intentionally, and thus began a long industry of brutalizing coffee. I say ‘brutalizing’ because up until recently, the process was either really messy, toxic, and/or simply resulted in otherwise destroying the natural flavor in the coffee (which admittedly doesn’t matter much if you start with poor quality green coffee that has little flavor to begin with). The original recorded method for decaf, invented by Ludwig Roselius in 1905, used benzene (a hydrocarbon that can be toxic) to extract caffeine from pre-moistened green coffee. This process has not been used for a long time. ### Decaf Methods Today, there are three overall main methods. A “direct solvent method” can be used, which will employ either Methylene Chloride or Ethyl Acetate. These chemicals are essentially circulated through the green coffee, in order to dissolve and then extract the caffeine. A second solvent method uses “supercritical carbon dioxide” at extremely high pressures to extract the caffeine. I can’t speak more specifically to those methods – having researched decaffeinated coffee, I discovered upon receiving a tour of the Swiss Water Process plant that much of the knowledge available about the process of removing caffeine from coffee is wrong. So I am reticent to make claims about processes to which I have not been directly educated.![decaf-4](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/decaf-4.CmvXg5aE_WKiH2.webp) The third method is what is employed by the Swiss Water Process, and another similar company called Mountain Water. This involves utilizing primarily water, green coffee solids, and carbon filters, to extract the caffeine naturally from the seeds into the liquid (more on this in a moment), and then filter it out of the liquid. Due to the lack of chemical use, this has long been a favored method. ### Decaf Stigma Now you have a very basic overview of the methods – let’s address the stigma associated with decaf coffee. If you look at the evolution of the coffee industry as a whole, this all starts to make a lot more sense. While coffee has long been consumed by cultures around the world, it wasn’t until the past 10 years or so that quality has really started to become a topic of interest. Take a step back 50 years, and you will see that mass-produced coffee in cans was all the rage. Take a step back even just 20 years, and you can start to see the surge in companies like Starbucks, which really push the cafe culture and consumption of espresso-based coffee. The reason for this surge in quality interest over the past few years has really been a shift in two areas – a desire for higher quality in society in general, but more importantly, a greater understanding of what goes into growing and processing coffee. Many of the changes in the areas of coffee farming have really started to come online in the past 5-8 years (coffee plants take 2-3 years from seed to maturity, so you can see how changes at the farm level take a while to percolate…so to speak).![decaf-table](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/decaf-table-650x432.CEPIBVjO_1nHTxf.webp) Back to decaf. If you consider that the quality of coffee, up until 10-15 years ago, was just “fine” – and then you look at the violent and often inefficient processes for removing caffeine from coffee – it is easy to see how most decaf probably was quite undesirable, for a great many years. Not only did you not get caffeine (which automatically is a deterrent to some people), but the coffee did not taste good (and certainly didn’t taste like the non-decaffeinated versions). Terrible! ### Swiss Water Process Swiss Water Process was originally developed in 1933/34, as a way to remove caffeine from coffee without using chemicals. For a very long time, they remained the only company that was removing caffeine without the use of chemicals. Unfortunately, for these many years, their process also wasn’t as efficient as it could be. While on my tour of the facility, I learned that it wasn’t all that long ago that their process would often result in inconsistent batches and coffee that was extremely difficult to roast. Even though the process uses only water, green coffee, and carbon filters – it is still a rather fascinatingly complex process that depends on some unique variables. In 2007 – right around the surge in interest for higher quality coffee – they sought to redevelop their processes, and today they produce 99.9% caffeine-free coffee through a process that is organic and kosher certified. On top of all that, the resulting coffee without caffeine when roasted is nearly indistinguishable from the before product (a claim I am happy to attest to through experience). They quite frankly have solved the decaf conundrum! Let’s take a look at the basics of the process, and then we will dig in deeper for those of you interested in a bit more of the science.![decaf-process](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/decaf-process.l0ZtI5QV_22to8i.webp) The Swiss Water Process uses three main elements (alongside the green coffee that is going to have its caffeine extracted) – Water, Green Coffee Extract (GCE), and Carbon in the form of activated charcoal which has been designed specifically to catch only the caffeine molecule. The green coffee is first polished in a big spinning drum – this removes the silverskin from the seed and any other foreign matter that might get in the way. It is then soaked in water – fun fact: green coffee beans typically have been dried down to about 9%-13% moisture level. In order to make the process more efficient, the green coffee needs a higher moisture level, thus it is soaked and the seeds end up twice their size (think about a sponge…a dry sponge doesn’t absorb water as readily, but a damp sponge will soak up completely). These seeds are then immersed in Green Coffee Extract (GCE), which contains no caffeine. The chemical makeup of the GCE and the green coffee seeds are so close, that the only difference is that caffeine – nature desires balance, so through osmosis some of the caffeine naturally moves from the seeds into the GCE. Once saturated with caffeine, this green coffee extract is passed through carbon filters – which Swiss Water has designed to specifically catch the caffeine molecule. The completely caffeine-free green coffee extract comes out the other end and is then passed back through. This process of the GCE flowing through the green coffee, naturally extracting the caffeine, and filtering it out continues for roughly 10 hours per batch of coffee. Once the green coffee has had 99.9% of its caffeine removed, it is then transported to a special dryer, where all that extra moisture is removed such that the green coffee is returned to its original moisture level. What you end up with is green coffee with the exact same chemical makeup, minus the caffeine. Check out this video for an overview of the process._[Swiss Water® Process animation video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAEQ4G-1jTQ&#x26;feature=youtu.be&#x26;ab_channel=SwissWaterDecaf)_ The entire process is fascinatingly scientific – everything hinges on how the water balance in the coffee is handled. Our tour guide – the man in charge of establishing/managing all of their critical systems – talked mostly of ‘Water Activity Level,’ which relates to humidity. ‘Water activity level’ above a certain point means moisture will be coming out of the green coffee seeds too fast, it will essentially sit on the surface, and that will result in mold and other undesirable elements. ‘Water Activity Level’ below a certain point means the coffee is going to dry out very fast. Too much variability in this critical element means that they will lack consistency during the extraction process – in fact, green beans that have a water activity level that is too high end up with their internal structure completely distorted after the process. What was described to us was essentially a migration of moisture in the bean towards the center and solid mass towards the exterior, creating a hollow seed that does not roast properly in the slightest. So it comes down to a matter of stability within the seed itself. Think of the water and solids within the green coffee seeds as their own ecosystem…healthy, delicious coffee has a balanced internal ecosystem – and coffee with a balanced internal ecosystem can have its caffeine removed efficiently and with minimal effect on the subtleties of that coffee’s flavor characteristics.![decaf-building](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/decaf-building-650x432.avFOyKe3_Z1h1HPt.webp) A fascinating point of interest is the information that they have learned and developed in terms of the best temperature/humidity for green coffee stability, which suggests an answer as to why Seattle turned into such a hotbed of growth in the coffee industry. The ideal conditions – in terms of temperature and humidity – for green coffee to remain at its most stable, happen to be the general climate conditions that are prevalent in Seattle and much of the Pacific Northwest. This is an incredibly fascinating observation and one I intend to explore more in the future. Suffice to say, for a place like Phoenix, Arizona, which is hot and dry, in order to store green coffee in a stable state, you would have to have a special climate-controlled storehouse. Back to the Swiss Water Process for hacking perfect Decaf: The important thing to note about everything that happens during their process is that it is designed to leave the components of the seed, which are responsible for the flavor elements, essentially untouched. Green Coffee Extract (GCE) contains all water-soluble components of green coffee, which are common among all coffees. This means the GCE does NOT contain components of the green coffee that are responsible for the flavor characteristics – nor are those components water-soluble in the green coffee state (so they don’t factor into the chemical balance which results in caffeine being transferred by osmosis). In other words, the GCE has no flavor, and no flavor is taken out of the green coffee during the process. This doesn’t necessarily mean the resulting flavor is completely untouched, as the coffee is going through an extensive process, and soluble components are being moved around – some of them ending up on the surface of the seed, where originally they were within (this is actually what results in a slight color change of the seeds after processing, and what results in a darker looking roasted seed). Variability in temperature throughout the process is also a concern – one which the team at Swiss Water has worked hard to address. Reductions in temperature variability mean they are able to process at a lower temperature, which results in less effect on the flavor components of the green coffee. They are constantly in the process of reducing variability at every step, giving them greater control over the exacting scientific process of removing a single type of molecule from the coffee.![decaf-facilities](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/decaf-facilities-432x650.G9HsuN1O_Zc7MT9.webp) As a side note, I am curious if some of the flavor changes in the coffee after the process are due to the seeds behaving differently in the roast. It is certainly apparent that the green coffee has a bit of a different behavior when roasting, and afterward. ### The Verdict I’ve tasted a number of before and after coffees that have gone through this process. In all cases, one can detect a slight difference – but in most of these cases the difference is so slight that I couldn’t put a finger on what the difference was, and often that difference was elusive (such that I would go back and forth tasting before/after in cupping sips, and the ‘difference’ would fade, leaving me two different cups that tasted identical). One hypothesis is that removing the caffeine results in less discernible bitterness, as caffeine has a characteristic of bitterness – it’s a tough word to use because none of the cups we tasted were ‘bitter’ in the strictest sense of the word, but the versions without caffeine appear to be a bit smoother, or have a bit less on the trailing end of the flavor.![decaf-5-cupping](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/decaf-5-cupping-650x432.Ba-SxRvL_9DgcD.webp) It is easy to say though, that was a blind tasting done with several coffees – some of them regular some decaf – I could not tell you which are regular and which are without caffeine. A note of interest if you are buying decaffeinated coffee: it appears that once roasted, the coffee without caffeine breaks down faster than coffee that has not gone through the process. That is, you may consider being sure you use your bag of coffee within a couple of weeks instead of a few, and make sure you only grind just before you brew. I haven’t been able to confirm this, and plan to do some testing to figure out if this may be true or perhaps just a fluke. The conclusion is simply this. Forget about what you think you know about Decaf – these people have completely hacked Decaf coffee, down to specific molecule manipulation. Quite simply, if you love the taste of coffee, but for whatever reason need or want to reduce or remove caffeine from your daily consumption, then look no further than coffee made with Swiss Water Process.![decaf-6-cupping](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/decaf-6-cupping-650x432.BcRaXsCn_Z2aWbG6.webp)_This article first appeared in [Extracted Magazine](https://www.extractedmagazine.com/)._### References [How is caffeine removed to produce decaffeinated coffee?](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-is-caffeine-removed-t/) – Article from Scientific American.

# Hearthware Gourmet Coffee Roaster [Roasting Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/roasting-coffee/)---by [Michael Allen Smith](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/michael-allen-smith/)![Hearthware Gourmet Coffee Roaster](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/gourmet-coffee-roaster/hwg150x2391.jpg) Before Hearthware developed the popular [Precision Roaster](https://ineedcoffee.com/home-roasting-with-the-hearthware-precision/), they created the Gourmet Roaster. Like the Precision, the Gourmet is an indoor coffee roaster that can roast 1/2 cup of green coffee beans at a time. It is also very easy to operate and can make excellent-tasting coffee with minimal effort.![Hearthware Gourmet](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/hwg150x2391.DSX8jJCW_2iI7cS.webp)_The Hearthware Gourmet_### Differences The Gourmet roasts slightly faster than the Precision but is a bit louder. If you need a quiet roaster, this is NOT the one for you. The Gourmet has a manual dial to initiate roasting and the cooling cycle.![Hearthware Gourmet Dial](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/dial200x191.CDLwNeUj_HBz3u.webp)_The Gourmet Dial_### Setup Owners of the Hearthware Gourmet won’t need any help operating this equipment. For those considering a purchase, let’s walk through a roasting cycle. The first step is to lock the glass roasting pot onto the power base. The pot has four tabs that glide into grooves on the power base.![roaster base](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/base150x196.D0LenUzR_Z29jVJQ.webp)_The base of the Hearthware Gourmet Coffee Roaster_ Pour 1/2 cup of green coffee beans into the roasting pot. Don’t overfill the pot; the beans could roast unevenly or burn.![pour green beans into roaster](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/pour150x191.Br6Y5TPv_BfKCW.webp)_Pour green coffee beans into the coffee roaster._ You are ready to roast once you have the lid securely on top of the roasting chamber. Turn the knob to your desired roast. Note that the label Medium is a 10. To me, this yields a very dark roast. Most roasts will do better in the 6 to 9 range. However, one shouldn’t merely trust your initial knob setting. Once the roast hits your desired sweet spot, you can and should force the cooldown. The knob isn’t clear on exactly what number initiates the cool-down. It is just below the number 3. When the beans are perfect, turn the knob to just under the three setting. ### Roasting![roast 1](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/roast1_200x110.BMEj3VUs_Z1lG5XP.webp)_Start of coffee roast._![roast 2](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/roast2_200x110.C1PAU8ix_Z2bFkqG.webp)_The coffee roast moves from yellow to brown._![roast 3](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/roast3_200x112.CEtZZ0JX_Z2iLRWw.webp)_The coffee roast is getting darker._![roast 4](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/roast4_200x112.CSjfVQsy_1iRUFR.webp)_The coffee roast is now completed._### Finish and Cleanup Once the cool-down has been completed, you can collect your coffee. For coffee tip storage, read [Coffee Storage](https://ineedcoffee.com/coffee-storage/) by Ryan Jacobs. After the coffee is safely stored, the next step is cleaning the equipment. Between each roast, you will need to remove the chaff. Open the lid on the chaff collector and dump out the chaff. Using the small toothbrush attached to the back of the power-base, brush out any chaff clinging to the inside.![chaff collector](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/gourmet-roaster-chaff-collector.DEceoCxz_ZHJ1Lt.webp)_After it has cooled down, clean out the chaff collector before the next roast._### Conclusion At the time of this writing (August 2001), Hearthware is having a close-out sale on this model. What used to sell for $120 is now going for $45. This deal will not last forever. I encourage anyone interested in home-roasting coffee to take advantage of this sale. You will not find a better coffee roaster at this price. Published on August 1, 2001--- #### Michael Allen Smith Michael Allen Smith is both a coffee fanatic and a web developer.

# The Zassenhaus Manual Coffee Grinder [Grinding Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/grinding-coffee/)---by [Myron Joshua](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/myron-joshua/)![The Zassenhaus Manual Coffee Grinder](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/grind-your-own-coffee-beans/zassenhaus-coffee-grinder1.jpg)**Would You Drink A Beer That Was Opened a Week Ago?** Imagine walking into a supermarket on a hot summer day and picking up two six-packs of beer (or cola for you caffeine addicts) to last you the next week (or so). Now, when you get to the checkout counter you have a great idea. Rather than hassle with those little pull-tabs and trying to yank them to open the darn can, why not have the checkout girl do it for you? Wow! Save the hassle at home and you won’t have to worry about those pull-tabs messing up your house. At the counter, the checkout girl is more than happy to oblige. As you begin sipping that first beer on the way out, you realize what a great idea it was. At home in the evening, you decide to have a beer. The thought of struggling to open the can used to be dreadful. Now, you only have to open the refrigerator door, pull out a pre-opened can and enjoy. Alas! Although the beer is cold, it has a dead, flat taste. ### Moral of the Story Don’t unlock flavor until it is time to drink your beverage. The same is true for coffee. Don’t get tired of grinding your own coffee. Return to the daily grind and enjoy the taste of fresh coffee. Every time you buy fresh coffee beans and ask the checkout person at the coffee shop to grind your beans you are opening up the “flavor cells” and causing your beans to begin losing their flavor rapidly. The purpose of grinding the beans is to create a larger surface area that will release the flavor and oils into the surrounding hot water. If coffee is prematurely exposed to air, it “breathes”, leaving less and less flavor for the brew, when the water finally hits the bean. I was startled when a friend of mine in San Francisco asked two proprietors of Peet’s Stores what percentage of customers ask for ground beans. I thought that in the heart of US Coffee Culture Land the vast majority bought whole beans and ground them at home. Surprisingly, the answer from the Peet’s guys was that 2/3 to 3/4 of all purchases were for pre-ground coffee. This means that the vast majority of coffee drinkers (except those who buy ground coffee daily) are sacrificing one of the most crucial elements contributing to the taste of a cup of coffee. ### Why we don’t grind What are the reasons people don’t daily grind their own coffee at home? 1. Those grinders make such a racket. 2. There is always such a mess to clean up. 3. A decent grinder costs too much. 4. Why waste the time? 5. A grinder is another contraption that takes up space on the counter. 6. The grind in the coffee shop is more “professional” than what I can do at home. 7. Can’t you just store pre-ground coffee in the refrigerator or freezer? ### The Journey I made the journey from pre-grinding to grinding my own. It was perhaps the most important decision I made since I decided to buy quality Arabica coffee. And it WAS a journey because I had to come to grips with the six points listed above, some of which have a bit of truth to them. In the process of finding the right grinder for me, I read a lot of grinder reviews online. In many of the reviews, people make note of the noise, use of counter space, or the mess (due to static that causes the grinds to fly out and cover everything in sight). Originally, I thought that a good grinder, which would overcome most of these problems, would be a major investment of money upfront (even before worrying about maintenance). Eventually, I found that was not the case, but I’ll share that part of the story later. ### Moisture is Bad At first, I thought that I could just store pre-ground coffee in the refrigerator or freezer. Over time, I learned that storing coffee in the fridge or freezer results in an inferior-tasting coffee. I found that moisture can seriously affect the coffee. This is especially true when dealing with pre-ground beans, which have a lot of surface area. The condensation of moisture from removing and returning the coffee to the freezer ruins the coffee. In my quest to find the best-tasting home-brewed coffee possible, I had to take a step forward. ### Whirly Blade Grinders First, I bought a whirly blade grinder. It was small, so it did not take up much counter space. It was also a fairly inexpensive machine. Basically, there is a spinning blade inside a single compartment. The beans sit in the compartment and are chopped up. Grinding my own beans at home allowed me much more flexibility. I could change my bean blends for different brewing methods. Add to that the joy of the ritual of making a cup of coffee — seeing the whole bean, hearing it getting crushed, and releasing the smell of fresh coffee beans. This was very satisfying. I found that the coffee was much fresher and tasted much better when I ground my own beans, but this type of grinder had some major drawbacks: 1. The cleanup job after each use was a pain. 2. The noise in my small apartment drove everyone else batty. 3. The grind was very uneven. 4. The coffee grounds heated up slightly during the process (releasing/wasting some of the flavors). ### Burr Grinders I decided to take a step forward. I scanned the Web and found that there is a superior type of grinder called a “burr” grinder. Burr grinders are better than spinning blade grinders because the bean goes through the grinder only one time. The beans are loaded into one compartment, proceed through a blade mechanism, and the grounds are then dispersed into a second compartment. This produces a more even grind. ### Which Burr Grinder? I did a lot of investigation about various burr grinders. There is a large price range. They go from affordable home grinders to industrial grinders that are very expensive. Virtually all that I found were electric, which meant that they were going to be too noisy for my household. I decided to get some expert advice. ### Zassenhaus I had the chutzpah to drop a note on the subject to Christopher Schaefer. His reply was: > Have you investigated hand-cranked German coffee mills? (such as a Zassenhaus) They provide a wide variety of grind styles suitable for all coffee brewing devices (even home pump-driven espresso machines) and are efficient when used intelligently. They are quiet, although it does take an investment of effort to grind for larger quantities of coffee.![close up grinder](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/zass-close.CUlUkARj_Z1ifx0B.webp)_Close-up view of the Zassenhaus coffee grinder._ Actually, I had already heard of the Zassenhaus from the pages of David Bayer and Sweet Maria’s. After a little more investigation and deliberation, I decided to buy a Zassenhaus. If you are interested, you might want to look at the reviews on CoffeeGeek. ### Zassenhaus Advantages My family used to complain about the noise of the electric grinder, but the Zassenhaus grinder is practically silent. Every morning I grind what I need for breakfast, without waking anyone else. And I find that this grinder doesn’t create much of a mess. The grinder itself looks great on the counter; I think that it adds character to the kitchen. It is such an interesting machine that my family members want to take turns grinding the coffee themselves. There is no hassle in taking it down, and I think that adjusting the machine to grind for my evening stovetop espresso is easy. Maintenance is also minimal (see the link to the instruction sheet). Furthermore, several people have reiterated the claim that the Zassenhaus grinder will last long enough to be passed from one generation to another. It is made of hardwood and its mechanisms are guaranteed for 10 years. ### Related Resources [David Bayer’s Zassenhaus Hand Mill article](https://www.math.columbia.edu/~bayer/coffee/#B "Zassenhaus Hand Mill ") Published on January 1, 2001--- #### Myron Joshua Myron Joshua grew up on Chocolate Milk with the gurgling of his mother’s Folgers being percolated in the background.

# Goodbye to the Morning Coffee and Newspaper Ritual [Coffee History](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/coffee-history/)---by [Alex Scofield](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/alex-scofield/)![Goodbye to the Morning Coffee and Newspaper Ritual](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/goodbye-to-the-morning-coffee-and-newspaper-ritual/newspaper-and-coffee1.jpg) This past weekend, my longtime daily ritual of the morning coffee and newspaper came to an end. The coffee part of it will endure, of course, but not the newspaper part. My subscription to the Boston Globe ended on Saturday, and resuming the subscription will cost triple the current rate. The hike is almost certainly a reflection of the Globe’s raging labor disputes and revenue losses. Whatever the reason, the writing has been on the wall for a while. Last Saturday’s Globe will almost certainly be the final hard-copy newspaper ever delivered to my home — for the record, I drank _Dean’s Beans Fine and Mellow_ coffee as I read it.![coffee and newspaper](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/coffee-newspaper.cHi_Nomo_BtqDI.webp) Coffee and the newspaper made a good team for a century or so. It’s a classic diner image, somebody sipping the morning’s brew while browsing through the day’s news. This happened at the “third places” around town, in homes, and in offices everywhere. Hot coffee can’t be chugged, so with proper pacing, a mug could last all the way through a good, thorough reading of the day’s key articles. For families with multiple readers, the morning newspaper also provided lessons in sharing and cooperation — Dad got the business section first, Mom started with the front section, while Sis read the arts/entertainment section and Junior took sports. (Mildly sexist, but you get the point.) There’s obvious irony in a niche-subject blogger weeping over the demise of newsprint. Some of this is sentimentality from a former newspaper editor, knowing that a way of life for at least four generations of my family just ended. In time, I’ll probably get over the feeling that news isn’t news until the print edition is in hand. I’m far from a technophobe, and there are plenty of virtues to the online news medium — it’s greener, — more timely, and it potentially can blend the best of print and broadcast media. But there are other reasons for my reluctance to morph from the morning coffee-and-newspaper routine to the morning coffee and laptop. I already spend many hours glued to my computer each day, and I’m not especially eager to spend yet more time staring at pixels on a screen. My klutziness makes this an unwelcome change, too. Spilling coffee on a newspaper was no big deal; spilling it on a laptop would be a fiasco.

# Grinding Down the Competition [Grinding Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/grinding-coffee/)---by [Stefanie Spencer](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/stefanie-spencer/)![Grinding Down the Competition](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/grinding-down-the-competition/burr-grinder.jpg) It is well-accepted that whole coffee beans stay fresher longer than already ground coffee, so why doesn’t everyone buy whole bean coffee? It adds one more seemingly time-consuming step to the process: the grinding. Although the old hand-crank grinders were very tedious, today you have many options that fit into our warp-speed lifestyle. In only a few days after grinding, by exposing more of its surface area to the oxygen around it, coffee loses about 80% of its aromatic qualities that create the flavorful brew we all love. The best time to grind the beans is right before you make the coffee. The easiest way to do this for drip coffee is the programmable, automatic, all-in-one coffee maker; it takes care of almost everything for you. You dump in the coffee beans and the water, and voila! It does the rest. Set it for the time you want it to start in the morning, then it grinds the coffee, moves it to the drip basket, makes the coffee (many of them even utilize a thermal carafe), and beeps to let you know it is ready. Some of these units require more effort to clean than others, so keep that in mind as you compare features. Ease of use is definitely a characteristic that ranks high on my list of importance. Maybe you are extremely happy with your current coffee maker and have no desire to search for a new one – no problem! There are many, many stand-alone grinders on the market today. They fall into these two categories: blade grinders and burr grinders. The most common and lower-priced ones are blade grinders. They use a rotating blade, very similar to a food processor, to break down the beans. The fineness of the grind is determined by the time that you leave the blade running, which will be different depending on the number of beans in the grinder, which in turn makes it difficult to attain a consistent coarseness each time. The positive note of a blade grinder is the low cost and the small size, especially suited for crowded countertops; however, the negatives are that it produces an uneven grind and heats the grinds as it processes them (thereby reducing the quality of the brew). The other option is a burr grinder. A “burr” is a cast piece of metal that has sharp pointed projections on it, like a coarse file or a rasp. It grinds by compressing the beans through a stationary burr and a rotating burr. Some machines use cone-shaped burrs and others use two flat burrs, but the quality of both is about the same. The best thing about these is the consistency of the grind. You can set the dial to the exact coarseness desired and the beans are evenly ground when they exit the burrs. This is great for a French press that needs an even, coarse grind. If there are fine particles mixed in with the coarse ones, the fines will go through the metal filter and end up in your cup. This consistency is also absolutely necessary for an espresso machine. An espresso grind needs to be very fine and even to produce a consistent shot. It takes approximately 23 seconds to brew through an espresso machine, and a variation of 5 seconds, either way, can ruin the shot. For the drip coffee maker, it has the quality of being easy to use. You don’t need to watch and time the grinder for the coarseness; you just dump the beans in the hopper, set the desired coarseness, and it moves them from the hopper to the tray as it grinds. Also, it does not heat the grounds like the blade grinder, retaining the aromatics and quality of the coffee, and it grinds the same amount of coffee faster than a blade grinder would. The negatives of burr grinders are usually the larger size and the higher cost.![virtuoso-grinder](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/virtuoso-grinder.DRw7SDZX_1mucdX.webp) Whichever option you choose, grinding right before brewing will produce a more flavorful brew. Try it out for yourself and see the difference.

# Hacking the Starbucks Barista Grinder [Grinding Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/grinding-coffee/)---by [Ryan Jacobs](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/ryan-jacobs/)![Hacking the Starbucks Barista Grinder](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/hacking-the-starbucks-barista-grinder/2832924471_142e46d4c1_z.jpg) My first espresso machine was the Starbucks Barista espresso machine. It uses a pressurized portafilter which allows you to use a coarser espresso grind. For years, I used the Starbucks Barista Grinder with this machine and it worked wonderfully. Eventually the Barista espresso machine gave way to the [Rancilio Silvia](https://ineedcoffee.com/rancilio-silvia-espresso-machine-tips/). While my grinder was able to deliver decent espresso, I never could reliably produce a great shot. Too often, the shots were pulling way too fast. What I needed was a finer grind, but my grinder couldn’t deliver. Or could it? It turns out that this grinder was adjusted to work optimally with the Starbucks Barista machine at its finest setting. With a little work, you can adjust yours to grind coffee fine enough to yield a properly pulled espresso in the Rancilio Silvia. The adjustments I make below are specific to the Rancilio Silvia, but you should be able to get a setting that works for your espresso machine using the same technique. Here are the steps to hack the Starbucks Barista Grinder. ### #1 Unplug the grinder The insides of the grinder expose some electrical components. We’ll play it safe and make sure it gets no power. ### #2 Remove the Hopper Gently twist the hopper counter-clockwise until it won’t move any further. Your arrow on the hopper should be past the line on the gray sleeve that displays the grind settings as shown in the photo. At this point, the hopper should pull straight up.![Twist hopper counter-clockwise](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/2832927397_91a42aab9f_z.BL39ge11_sBxHY.webp)_Twist hopper counter-clockwise_![Pull hopper straight up](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/2832928383_3f4d5cfa5a_z.CcH-EY6V_1Gudqk.webp)_Pull hopper straight up_### #3 Remove the Dial Grab the gray grind dial firmly and pull straight out away from the grinder body until it pulls off. This is similar to pulling off an oven dial.![Grab grind dial firmly.](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/2833766368_489a67cfc0_z.BDk38wbR_2tCKnv.webp)_Grab grind dial firmly._![Pull off grind dial](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/2832926093_8739e0658c_z.CsKUoqEV_Z2c2JWh.webp)_Pull off the grind dial._### #4 Remove the black grinder housing Turn the grinder upside down. On the bottom, you will see 4 notches or tabs close to each corner. Insert one or two flathead screwdrivers or butter knives into a couple of the tabs. Gently lever the knives outward from the grinder in rotation on each of the notches. Work back and forth gently until you can tell that the housing body has come away. If you have ever changed a bicycle tire with tire levers, this process is a bit similar. Do this for each of the notches. Now you can turn the grinder right side up and slide off the housing.![Turn the grinder upside down](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/2833763050_8d1f73d178_z.DmG4SueO_usprL.webp)_Turn the grinder upside down._![Remove the black grinder housing](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/2832922545_b9558fb948_z.DUjlGda3_1d1dqz.webp)_Remove the black grinder housing._### #5 Remove the gray housing This will pull straight off.![Remove the gray housing](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/2833760966_8018ef4e29_z.rXX01izZ_9ETv6.webp)_Remove the gray housing_### #6 Remove the burr assembly This pulls straight off.![Remove the burr assembly](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/2832924471_142e46d4c1_z.DYUVuHFz_mIUOG.webp)_Remove the burr assembly._### #7 Remove the wheel with tabs I don’t know what else to call this, but it is that piece of plastic just below the burr assembly. It has 4 locations where there are notches that can be levered with the butter knives/screwdrivers. Before you begin removing these, mark your existing settings with a marker in case you need to reset things. Gently use the knives to remove each tab. Again be patient to gently loosen each notch. You will hear a snap or click when this happens. At two of the notches, there are little posts that stick into the holes of the selection wheel below. Once we have this removed, we will rotate it counterclockwise a few holes at a time and snap it back into place until our grind is the way we want it. I found that moving it over three holes from its default setting did the trick.![Remove the wheel with tabs](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/2832925245_f8fc5b38cb_z.CLblfPUf_S2RvP.webp)_Remove the wheel with tabs._### #8 Adjust and Test You can put the burr assembly and hopper back on without reassembling everything in order to test your grind out. Repeat step 7 until you get it right. Then, re-assemble the grinder in reverse order based on the way you disassembled it. ### Resources [Rancilio Silvia Espresso Machine Tips](https://ineedcoffee.com/rancilio-silvia-espresso-machine-tips/) – Ideas on improving your espresso shots.

# Hawaiian Coffee [Coffee History](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/coffee-history/)---by [Chris Arnold](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/chris-arnold/)![Hawaiian Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/hawaiian-coffee/hawaiimap1.gif) The Hawaiian islands conjure up visions of paradise. But that is not all. The coffee lover also knows that coffee from Hawaii is known for its high praise, accompanied by an equally high price. Hawaiian coffees are the only coffees grown in the United States (sorry, Puerto Rico is a territory). Although many think of Hawaiian Kona Coffee, Royal Kona Coffee, or Hawaiian Gold Kona Coffee as being the best or even the only coffee Hawaii has to offer, many do not realize that the islands of Hawaii have a lot more to offer than just pure Kona Coffee. We will go into a brief history of how coffee got to the Hawaiian Isles, as well as the geographic layout of the islands and the varieties that are grown on each. As we get into the different flavors they bring to the cup, you will see that Hawaiian coffee beans are as varied as the islands and peoples themselves. This article will discuss Maui coffee, Kauai coffee, Molokai coffee, and Oahu coffee. The term Kona Coffee encompasses so much that we will dedicate an entire article just to Kona Coffee Beans and The Big Island of Hawaii at a later date. ### History Coffee Trees arrived in Hawaii in the early 1800s through various means. One way was in 1825. The British ship H.M.S. Blonde brought coffee trees from Brazil. These trees were planted in Oahu and then spread to other islands. The first actual coffee plantation was on the North Shore of Kauai. As the flourishing coffee plantations of the 19th century in Hawaii gave way to the 20th century, the future of coffee in Hawaii was uncertain. Sugar tariffs were lifted on the mainland in 1900. Quickly, coffee plantations were replaced with sugar cane fields. But in the 1960s and 1970s, coffee once again became a delicacy, and people were willing to pay more for unique coffees. As a result, the coffee plantations saw their second wind. After 100 years, the life of coffee in Hawaii has come full circle. There are now upwards of 7,000 acres producing about 7 million pounds of green coffee each year. Hawaiian Isle coffee is still one of the most expensive, relatively high-volume coffees consumed in the world, along with the likes of Jamaican Blue Mountain Coffee (JMB). ### Geography First, here is a quick primer on the different islands of Hawaii. There are eight islands – Hawaii (called The Big Island), Kahoolawe, Lanai, Maui, Molokai, Oahu, Kauai, and Niihau. Of these, coffee (always Arabica) is only grown on five of the eight islands. Here is a map as well as a breakdown of the islands, regions, varieties, and some notes on each:![hawaii map](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/hawaiimap1.DVYXhbKs_1OklX5.webp)_Hawaii Map_### Maui Growing Area(s): Ka’anapali, Haleakala, Hana Varieties: Mokka, Yellow Caturra, Red Catuai, and Typica Price Range for Roasted: $14-$24/lb Price Range for Green: $13-$23/lb - The Mokka has hints of nuts and chocolate, medium acidity, medium body, and a long finish. - The Yellow Caturra hits you with spice, cinnamon, licorice, and allspice. It is low acid yet full-bodied, with a dry finish. - The Red Catuai has hints of spice, medium acidity, full body, and a wine-like finish. - The Typica is nutty, much like a Kona, and has medium to high acidity, medium body, and a lingering finish.![green beans](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/green-beans.Dqpt0E4V_Km6SO.webp)_The very small un-roasted Maui Mokka bean (left) compared to the Galapagos bean (right)._### Kauai Growing Area(s): Kalaheo Varieties: Yellow Catuai, Red Catuai, Typica, Mundo Novo, San Ramon, Ikatu Price Range for Roasted: $12-$21/lb Price Range for Green: $6-$8/lb - There are some smaller farms, but the main coffee farm on Kauai is called the Kauai Coffee Company. - The Yellow Catuai and Typica are sweet, nutty, low acid, full-bodied, with a medium finish. - The Red Catuai has hints of cardamom and spice, has medium acidity, and is a mild to medium-bodied coffee, with a sweet rounded finish. - The Mundo Novo, San Ramon, and Ikatu varieties have not been produced for a while, but may in the future. ### Molokai Growing Area(s): Kualapuu Varieties: Red Catuai Price Range for Roasted: $24-$28 Price Range for Green: Unknown (hard to find) - Molokai Coffee Company in Kualapuu, and The Coffees of Hawaii are the names here. There is a Co-Op system of smaller farmers, producing organic coffee in 2008. - Molokai coffee is pretty hard to find in most places. - Both the wet-processed Malulani Estate coffee and the dry-processed Molokai Muleskinner can have a floral aroma, berry and caramel notes, are mildly acidic, rich in body, and have a long-lasting chocolatey finish. Interesting herbal notes can also be noted from time to time. ### Oahu Growing Area(s): North Shore between Wahiawa and Waialua Species: Typica Price Range for Roasted: $17-$21 Price Range for Green: $12-$14 (hard to find) - Dole is one name here. - Oahu coffee is also hard to find. - Generally labeled as Waialua coffee, it is low in acidity, medium in body, and has a dry, fruity finish. ### Hawaii (Big Island) Growing Area(s): Kona, Kau, Puna, Hamakua Species: Typica, Caturra, Moka Price Range for Roasted: $15-$40 Price Range for Green: $10-$25 Kona is the Big Kahuna here. We will dedicate another article to this since it covers the most territory.![Kauai Coffee Company Plantation](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/kauai3.C7ZH-eTr_ZFrBYm.webp)_Kauai Coffee Company Plantation_### Conclusion At least now you have a better idea of the flavors you can get from Hawaiian coffee and approximate costs and you appreciate how fortunate we are to have the coffees coming out of Hawaii, considering that it was near extinction not long ago. And if you are looking to buy Fair Trade coffee or Organic coffee, Hawaiian coffee is a good choice. While not all are certified organic, many are going in that direction or are organic by default. And we know that the farmers are generally paid well, so Fair Trade certification is not really too much of a concern in this situation. If you want roasted coffee, a quick Google search will turn up an endless supply of companies willing to charge you as much as $40 for a pound of Hawaiian Isle Coffee (and it may be worth it). However, if you want to save some serious money by home roasting, there is a great opportunity to buy raw, unroasted green coffee beans at a much-reduced price and roast them yourself. It will be fresher and allow you to try a wider variety without dipping into your kid’s college fund. Hawaiian green coffee is readily available on the internet via a quick Google search. ### Resources [Everything You Wanted to Know About Coffee From Hawaii](https://ineedcoffee.com/everything-you-wanted-to-know-about-coffee-from-hawaii/) – Review of _The Hawai’i Coffee Book_ by Shawn Steiman.

# Henry David Thoreau: (Anti?) Coffee Achiever [Coffee People](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/coffee-people/)---by [Alex Scofield](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/alex-scofield/)![Henry David Thoreau: (Anti?) Coffee Achiever](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/henry-david-thoreau-anti-coffee-achiever/henry-david-thoreau-coffee1.jpg) Imagine retreating to nature, embarking on a journey in living simply, confronting only life’s essentials. You’d be forced to bring only the barest of necessities, and debate what few belongings you simply couldn’t live without. ### Do You Need Coffee? If you think that Henry David Thoreau never pondered the significance of coffee during his famed stay at Walden Pond, think again. Historians agree that when Thoreau moved into his Walden home in 1845, there were not yet any Starbucks franchises in Concord, Massachusetts. Yet coffee makes a surprising number of appearances in Walden, and Thoreau has plenty to say on the subject. Many of his Concord neighbors were drinking it, and today’s coffee lover might be surprised how familiar a role coffee played in the lives of Concordians a century and a half ago.![henry david thoreau coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/henry-david-thoreau-coffee1.Bc-qqrsf_Z6sg3P.webp)_Was Henry David Thoreau a Coffee Achiever?_### Visitors Bearing Coffee Contrary to popular belief, Thoreau was not a hermit at his Walden home. Visitors were welcome, and indeed a chapter of the book is devoted to the (mostly human) visitors he had. There is an oft-alluded to Canadian woodchopper who visited frequently, a man of humble means, who had a noticeable fondness for coffee. > He was cast in the coarsest mould; a stout but sluggish body, yet gracefully carried, with a thick sunburnt neck, dark bushy hair, and dull sleepy blue eyes, which were occasionally lit up with expression,” says Thoreau of the woodchopper (who is unnamed in Walden, although Thoreau scholars are confident that his name was Alek Therien. “He wore a flat gray cloth cap, a dingy wool-colored greatcoat, and cowhide boots. He was a great consumer of meat, usually carrying his dinner to his work a couple of miles past my house — for he chopped all summer — in a tin pail; cold meats, often cold woodchucks, and coffee in a stone bottle which dangled by a string from his belt; and sometimes he offered me a drink. Thoreau leaves us hanging, and we are never enlightened as to whether he took Therien up on his kind offer. But in later passages, we see that Therien had a deeply ingrained coffee-drinking habit. > In the winter he had a fire by which at noon he warmed his coffee in a kettle,” writes Thoreau; “and as he sat on a log to eat his dinner the chickadees would sometimes come round and alight on his arm and peck at the potato in his fingers; and he said that he “liked to have the little fellers about him. Of Therien, Thoreau later asks, “Could he dispense with tea and coffee?” Therien may have drunk coffee as a daily social routine, or may well have been something of a caffeine junkie. In either event, the answer to Thoreau’s question is an emphatic “No!” Indeed, coffee appeared to be a luxury craved by many Concordians of the most modest means. Thoreau purchased the shanty of an Irish railroad laborer named James Collins and used the boards to construct his Walden home. Early in Walden, Thoreau describes the scene inside the shanty he was soon to purchase, and passing the Collins family on the road after the purchase: > There was a stove, a bed, and a place to sit, an infant in the house where it was born, a silk parasol, gilt-framed looking-glass, and a patent new coffee-mill nailed to an oak sapling, all told. > One large bundle held their all — bed, coffee-mill, looking-glass, hens — all but the cat[.] ### Let Them Drink Coffee Thoreau’s aversion to coffee seems more economically principled than a matter of taste; we cannot tell whether he joined Therien in his daily coffee drinking routines, but Thoreau has an evident concern about the extremes to which his poorer neighbors will undergo to sustain their coffee drinking habits. Thoreau describes another Irish neighbor, John Field, as “an honest, hard-working, but shiftless man plainly,” and Thoreau tried to impart a _want not, waste not_ mentality to Field: “I tried to help [Field] with my experience,” says Thoreau, “telling him that he was one of my nearest neighbors, and that I too, who came a-fishing here, and looked like a loafer, was getting my living like himself; that I lived in a tight, light, and clean house, which hardly cost more than the annual rent of such a ruin as his commonly amounts to; and how, if he chose, he might in a month or two build himself a palace of his own; that I did not use tea, nor coffee, nor butter, nor milk, nor fresh meat, and so did not have to work to get them; again, as I did not work hard, I did not have to eat hard, and it cost me but a trifle for my food; but as he began with tea, and coffee, and butter, and milk, and beef, he had to work hard to pay for them, and when he had worked hard he had to eat hard again to repair the waste of his system — and so it was as broad as it was long, indeed it was broader than it was long, for he was discontented and wasted his life into the bargain: and yet he had rated it as a game in coming to America, that here you could get tea, and coffee, and meat everyday.” A well-paid IT worker today probably needs to think less about the bite the daily cappuccino puts into his budget than John Field had to worry about the financial burden his coffee-drinking placed on him. Still, those who drink several cups of coffee each day to endure the grind of work may be wise to consider Thoreau’s thoughts on how one can become enslaved by his love for coffee. But Thoreau had a more spiritual opposition to coffee which he later describes vaguely. > Like many of my contemporaries, I had rarely for many years used animal food, or tea, or coffee, etc.; not so much because of any ill effects which I had traced to them, as because they were not agreeable to my imagination.,” says Thoreau. “The repugnance to animal food is not the effect of experience, but is an instinct. It appeared more beautiful to live low and fare hard in many respects; and though I never did so, I went far enough to please my imagination. Again, we see not an actual distaste for coffee so much as we see an aversion to what it represents – a luxury imported from foreign places beyond Concord’s borders, an expensive taste that ultimately drains the time and financial resources of those who enjoy it and are unable to deviate from the routine of consuming it. ### The Drink of Champions > I believe that water is the only drink for a wise man; wine is not so noble a liquor; and think of dashing the hopes of a morning with a cup of warm coffee, or of an evening with a dish of tea! Perhaps no better passage in Walden summarizes Thoreau’s emotions about coffee. True to his entire philosophy of living deliberately, Thoreau believed that the Spartan world about him offered him nearly everything he needed – dependence upon purchasing goods from neighbors or luxuries imported from afar was a dangerous and imprisoning habit. He appeared to have little aversion to being an occasional social coffee drinker, especially if the expense was incurred by his company. But joy and contentment, in Thoreau’s Walden world, were something to be drawn from his surroundings. From Walden alone, we cannot determine whether Thoreau viewed coffee as a vice to be resisted for the more ‘natural,’ or as a luxury unworthy of its expense. Were he living simply today, we can feel assured that a visit to his abode would be a strictly _BYOC_ (Bring Your Own Coffee) affair, and it is a mystery whether he would join us for a cup. Regardless, he has given us some food for thought on our favorite drink, and INeedCoffee.com salutes him as the (Anti?) Coffee Achiever.

# Home Coffee Roasting on the Rise [Roasting Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/roasting-coffee/)---by [James Cameron](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/james-cameron/)![Home Coffee Roasting on the Rise](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/home-coffee-roasting-on-the-rise/JimCupping4001.jpg) Thirty years ago, when I first watched the transformation of the little hard odorless green coffee beans go through the metamorphous of becoming that full rich dark brown aromatic delight, I was amazed. I became instantly “hooked” on roasting my own coffee and searching for an even better cup. I wasn’t alone back then when I began my coffee journey, which lead to farms, mills, and a coffee roasting business. We, the pioneers of the Specialty Coffee Industry, were all frantically looking for better beans and ways to roast them even better. We would call each other and tell of a Sumatra that was out of this world. Only 20 bags left so hurry and get some.![JimCupping400](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/JimCupping4001.HAJ1GTmT_BHgGe.webp)_Jim Cupping Coffee_ Fast forward 25 years: Most of the small roasters of the past have sold their businesses, and the larger companies who are more concerned with the bottom line than the quality of the cup are the “Specialty Coffee” suppliers today. The very term; “Specialty Coffee” no longer fits. Every little gas station, convenience store, and many other un-coffee places tout “GOURMET COFFEE”. Supermarkets have 40 feet of “Specialty Coffee” and only 8 feet of R&G (that’s what we call the roast, ground, and canned stuff). The whole bean bagged and bulk coffee is now the standard. The coffee in the United States is much better than it was 30 years ago but it is in the downward cycle as the little guys have either gotten out or been pushed out by the “Big Boys”. This opens up a market for the little guys once again to rise on the virtue of their commitment to quality and freshness. I have no doubt that this will happen and many little companies will spring up and, once again make a difference in the quality of the coffee out there. The home roasting phenomenon is a mixture of a few things. First, people have tasted the nectar and know how good it can be. They cannot find the quality and freshness in the supermarket and Starbucks has pushed the little guy off the corner so you can’t run down to your local coffee shop and buy a pound of freshly roasted beans. The word is out and continues to reach people through articles like this one, that roasting your own coffee is as easy, fun, economical, and produces a cup as you have never tasted. Home hobbies are HOT. Saving money is HOT, and increasingly important. Freshly roasted coffee is becoming extinct. People demand good coffee. There are a number of small home roasting machines available but your oven will work just fine. Raw (green) coffee is readily available through a number of websites. A leading homebrew (beer) magazine recently quoted in an article on home roasting that roasting your own coffee beans is the fastest growing hobby in the USA today. Nationally syndicated author Mary Hunt of cheapskate.com writes often about roasting your own coffee as a way to save money while simultaneously delivering the best cup possible. TIME magazine published an article on the home roasting phenomenon in Feb, 2005. Slowly but surely, people are catching on. I have tried to promote home roasting for 25 years. It has just now taken off to proportions I could not foresee just a couple of years ago. The number of home roasters is still too small to put on paper, maybe 1/100th of 1 percent of coffee drinkers but I know it is multiplying rapidly and will become a household word in a short time. Thirty years ago when I was bringing people their first cup of great coffee the excitement was high. People couldn’t wait to tell their friends about this new coffee called “Gourmet Coffee”. Our business spiked tremendously at Christmas because everyone experiencing great coffee wanted to share it with his or her friends. Home roasting is just starting to go through the same phase where those who have discovered it are excited and telling and showing their friends, and the cycle continues. Just like in the boom of the Specialty Coffee industry 25 years ago, there are pitfalls. There are many non-coffee experts looking to make a fast buck by simply buying a big bag of coffee, cutting it into small bags of coffee, and up charging. Buying, cup testing, and knowing coffee are prerequisites to being in the business of selling raw green coffee to the home roaster. You have to find a reliable source who knows coffee if you expect to get good beans. Believe me, in my 30 years in the industry I have seen some raunchy beans and some of them look really good. No one throws these beans away, they just pass them along. Find a good reliable source who knows how to cup coffee and has a good, long-standing reputation before buying your beans. Become part of this rapidly expanding and exciting new phenomenon and start roasting your own coffee beans. You’ll be the envy of the coffee crown in your area.

# Home (Alone) Roasting [Roasting Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/roasting-coffee/)---by [Michael Allen Smith](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/michael-allen-smith/)![Home (Alone) Roasting](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/home-alone-roasting/space-heater-coffee-roasting.jpg) To roast your own coffee beans at home is quite simple. It is so simple that I wish I had learned it many years ago. All you have to do is measure out some green beans, throw them into a popcorn popper, stir a little, and wait. After a few minutes, you have the freshest coffee of your life. If you would like to learn more about home roasting read [Roasting Coffee in a Popcorn Popper](https://ineedcoffee.com/roasting-coffee-in-a-popcorn-popper/). Roasting from a popcorn popper is done outside, and provided you have good weather, it isn’t a challenge. ### Roasting In a Winter Climate There is an obstacle to home roasting in the winter. The cold wind rushing into your popper cools the beans while they roast. The beans take forever to roast, and the batch usually doesn’t roast evenly. Old Man Winter doesn’t want you to roast coffee outside. You could attempt to bring the popper inside and try and route the smoke outside. My cousin tried this at the University of Cincinnati. After the fire alarm cleared the dormitory, he assured the Fire Chief he would no longer roast coffee indoors. I first learned to roast while living in Florida. I never really paid attention to home roasters when they discussed roasting in the winter. After all, I was living in warm, sunny weather year-round. Little did I know I’d be back north a year later.![patio roasting coffee setup](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/patio-roasting-coffee-setup1.gjvAmmoc_739D.webp)_Patio Roasting Setup_### Lesson #1 – The Hair Drier Could I beat the cold season and continue roasting all winter? I decided to innovate. That was my first mistake. My first idea was to use a hair dryer to heat the top of the popper while roasting. It seemed like a sensible idea at the time. However, all this did was blow chaff and many beans out of the popper.![coffee roasting hair dryer](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/coffee-roasting-hair-dryer.DcwKg8ju_Z23YjWo.webp)_Lesson #1 – Don’t use a hair dryer for home roasting_### Lesson #2 – The Space Heater The first idea was shaky at best, but my next idea had to be a stroke of brilliance. If I aimed a space heater at the roaster, it would simulate a warm area, and the beans would roast just as if I were back in Florida on a summer day. Carefully, I set up the space heater and started roasting. After a minute or so, the space heater shuts off. I reset the power strip and started roasting again. Another minute went by before the power strip shut down again. At this point, I should have realized that I was witnessing some electrical problem, but I continued roasting with the heater going full blast. Then came complete darkness and silence. The power for the entire house failed. Using the space heater outside, the fuse box was blown. Sitting in complete darkness, I learned lesson #2.![patio coffee roasting heater](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/patio-coffee-roasting-heater.Cj0Fy_qB_2pxMQJ.webp)_Lesson #2 – Don’t use a space heater outside to roast coffee._![reset breaker](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/reset-breaker.Ce387qex_ZcbmI0.webp)_This should never be a step in home roasting coffee._### Now What? In _Home Alone_, Kevin successfully uses a winter climate to defeat the bad guys without parental guidance. I couldn’t even roast coffee, let alone fight off bad guys. Without the help of an experienced winter home roaster, I’ll be putting away my popper until next spring. Now I’m left with two choices on what to do for good coffee this winter: 1. Buy a Dedicated Coffee Roaster – This will cost more than a popcorn popper, but I figure it’ll pay for itself by springtime with my coffee. 2. Buy coffee on the Internet – Take the opportunity to try different roasters nationwide. It’s more than likely that I’ll do both. UPDATE: Tim Culver writes: > Great article, Michael. I disagree with your “Lesson #1 – Don’t use a hair dryer for home roasting” though. I have lately found that a hair dryer helps. I set it on low aim it at the intakes at the bottom of my Proctor-Silex Popcorn Pumper. This is the only way I can get to 2nd crack (here in the frozen tundra of North Carolina). UPDATE 2001: In the article [Winter Home Roasting](https://ineedcoffee.com/cold-weather-coffee-roasting/), Ryan Jacobs figured out that using a cardboard box could trap and recycle heat effectively for cold weather roasting.

# Home Roasting Coffee in an Oven [Roasting Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/roasting-coffee/)---by [Michael Allen Smith](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/michael-allen-smith/)![Home Roasting Coffee in an Oven](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/home-roasting-coffee-in-an-oven/Home-Roasting-Coffee-in-an-Oven.jpg) There are many ways to roast coffee at home. One of the most basic and least expensive methods is the oven. Yes, you can easily roast your own coffee at home using an oven. It doesn’t make the brightest, most flavorful coffee, but it works. You may be impressed with the outcome if you’ve never home-roasted coffee. What supplies will you need? 1. A decent oven capable of reaching higher temperatures (more details below). 2. A baking tray or cookie sheet. The best kind will have small perforations, like those used for cooking pizza. 3. Timer or stopwatch. 4. Oven mitt. Due to the high temperatures, an Ove Glove is ideal. 5. Wooden spatula. 6. Metal colander(s) for cooling. 7. Water bottle with mist spray – if you live in a hot climate 8. Green coffee beans. Between 1/3 and 1/2 pounds works best. ### More on the Oven All ovens are different. What the temperature says and what it really is can vary. An ideal oven will be able to reach 470°F – 500°F. It will also have a window for clear visibility during the roasting process. Test your oven to see if it has a working light. If it doesn’t, you should have a flashlight handy. You’ll need that to perform visual inspections during the roast. The time it takes to roast can vary from oven to oven and bean to bean. The last thing an ideal oven will have is excellent ventilation, as roasting coffee produces smoke. ### Preparing the Roast While you prepare the coffee roast, turn on the oven and set it at a high temperature. I’d love to tell you the exact temperature, but it will vary from oven to oven and from gas to electric. To start, try 475F for gas and 500F for electric. I’ll discuss dialing in the temperature later in the article. For oven roasting, I like to use a perforated baking pan. Be careful not to use one with too large holes, as some of the beans will fall into them and then expand during roasting. Spread the green beans over the holes in the pan so that they are one bean deep and touching. Don’t stack the beans on top of each other.![coffee smooth beans](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/coffee-smooth-beans1.BQgrTLm-_1a6SNp.webp)_Smooth green coffee beans over the tray. Note that the tray in this photo is not ideal. The holes turned out to be too large._ In addition to preparing the tray, you’ll also want to be ready for the smoke produced during the roast process. The more coffee you roast and the darker the roast, the more it will smoke. Your oven ventilation may not be enough to keep your smoke detectors from going off. The last thing you want during your first oven roast is a panic attack. Open windows, turn on fans, and if you can, temporarily disable your kitchen smoke detector. Also, alert others in the house about what you are doing. The last step in preparation is coming up with an exit strategy. When the beans come out of the oven, they will be extremely hot and still have chaff on them. Chaff is a thin tissue-like skin that you’ll want to knock off the beans as much as possible before grinding. However, the most important task after roasting is to cool the beans. Your goal is to get the beans down to room temperature as fast as possible to prevent the beans from continuing to roast. I advise creating a path from the oven to the outside or to a patio. This is where you will cool the beans and remove the chaff. More on that later. ### Monitoring the Roast Once you’ve got your tray of beans ready and have both a ventilation and exit strategy, confirm that the oven has been pre-heated, and then place the coffee tray into the oven. Start your timer. The coffee will go from green to yellow, light brown to a darker brown. Color is very important for monitoring the roast. You don’t want to burn the coffee.![Oven Roast Progression](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/oven-roast-progression.DqqBLeyQ_Z1rgiaY.webp)_Oven Roast Progression_ Since not all ovens or baking trays are equal, some beans – especially those on the outside edges – may start roasting faster than others. If you see unevenness in the roast, pull the coffee out and use your wooden spatula to stir the beans. Then quickly place the beans back into the oven. Ideally, this should be done no more than twice during a roast cycle, as each time you open the oven door, the temperature will drop. If your oven struggles to get high temperatures, you may be better off letting it go and picking out the burnt beans later.![Coffee roast with uneven edges.](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/coffee-roast-uneven-edges.BdC_OizE_15uuFC.webp)_Coffee roast with uneven edges. The beans on the outside are roasting faster. If this happens, pull the roast, stir it, and return it to the oven quickly._### Listening to the Roast In addition to watching the color of the coffee beans change, you’ll also be listening. Coffee produces a first crack and if you roast long enough a second crack. The first crack is a popping sound. At first, you’ll hear a few beans and then more. Then the cracks will fade and the coffee beans will be quiet for a few minutes. Then comes the second crack, which is more of a crackling sound. You may end your roast here depending on how you like your coffee. If you like darker roasts, let it go a little longer, but not too much._Listen to the 2nd crack of a coffee roast._[Oven Roasting Coffee The 2nd Crack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rp3GTQmwoP0) (YouTube 18 seconds) ### Typical Roast The downside to roasting coffee in an oven is that you can’t quickly move the temperature up and down. A dedicated coffee roaster will usually start at a lower temperature, and then heat is increased gradually throughout the remainder of the roasting cycle. This allows the coffee to develop more complex flavors. You can’t really do that with an oven, which is why the roast temperature starts and ends high. This means the roast will often be faster than other methods. If your oven is extremely responsive, you can start the roast at a lower temperature and then increase the temperature as the roast progresses. This will enable a longer roast cycle to develop more flavors without burning the coffee. ### Dialing in Your Oven Roasts My roasts with an oven tend to be around 10 minutes. If you can get 15 minutes without burning, that would be great. Anything shorter than 10 minutes and I’d advise dropping the temperature. Take notes on times, temperatures, and of course, taste. Also, ensure you use the same amount of green coffee each time. After a few roasts, you should start to get a feel for your oven. ### Stopping the Roast and Cooling the Beans Once the beans achieve your desired roast, stop the oven and remove them. Use an oven glove or a really good oven mitt. Also, be prepared to be face-to-face with a cloud of smoke. Don’t panic. Take your coffee to where you plan on cooling it. I like going straight outdoors or to a patio, but it isn’t required. Dump the beans from the baking tray into the metal colander. If you live in a very warm climate and there is no breeze, you may need to lightly spray mist water on the beans to cool them down. Don’t drench the beans, just lightly mist the cold water over them. It should evaporate immediately and cool the coffee beans in the process. If your squirt bottle can’t mist, don’t use it. Anything more than a mist will do more harm than good. Be sure to test the mist before using it. Some home roasters disagree with this method, but I’ve used it many times when I lived in Florida and Southern California. Another idea is to roast in the early morning when it is cooler.![coffee cooling](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/coffee-cooling.zG0j6mJX_Z2lGKuQ.webp)_I use two metal colanders to cool the coffee beans quickly._ Once the beans are in the metal colander, shake them gently. I use two metal colanders and pass the beans back and forth, which also knocks the chaff off the beans. ### Oven Roasting Step-by-Step 1. Preheat the oven to 475°F – 500°F or whatever temperature you’ve calculated works best for your oven. 2. Spread the beans over the perforated baking pan so that they are no more than one bean deep. Make sure they are close together. 3. Open windows, turn on vents, alert family members, and possibly disable the kitchen smoke detector. 4. Set up a cooling station with a metal colander, preferably outdoors. 5. (hot climates) Have a spray bottle on mist ready to go. You just want a light mist. Test spray bottle before using. 6. Place the pan into the oven once it is preheated. 7. Monitor the roast for color, sound, and roast evenness. The beans will take about 10-17 minutes to roast. 8. If beans are roasting unevenly, remove them from the oven, stir with a wooden spatula, and quickly return to the oven. 9. Once roasted, turn off the oven, remove the pan, and head to the cooling station. 10. Place the beans into the metal colander and begin (gently) shaking to cool and knock off the chaff. 11. (hot climates) Apply a light mist with your water bottle. 12. Let the house be clear of smoke. Using a floor fan will accelerate this process. 13. Apologize to any firefighters who may have arrived at your home. ![:)](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/icon_smile.KCokMNme_Z1n5p4u.webp) 14. Enable the smoke detector and confirm the oven has been turned off. 15. Allow 24-48 hours for beans to degas before brewing. (Decaf coffee can be brewed immediately. It’ll also roast faster. Lighter-roasted _coffee will take longer than 48 hours to develop fully. )_### Conclusion How much you enjoy oven-roasting coffee will depend on your environment and how picky you are about your coffee flavors. Kenneth Davids, the author of _Home Coffee Roasting: Romance & Revival_, states that oven roasting isn’t best for very light or dark roasts. Ovens tend not to roast the beans as evenly as other methods. When I roasted coffee from a small apartment using an electric oven, my coffee tasted flat, and my apartment was filled with smoke for 30 minutes. [My cat](https://ineedcoffee.com/my-cat-kato-vs-the-kona-coffee-plant/) was not amused. Then, when I tried using a new gas oven in a larger kitchen, my results were much better. Will it work for you? Give it a try and find out. ### Resources [Roasting Coffee in a Popcorn Popper](https://ineedcoffee.com/roasting-coffee-in-a-popcorn-popper/) – A better way to roast coffee at home is with an old popcorn popper.

# Roast Oolong Tea at Home [Tea](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/tea/)---by [Michael Allen Smith](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/michael-allen-smith/)![Roast Oolong Tea at Home](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/home-roasting-oolong-tea/Roast-Oolong-Tea-at-Home.jpg) Many coffee drinkers like roasted oolong tea. It shares some characteristics with coffee, such as nuttiness and a rich body. And just like coffee, how long the tea is roasted greatly influences its taste. Last year, I decided to experiment with roasting my own oolong tea. After all, I’ve been home roasting coffee since 1998. Why not roast tea as well? Before we dive into the roasting, let me cover what oolong tea is for those who might only be familiar with green and black teas. A simple definition is that green tea is a tea that has not been oxidized (0%), whereas black tea is a tea that has been fully oxidized (100%). Oolong tea represents the middle ground, otherwise known as semi-oxidized tea. The Tea Processing page on Wikipedia states: > This tea’s oxidation is stopped somewhere between the standards for green tea and black tea. The processing typically takes two to three days from withering to drying with a relatively short oxidation period of several hours. The oxidation percentage of oolong tea can be low or high. The lower oxidized teas tend to be brighter, and the higher oxidized ones have a richer body, which is closer to black teas. Many tea drinkers, myself included, gravitate towards oolongs. We love the flavors and fragrances typically not found in green and black teas. That is the basic explanation of oolongs. I’ve added links in the reference section below for those wishing to learn more.![Oolong tea](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/oolong-tea1.DKT9WCPD_r2Jsv.webp)_Oolong Tea_### To Refresh, To Roast Oolong teas like other perishable items can go stale over time and lose flavor. Tea can also absorb the odors that surround them if stored improperly. If a tea started with a good flavor and has gone flat, a short lower temperature roast can bring it back to life. This is called _refreshing_ the tea. Although each tea will vary depending on age and oxidation level, a basic refresh recipe is roasting it in the oven at 200 F for 20 minutes. I learned that as wonderful as the refresh technique is, you can’t bring back to life a tea that is too stale or never had a great flavor to begin with. Once the refresh portion is complete, you can proceed to the roast. This involves slowly increasing the temperature. How long you roast the tea is up to you. If you like the “roasty” flavor, take the roast longer. I like to find the balance between the bright characteristics of the oolong and the toasty flavors that develop during the roast. ### Time to Roast Some Oolong Tea To roast oolong tea at home, you only need an oven, a cookie sheet, and some oolong tea. To get started, I recommend using a lighter, affordable oolong, such as a Jade oolong. Starting from something light and bright and moving toward a darker, toastier tea will highlight the differences you will get during the roasting process. It is perfectly acceptable to pull out tea at different points and brew it up during the roast. I encourage you to do that. During the roast, I will pull the tea out of the oven a few times and stir it so the roasting is even. A typical oolong roast profile will start at a low temperature and gradually increase. If you have experience home roasting coffee, my advice is to relax and be patient. Roasting tea takes much longer than coffee. When I first started roasting, I focused too much on creating an optimal temperature profile. Because every tea is different, it is better to learn to focus on color and smell. By the way, the smell of roasting oolong tea is amazing. Pull samples during the roast and brew. You’ll learn quickly how _roasty_ you like your tea, and if you under-roast something, you can always roast it longer later. Step Temp F Minutes Profile 1 200 20 2 225 15 3 240 15 4 265 15 A 5 275 15 B 6 285 15 C In the table above, I used three roast profiles (A, B, and C) for my Jade Oolong. Your times will most likely differ depending on the oolong you roast, your oven, and your personal taste preference. Using the table is to start at the first row and work down the table, adjusting the temperature for the specified time. With each step, the temperature is increased. Don’t forget to pull the tea out of the oven and stir periodically. This will ensure the roast is even.![roasting operation](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/roasting-operation.CNhdxgf3_1ni5ko.webp)_This was my setup for determining tea roast profiles._### Final Words Like home coffee roasting, you can buy a dedicated tea roaster to explore this hobby. I know some tea shops that have their mini bamboo tea roasters. They do better than oven roasting, but a cookie sheet is fine if you roast small batches of tea.

# Home Coffee Roasting – Getting Started [Roasting Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/roasting-coffee/)---by [Stefanie Spencer](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/stefanie-spencer/)![Home Coffee Roasting – Getting Started](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/home-roasting-getting-started/green-coffee-espresso-blend-71.jpg) Roasting your own coffee at home can be a challenging and satisfying hobby, and getting started does not have to be expensive. First I am going to discuss some different options for acquiring unroasted coffee beans, and later I will discuss some common methods of roasting at home, everything from using your kitchen oven to the small-batch Behmor drum roaster. Green coffee beans are imported from all over the world in large quantities to wholesalers, usually on pallets containing many 100-150 pound burlap sacks. Purchasing coffee directly from a wholesaler/importer is much cheaper than a reseller, say $1.50 per pound, but the large quantity required is usually beyond the scope of a single person, so finding a good reseller or distributor is a necessity. The simplest way is to find a local roaster or coffee shop. There are a few local shops in Cochise County and, of course, many in Tucson. Savaya Coffee, on the southwest corner of Broadway and Craycroft, has a large selection of extremely high-quality green coffees. Since they are a coffee shop, you can also taste what they have roasted before you decide on what to buy. Green coffee prices can vary greatly depending on the quality, and at Savaya prices are in the $7.00/lb. to $10.00/lb. range. Another option is to make your purchase from an online reseller. This could save some money, and usually, they provide plenty of information on the beans. _Sweet Maria’s_ has a huge selection and also provides a wealth of information on home roasting. Their prices start at about $5.00/lb. and go down if you purchase a higher quantity. They provide detailed cupping notes on every coffee and usually notes about the farm, too. They have traveled all over the world to almost every farm they work with, just check out the “Coffee Travels” section.![Sweet Maria&amp;#x27;s Espresso Workshop #7](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/green-coffee-espresso-blend-71.SA8azNIA_ZslQpY.webp)_Sweet Maria’s Espresso Workshop #7_ Lastly, an interesting way to acquire green beans is to join an [online coffee co-op](https://ineedcoffee.com/meeting-up-with-the-green-coffee-buying-club/). A co-op is a group of people that pool their money to purchase a 100-150 pound bag and volunteer their time to separate it into smaller bags to ship to the members. In the forums, there is usually some info on the cupping profile of the beans; however, it is important to research what you are getting to make sure you get the appropriate quality for the price you are paying. The best part of the co-op is the price of the beans – which can be as low as $1.50 or $2.00 per pound. You are paying only for the wholesale coffee, PayPal fees, bags, and shipping. The negatives with this option are, since they do not stock any coffee, new beans only become available after harvest time and there isn’t a “customer service dept,” it is a volunteer trying to do the best they can in their spare time. After purchasing the green, unroasted coffee beans, it’s time to decide how to roast those beans. Coffee roasting can sound complicated, but really it is as simple as taking the beans to a temperature between 400°F and 480°F. You can purchase special appliances that do everything almost automatically, or you can use your kitchen oven. Coffee peaks in flavor 24 hours to 7 days after it is roasted, so roasting at home lets you enjoy the coffee when it is at its best. The majority of purchased coffee is available many days past that after it has spent that first 7 days in a freight truck or sitting on the shelf. The least expensive way to get started is by using your [kitchen oven](https://ineedcoffee.com/home-roasting-coffee-in-an-oven/); if you happen to have a convection oven, that is even better. It does need to be an oven that cooks evenly and can really put out the heat, as you will need to preheat it to 500°F or even 530°F if it will go that high. The beans need to be in a perforated pan, vegetable steamer, or colander/strainer, something that will allow air to flow around and through the beans. If you are using a vegetable steamer, like the ones that have the leaves that fold out, place it on a cookie sheet. Once you place the beans in the oven watch until they nearly reach the desired color and level of roast because they will continue to darken a bit after they are taken out. If this takes more than 20 minutes then the oven temperature needs to be raised. If you are roasting in the colander, quickly open the oven and shake the beans around every few minutes while they are roasting. After removing the beans, quickly cool them down by dumping them into a strainer and then stirring them with a wooden spoon while blowing on them lightly to help remove the chaff (this is the thin, parchment-like skin that comes off of the beans during roasting). A great way to keep them fresh is in a glass jar, but leave the lid slightly loose for the first few days as they will need to vent out CO2, also keep the jar out of direct sunlight. Another method that is very simple, not expensive, and produces great consistent results is a hot air popcorn popper such as the [West Bend Poppery](https://ineedcoffee.com/roasting-coffee-in-a-popcorn-popper/). The average price is about $30, but sometimes you can even purchase these in thrift stores for next to nothing. You will also need one or two colanders, a bowl to catch the chaff, a wooden spoon, and some oven mitts. Set the popper in a well-lit and well-ventilated place, preferably outside if the weather permits. Put the same amount of beans in the popper that the manufacturer recommends for the popcorn, for the West Bend popper it is 2/3 to 3/4 cup. Place the hood and butter dish in place, point the chute over the large bowl, and turn the unit on. In about 3 minutes you should hear the “first crack” of the beans, closely watch the color, and smell the fragrance. When the beans almost reach your desired roast, in approximately 4 to 6 minutes of roast time, pour them out into the colander. They will continue to darken a little as they cool off, and either stir with the spoon or toss them back and forth between the colanders to help cool them off quickly and remove the chaff. Again, put them in the glass jar, leaving the lid slightly loose, and let them rest for at least 24 hours. To make the process and the clean-up even easier, there are nearly automatic hot air roasters like the [Hearthware iRoast 2](https://ineedcoffee.com/i-roast-2-coffee-roasting-guide/), costing about $179. Like the popcorn popper, it uses hot air to roast the beans, but it has many features that are specific to coffee roasting. You can set the exact temperatures that you would like it to roast at and store the profiles in the unit’s memory for future use. The top lid/cover assembly contains two screens to collect the chaff, making clean up incredibly easy; just remove the screen and empty it into the trash can, no mess. The sides of the roasting chamber are glass for easy viewing of the beans, and once they reach the desired roast you press the “COOL” button, starting its cool down cycle. At this time, I usually remove the coffee from the chamber and cool it off in a colander, which seems to be faster than the cooling cycle. Another benefit is that it can hold about 1 cup of green beans, which is slightly more than the popcorn popper.![iroast2 coffee roaster](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/iroast2-coffee-roaster.yp1mBe_b_XPP9S.webp)_Photo [I-Roast 2 from the I-Roast 2 Coffee Roasting Guide](https://ineedcoffee.com/i-roast-2-coffee-roasting-guide/) by Chris Arnold_ The next step up would be a small batch drum roaster like the [Behmor 1600](https://ineedcoffee.com/behmor-1600-coffee-roaster-tutorial/) for about $300. Its main feature is its larger capacity, which is up to 1 lb!!!; its quietness, making it easier to hear the “first crack” and “second crack” of the beans; and smoke reducing secondary heating element. It also has the same features of programming in profiles, a cooling cycle, and a glass viewing window. It is rated for up to 900 1 lb. batches, but with good care, it is said to last much, much longer. Roasting your own coffee can be a very satisfying hobby, and giving the gift of home-roasted coffee to your friends and family for Christmas will be something they can savor throughout the holidays.

# Home Roasting Coffee with the Fresh Roast [Roasting Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/roasting-coffee/)---by [Michael Allen Smith](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/michael-allen-smith/)![Home Roasting Coffee with the Fresh Roast](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/home-roasting-coffee-with-the-fresh-roast/fr_roast3.jpg) *This tutorial was written in 2000. Since then there have been updates to the Fresh Roast coffee roaster. * There are many ways to roast coffee at home. INeedCoffee has many home roasting tutorials using a popcorn popper, Hearthware Precision, and an oven. Now, I’m about to show the easiest method of them all: the Fresh Roast Coffee Bean Roaster. The Fresh Roast is a small-batch coffee roaster that runs off electricity. Just plug it in and roast. Is it the right roaster for you? We’ll look into that after I walk you through a roasting session. ### About the Fresh Roast The Fresh Roast can roast 2-2.5 oz of green coffee beans per batch, which yields enough for about 10-12 cups of coffee. If you and your household consume a lot of coffee, then a larger capacity roaster may be more appropriate. The roast completes in a very fast 3-5 minutes. It is also the quietest roaster I’ve used. The pictures below were all taken from an outside patio, but this roaster can easily work indoors. As with any indoor roasting, make sure you have proper ventilation and you can disable the smoke detector.![FreshRoast - Pre Roast](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/fr_portrait118x200.CUJSwoKB_2dLzos.webp)_FreshRoast – Pre Roast_![FreshRoast - Post Roast](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/fr_portrait_done118x200.BZTu5sYm_a6RM2.webp)_FreshRoast – Post Roast_### Starting The Roast Telling someone how to roast with a Fresh Roast is like teaching someone how to make toast. To say it is simple is an understatement. Pour in the green coffee beans, set the toggle to either “LIGHT” or “DARK”, close the lid, and turn the timer. Now, just let the roaster do its job. That’s all there is to roasting with the Fresh Roast.![Add Beans](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/fr_load200x1511.B-kknI-9_1Nv3Mu.webp)_Add Beans_![Set Timer](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/fr_timer.CQvJ1TZf_Z1Kia0f.webp)_Set Timer_![Start of Roast](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/fr_ready200x151.IIoYcjkf_2kX2b6.webp)_Start of Roast_![Early in the Roast](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/fr_roast1.Bh9-wX4U_Z1lOPkx.webp)_Early in the Roast_![Middle of Roast](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/fr_roast2.XwdNWz95_tXDm8.webp)_Middle of Roast_![End of Roast](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/fr_roast3.BCjR6ANa_htCnU.webp)_End of Roast_### Ending The Roast The one drawback I found to the Fresh Roast is that it doesn’t do a great job of cooling down. Because of this, I suggest using an oven mitt or towel to remove the lid once the roast is complete. Usually, the first roast isn’t exceptionally hot, but each subsequent roast gets hotter. Once the machine has cooled off, empty the chaff basket.![Remove the Lid](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/fr_remove_lid122x151.DDhoNJSK_TFdBN.webp)_Remove the Lid_![Pour out the Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/fr_pour122x151.xQ1HcJnK_ZUyupp.webp)_Pour out the Coffee_![finished roast](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/fr_both.6vkvAzo-_Z16Ukuw.webp)_The coffee on the left was roasted on the “LIGHT” setting, and the coffee on the right was roasted on the “DARK” setting._ Some roasters may desire to monkey with their Fresh Roast machine to get the roast to slow down or accelerate the cooling of the beans. That’s beyond the scope of this article, but if you are looking for an easy way to get started in home-roasting coffee, the Fresh Roast is a great product. Home roasters who prefer a more slowly roasted coffee or something that can handle a larger volume would not be ideal users of this roaster.

# Home Roasting with the Hearthware Precision [Roasting Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/roasting-coffee/)---by [Michael Allen Smith](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/michael-allen-smith/)![Home Roasting with the Hearthware Precision](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/home-roasting-with-the-hearthware-precision/cool_it.jpg) To anyone who owns a Precision Hearthware Coffee Roaster, the thought of writing a tutorial on using it will seem ridiculous. Using the Hearthware is so simple that even a caveman could figure out the basics. This tutorial is written for coffee fans who haven’t started home roasting yet or those already roasting and who know little about Hearthware. In another INeedCoffee tutorial, we showed you [how to roast coffee using a popcorn popper](https://ineedcoffee.com/roasting-coffee-in-a-popcorn-popper/). If using a popper is as easy as making spaghetti, then using the Hearthware Precision is as simple as using a toaster. Are you ready to see how simple it is to make the best coffee in your home?![hearthware](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/hearthware1.CN3FXxd-_1xXDek.webp) ### Disable Smoke Detector The most difficult part of indoor roasting is disabling the smoke detector. Roasting coffee will produce smoke, and dark roasts even more so. Since the mission here is not to test your smoke detector and kitchen ventilation but to roast coffee, you will want to disable the smoke detector before roasting. ### Add Beans The machine comes with a 1/2-cup scoop. Fill the scoop with beans and pour them into the machine.![pouring beans](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/pouring_beans.DhtiJ2fN_ZgoWBv.webp) ### Start Roasting The roaster only has three controls. One is to start, which is called “Roast.” One is to end, which is titled “Cool.” The third control is a dial that goes from 1 to 10. This will indicate the level of roasting. The higher the number, the longer the roast, and the darker the beans will get. Using the “Cool” stop will always stop a roast regardless of how high you set the roast setting dial. I advise beginners to set the dial to 8 and use the “Cool” button to stop the roast when it reaches the desired level. Be forewarned: If you don’t hit “Cool,” the roast will roast approximately 1.5 minutes longer than the dial setting. As you get more experience with different types of beans, you will start using the dial to control the roast. To start the roast, hit “Roast.”![early roast](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/early_roast.rW1qnq_0_ZTT1Ug.webp) ### Check with the Experts Even though this machine doesn’t require “hands-on” attention, you will get the best results by monitoring the progress of each roast. When monitoring the roast, you will hear the “first crack” and, if roasted long enough, the “second crack”. How long should you roast a bean? This depends upon your taste, but consulting a cupper review is a great idea if you are open to all roasting levels. Using the cupper’s advice is optional. A cupper is a coffee professional trained to taste and report the distinctions of each coffee. A cupper will dissect a crop of beans and find its strengths and then advise a roasting level that will best complement that bean. For example, Brazil Santos tastes great as a Full City or Vienna Roast, whereas you would roast Hawaiian Kona lighter. I get all my cupping reviews from Sweet Maria’s—their green bean page links directly to each crop’s cupping review. The bean roasted in this tutorial is _Costa Rican Tarrazu La Minita_. Sweet Maria advises that it should be roasted “… through the first crack and NOT into or even to the first snap of the second crack. That’s where it is at its peak! ”![cool roast](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/cool_it.CfcDigbc_Z1cHuk7.webp) ### Collecting The Bounty After the time expires or the “Cool” button is hit, the roaster will undergo a cool cycle, which will take approximately as long as the roast itself. Once that has been completed, pour the beans into your storage container. They will be ready for brewing in about 12-24 hours after they have had a chance to degas. Resist the urge to brew immediately. ### Wrapping Up The last step is to clean out the chaff collector (the lid). Precision provides a small toothbrush for cleaning out the chaff collected during the roasting process. Brush away the chaff. This is a helluva lot easier than cleaning the George Foreman Grill after cooking salmon! Don’t forget to get your smoke detector operational again after you’re finished roasting and the smoke has cleared. ### Conclusion The Hearthware Precision Coffee Roaster is the greatest purchase I’ve ever made. The coffee I’m producing at home is on par with or superior to that of the best commercial roasters. If the $130 price tag scares some consumers, note that this machine will pay for itself. Personally, I drink one pound of coffee a week. If green beans average $5 a pound and commercially roasted coffee averages $10 a pound, then it will take 26 weeks for the machine to pay for itself. The popcorn popper solution is still the cheapest, but if you are like me and live [in a cold winter environment,](https://ineedcoffee.com/cold-weather-coffee-roasting/) then having an indoor roaster like the Precision is a real treat.

# Homemade Coffee Ice Cream Recipe [Recipes](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/coffee-recipes/)---by [Michael Allen Smith](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/michael-allen-smith/)![Homemade Coffee Ice Cream Recipe](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/homemade-coffee-ice-cream-recipe/homemade-coffee-ice-cream.jpg) Over ten years ago, I tried to make homemade ice cream. I forgot the name of the ice cream maker, but it was terrible. It took way too long, required adding lots of ice, and the result had an awful texture. Since then, I’ve been buying all my ice cream, but recently I had a chance to play with the Cuisinart ICE-21 Ice Cream Maker. It is awesome. I expected a little learning curve, but there wasn’t one. Immediately, I was making amazing ice cream.![ice cream maker](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/ice-cream-maker.D-dwbT0T_DUp6u.webp)*Cuisinart Ice Cream Maker - After a few batches of vanilla ice cream, I started working on coffee ice cream. Not surprisingly, coffee ice cream is my favorite flavor. But I don’t like all coffee ice creams. I like the coffee ice creams where coffee plays a supporting role and is not the dominant flavor. I also don’t like dark-roasted coffee ice creams. The reason is that it can impart an ashy, bitter flavor that distracts from the creaminess and sweetness of the ice cream. Coffee ice cream recipes use instant coffee or concentrated brewed coffee. As someone who has been home roasting coffee since 1998 and is a huge quality coffee enthusiast, I thought I would not like instant coffee, but I did. Instant coffee is something I would never drink, but for coffee ice cream, it just works. The basic flavor of the instant coffee was ideal, and the texture of the ice cream remained perfect. Let us make some coffee ice cream. We will be using the _Cuisinart ICE-21 Frozen Yogurt-Ice Cream & Sorbet Maker_. You can use this recipe for other ice cream makers, but you might need to adjust the recipe portions. Check your manual. ### Ingredients - 1 cup whole milk - 3/4 cup of granulated white sugar - 1.5 tablespoons of instant coffee - 2 cups heavy cream - 2 teaspoons of vanilla extract I used the 100% Colombian Instant Coffee sold by Trader Joe’s. I can vouch for this instant coffee. If you use Starbucks VIA, pick their Colombian instead of the French Roast. If you prefer a stronger coffee taste, double the amount of instant coffee added to 3 tablespoons. I used regular granulated white sugar for my coffee ice cream, but there are other options. Some recipes call for splitting the amount of sugar equally between white sugar and brown sugar. And our [Coconut Milk Coffee Ice Cream](https://ineedcoffee.com/coconut-milk-coffee-ice-cream-recipe/) recipe gives the tip to use rice syrup if you find the ice cream too hard after a day in the freezer.![ice cream supplies](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/ice-cream-supplies.DNXhPjpj_21TQu3.webp)_Coffee ice cream ingredients_ This tutorial will use three bowls. 1. The insulated freezer bowl that comes with the Cuisinart. 2. A mixing bowl for all the ingredients. 3. A storage bowl for the final ice cream. You don’t have to use a bowl here. ### #1 Freeze the Insulated Freezer Bowl Instead of adding a bag of ice to the spinning ice cream maker, the Cuisinart ICE-21 has a double-insulated freezer bowl. No ice is needed. It just needs to spend some time in the freezer first. From the manual: > In general, freezing time is between 6 hours and 22 hours. To determine whether the bowl is completely frozen, shake it. If you do not hear liquid moving, the cooling liquid is frozen. Before freezing, wash and dry the bowl. Wrap it in a plastic bag to prevent freezer burn. We recommend that you place the freezer bowl in the back of your freezer where it is coldest. If you make a lot of ice cream, you can purchase an additional freezer bowl without buying a new ice cream maker. ### #2 Mix Up Ingredients and Chill In a mixing bowl, combine 1 cup of milk and 3/4 cup of sugar. You can use a hand blender, a whisk, or even a spoon. Once the sugar is dissolved, add the instant coffee, vanilla extract, and heavy cream. Mix everything together. Cover and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.![mix ice cream](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/mix-ice-cream.g9SmvSwR_DVgg8.webp)_Mix the ingredients_### #3 Make the Ice Cream Take the freezer bowl out of the freezer and place it on the Cuisinart stand. Place the mixing arm inside the bowl and then cover with the easy lock lid. Once the lid is secured, turn on the ice cream maker. Take the mixing bowl out of the refrigerator and pour it slowly into the ice cream maker. Let the machine run for about 20-30 minutes. Once the texture looks good, stop the machine. Take off the lid and the mixing arm. Transfer the ice cream to another container. I used a glass food storage container, which I kept in the freezer while the ice cream machine was working.![ice cream maker cusinart](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/ice-cream-maker-cusinart.C_TKKifO_Z2ed6R6.webp)_Making coffee ice cream_![mixing the ice cream](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/mixing-the-ice-cream.Dx-ngyG1_Z2uqv5L.webp)_Once the texture looks good, stop the ice cream maker._### #4 Place the Ice Cream in the Freezer (optional) At the end of the 20-30 minute cycle, the ice cream will be soft. If you like the ice cream this way, begin eating it. However, I preferred the taste and texture after it had been in the freezer for another two hours.![ice cream done](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/ice-cream-done.CLd_hwNt_ZeXJ32.webp)_Finished coffee ice cream_### #5 Enjoy Serve and enjoy. I’ve had a lot of coffee ice cream, and this turned out to be one of my favorites. Unlike many of the coffee ice creams sold in the store, the ingredient list was simple. Making your own ice cream does take time, but the benefit is that you control the ingredients and their portions. Plus, it is cool. ### More Creamy! If you prefer an ice cream that is softer and creamier, add a small amount of either vodka or rum to the mix. From the article [Tips for Making Homemade Ice Cream Softer](https://www.davidlebovitz.com/tips-for-making-1/): > Alcohol doesn’t freeze, which you know if you’re anything like me and keep a bottle of vodka chilled and ready in your freezer. You can add up to 3 tablespoons of 40 proof liquor to 1 quart (1 liter) of your frozen dessert mixture prior to churning. I use vodka if I don’t want the taste of the liquor to intrude on the flavor, but will switch to another liquor such as Grand Marnier or Armagnac to enhance the original flavor if it’s compatible. ### Bonus: Coffee Milkshakes and Coffee Malts Now that you have your coffee ice cream, you could make a milkshake or a malt. Add three scoops of ice cream and a few ounces of milk to a blender to make a milkshake. There is no need to add ice cubes. A milkshake can become a malt when you add malt powder to the blend. ### Resources [Coconut Milk Coffee Ice Cream](https://ineedcoffee.com/coconut-milk-coffee-ice-cream-recipe/) – For those who want to make coffee ice cream without dairy.

# Hosting a Coffee Party [Cafe Culture](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/cafe-culture/)---by [Michael Allen Smith](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/michael-allen-smith/)![Hosting a Coffee Party](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/hosting-a-coffee-party/eva-solo-cafe-solo1.jpg) As much as I love the coffee shops in Seattle, sometimes I want to meet up with friends and family at home. I still want the coffee, though. Compared to wine or other luxury items, high-quality home coffee is inexpensive. You will need to pick the ideal coffee and brewing method for your coffee party. What is the ideal coffee? Knowing your guests well lets you know if they prefer lighter or darker roasts. You may even know if they prefer African to South American coffees. However, if you don’t know your guests’ tastes, I would recommend going with Sumatra. I learned in Starbucks Coffee College that it is their best-selling bean. Sumatra has a bold, smooth flavor, and it pairs extremely well with food. You should also have a decaf blend option for your guests. What about espresso? If you plan on making lattes and Americanos, then most blends from good roasters will work. I [home roast coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/buying-your-first-home-coffee-roaster/) and have developed many blends that work well as straight shots and inside lattes. When entertaining guests, I tend to avoid the fruity, high-note espressos. ### Picking a Coffee Brewing Method As much as I love making espresso drinks and practicing latte art for my milk-drinking friends, it is not ideal once you get past a few friends. It is too labor-intensive and too loud. You end up spending the entire party grinding coffee and frothing milk. Here at INeedCoffee, we know more about coffee brewing methods than most coffee drinkers. Why not show your guests something cool? Put away that drip coffee pot. Here are four coffee brewing methods to impress your guests at your coffee party. ### The Chemex The Chemex is a glass container that uses a paper filter. It produces a cup of coffee that tastes as good as the best drip coffee makers on the market. It is simple and beautiful. My tutorial on this brewing method is [Chemex Coffee Brewing – History and Tutorial](https://ineedcoffee.com/chemex-coffee-brewing-history-and-tutorial/). ### The Eva Solo Years ago, someone gave me an [Eva Solo](https://ineedcoffee.com/eva-solo-coffee-brewing-tutorial/) right before I moved to Seattle. I put the coffee brewer into a box and did not pull it out until recently. It is now my favorite coffee brewer. It is a glass container with an insulated cover. Unlike a French Press, where the filter is pushed down before pouring, Eva Solo filters on the pour. The super fine filter is attached to the top. This is an oversimplified explanation, but let me state that it makes a clean, rich cup of coffee.![Eva Solo Cafe Solo](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/eva-solo-cafe-solo1.BakFWcP2_ZbqWkP.webp)_Eva Solo Cafe Solo Coffee Maker Designer Coffee – 1.0 L_  ### The Vac-Pot The vacuum pot is the coffee brewing method that will draw the most attention. Water is at the bottom, and coffee is at the top. Add heat until the water makes contact with the coffee.

# Homebrewing: Espresso Stout [Recipes](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/coffee-recipes/)---by [Ryan Jacobs](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/ryan-jacobs/)![Homebrewing: Espresso Stout](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/homebrewing-espresso-stout/homebrewing-espresso-stout.jpg) Beer has a lot in common with coffee. Both are very popular beverages. Both have the utilitarian consumers of the beverages as well as those who consider themselves connoisseurs. And both of these can be made in a fairly easy fashion at home yielding very positive results. And, interestingly enough, certain types of beers are well complemented by coffee. I will be sharing a recipe I created that is an espresso stout using home-roasted espresso. ### The Coffee/Beer Connection As a homebrewer who also happens to be obsessed with coffee, I found that too many of the coffee or espresso-flavored stout recipes I found seemed to consider coffee more of an afterthought than an important factor in the success of the beverage. I have always found it odd that brewers would take so much time to pick out just the right hops, yeast, and perfect water chemistry, only to say something so general as, “Add a pound of cracked coffee to the brew pot.” Lightly cracking coffee is supposed to compensate for the longer extraction time in the brew, but over-extracted coffee is as undesirable in the beer as it would be on its own. Some homebrewer recipes even go as far as advising instant coffee as an ingredient. This is intolerable advice. Over a few years, I have tried several methods, and the one I most enjoyed is the one that I am about to share. The basic ingredients for making beer are water, sugar, hops, and yeast. Varying the amounts and individual qualities of each basic ingredient will yield a different tasting beverage. The basic equipment a homebrewer needs are: - Boiling Kettle - Fermenting Tank (Carboy) - Racking Equipment (Cane, Tubing, Bottle Filler) - Bottles - Caps - Bottle Capper ### Brewing In a Nutshell At a very high level, these are the basics of homebrewing: 1. **Sanitation** – Everything you touch can be contaminated with bacteria which can cause skunked beer. Sanitize everything that will come in contact with your beer before or after boiling. Using sanitary handling practices is at the top of my list for brewing. The best crafted/designed beer can be ruined by a failure to keep it clean. 2. **Make the Wort** – In this step, you are cooking malts in order to break down their sugars and extract them to create a sweetened liquid. The sugary liquid is what will be consumed by the yeast later. This is achieved by adding water and malt/malt extract into the boiling kettle. Since most small homebrewers don’t have kettles large enough to hold five gallons, the wort is actually concentrated, which means we will add cold water later to make up for the full volume. 3. **Add the Hops** – This is actually part of creating the wort. Depending on your recipe, you will add a series of hops at different times into the boil. Hops serve the purpose of bittering the beer to counteract the sweet taste of the sugary malt. They also are a mild astringent, which helps to keep the bacteria content low. Finally, they provide aroma and flavor to the beverage. The hop additions are generally classified as either ‘Bittering’ or ‘Aroma’ hops. The bittering hops go in earliest because the aromatic compounds of the hops will boil out. Aroma hops go in the boil last so as to preserve those compounds so they will stay in the beer. 4. **Chill the Wort** – This is to be done as quickly as possible. The temperature of your wort should be close to the fermenting temperature listed for the yeast that you chose. Basically, we are trying to cool it to the point that it won’t kill the yeast. A trick that I use is to keep water in the refrigerator; I will be adding this water to the concentrate so that it helps to bring down the overall temperature quicker. 5. **Pitch the Yeast** – This is simply adding the yeast to the wort. Once this step is complete, it is no longer wort, it is beer. 6. **Primary Fermentation** – This is the process of allowing the yeast to consume the sugar in a sanitized environment. When yeast eats the sugar and metabolizes it, two very important molecules are given off: Alcohol and Carbon Dioxide. In primary fermentation, we are concerned with creating alcohol and letting the CO2 out. This is done by affixing an airlock on the carboy which lets gas escape due to pressure but doesn’t let anything in. After taking some measurements, you can find out when fermentation is complete. 7. **Secondary Fermentation** – This step is not necessary if you keg your beer. However, if you bottle your beer, this step is important. In this step, a very calculated amount of unhopped wort is created and added back to the beer. This will create more CO2 and alcohol, but since we are bottling the beer next, the gas will be trapped in the bottle which serves to carbonate it. 8. **Bottling** – This involves putting the beer into bottles and capping the bottles with a capper. 9. **Consumption** – Enjoy your creation and share it with your friends. As is true with coffee, looking past the basics of homebrewing can be very confusing indeed. If you have the patience and the initiative, it can be every bit as rewarding as your coffee hobby. For the already experienced homebrewer, tweak this recipe as much as you like and have fun. For the newbie, stick to this recipe the first time until you become familiar with the basic procedure. ### Our example: Espresso Stout This homebrew combines the flavors of a chocolate-style stout with freshly brewed espresso to kick it up a notch. I also used espresso which I roasted and brewed myself. I fully believe that the overall fresh taste of this brew has everything to do with using quality ingredients — especially the espresso. For this recipe, I used a custom-blended espresso designed for this stout. ### The Espresso Blend Blending coffee is not altogether different from selecting the hop additions for a beer. The goal is certainly the same: to attain a certain flavor by utilizing the different characteristics of the ingredients in specific manners. Just as bittering hops will provide the base bittering for your hops, so does select a base bean for espresso to serve the same purpose in your blend. Beyond normal espresso blending, you should consider the purpose for which the espresso will be used. Will it be used primarily in milk-based drinks, Americanos, straight-up, or in a stout? Since the stout is a chocolate stout, it makes sense to try and complement that flavor with the espresso. You will notice that this blend isn’t extremely dark or oily for an espresso, but as far as espresso goes, I have never found extremely oily blends to be particularly good. Furthermore, this brewed espresso will be added to five gallons of beer! It turns out that excess oils added to beer kill the head retention and thus the overall body of the beer. Needless to say, a very oily stout is not very desirable. Here is my espresso recipe: - **50% Brazil Cerrado** – This will be the base for our espresso. It has a wonderful body to complement the chocolate flavors in the stout, as well as is relatively low in acidity, which will help in keeping this on the palate a little bit longer. This will be roasted past the second crack or until oil shows. - **10% India Monsooned Malabar** – This bean will work very well to help balance the sweetness we will introduce with the Ethiopian bean. It also has some very powerful, yet quick finishing flavor characteristics which I quite like in my espresso. It is roasted to full city. - **10% Guatemala Huehuetenango** – Carries and brightens the other flavors. Roasting this bean just past the second crack tends to tame the more fruity characteristics of this bean. Still, the liveliness of this bean remains and it’s now relatively neutral characteristics help enhance the rest of the blend. - **20% Ethiopian Harrar Horse** – Provides a powerful flavor with floral and chocolatey notes. I will roast this a bit past full-city. - **10% Kenya AA** – Roasted full city, this coffee has extremely powerful flavor characteristics which shine through nicely in our blend. I have always thought of Kenyan AA beans as being somewhat winey and the same is true for hops. This bean, in my mind, makes the bridge between the espresso flavoring and the hop flavoring of the stout. You should feel free to try another espresso blend after you see how this one turns out. The important thing is that by roasting it yourself, you know exactly how old and how fresh the coffee is. Just like hop varieties vary from year to year and crop to crop — so do coffees. Homebrewers love to tweak, and with coffee, there is a lot of tweaking that can be done! If you prefer to use a pre-blended espresso to roast, I recommend the _Liquid Amber Espresso Blend_ available from Sweet Maria’s. If you aren’t a home roaster, locate a good espresso blend from a local roaster. ### Ingredients - 4# Dark Malt Extract - 3# Light Malt Extract - 5 oz Dark Malt Extract (for priming) - 1# Crystal Malt 90L (Whole Grain, Crushed) - 1/8# Roasted Barley (Whole Grain, Crushed) - 1/8# Black Patent Malt (Whole Grain, Crushed) - 1/4# Chocolate Malt (Whole Grain, Crushed) - 2 oz Northern Brewer Hops - .5 oz Willamette Hops - 16 shots of Fresh Brewed Espresso - Irish Ale Liquid Yeast ### Procedure Add 1.5 gallons of water to the boiling kettle. Put all of the grains into a grain bag and tie it up as shown below.![add grain](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/add_grain1.Dpt96bB7_Z15ibw8.webp) Since we are using distilled water, we will adjust the water hardness by adding brewing salts. For this recipe, I have added 2 tsp. Calcium Chloride and 1 tsp. Magnesium Sulfate. This is a very important step that, if overlooked, will render your beer lifeless. The salts give body to the beer and also help to extract sugars from the grains. This partial mash should cook for 30 minutes at 160°-170°F.![add salts](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/add_salts.DqhHRu9D_1qbUaX.webp) After this partial mash has been completed, remove the grain bag carefully from the kettle and add the malt extract with just over a half-gallon of water, taking great care to keep stirring until fully dissolved. It is very important to pay attention to prevent a “boil-over” from occurring at this stage. At thirty minutes into the boil, we will make our first hop addition. We will add 1.5 oz of the Northern Brewer hops and continue boiling.![add malt](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/add_malt.H_SLyAoi_Z1VAuHa.webp)![add hops](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/add_hops.CeNhWgVT_cDz4n.webp) ### Multitasking While we are waiting for the next hop addition, we can prepare several things. First, we prepare a hop bag by placing the remaining .5 oz of Northern Brewer and the .5 oz of Willamette Hops into the bag which will make up our second hop addition. We will also sanitize the carboy. This can be done with either oxidized bleach cleaners or an iodophor solution. I prefer the iodophor as it sanitizes faster and requires no rinsing. Whichever you choose, mix the cleaner to the strength indicated on the instructions and add this to the carboy. Then, use the bottle brush to swirl the solution around and make sure all of the surfaces has been covered. You should spare no effort in sanitizing your equipment.![clean carboy](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/clean_carboy.kXf3WJTJ_1WCVGq.webp) ### Putting it all together After we have cleaned the carboy, we add the rest of the water (3 gallons) to it. At 55 minutes into the boil, we add the second hop addition to the boil which will cook for five minutes more before we remove it from the heat. Then, try to cool the hot wort down for fifteen minutes by putting the kettle in a large body of water such as a sink or bathtub and surrounding it with cold water. While this is cooling down, we will begin brewing espresso. For this recipe, we will brew 16 shots or 16 oz of espresso. Add this to the wort. I should mention the importance of brewing the espresso. Some recipes for so-called ‘espresso’ stouts call for adding cracked coffee to the boil, or even into the carboy during fermentation. These beers usually end up having a taste of over-extracted coffee. Brewing espresso properly, however, preserves the integrity of the espresso flavor even after weeks in the bottle. Please do not skimp on your espresso.![cold water](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/cold_water.B9o3FOis_ZFc8o6.webp)![add espresso ](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/add_espresso1.D1_Jj-LP_ZqB67z.webp) Next, we will funnel the wort into the carboy to mix with the cold water. After this, we will take a hydrometer reading by pouring a sample of the wort into a hydrometer jar. We will take a reading to determine the Original Gravity of the beer. Our reading shows a reading of 1.060 or a potential alcohol percent of roughly 8%.![pour wort ](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/pour_wort1.Dte74a1R_Z1KIzsD.webp)![read hydrometer](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/read_hydrometer.PeLm8I5-_UlurA.webp) The next step is to ‘pitch’ the yeast, and rock the carboy back and forth for a minute or two gently. This mixes the yeast throughout the beer and helps to oxygenate the beer which is helpful to the fermentation process.![rock carboy](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/rock_carboy.Rjp7qagJ_49Wm6.webp)![airlock](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/airlock.BS0mXRSg_26jqr.webp) ### The Waiting (Hardest Part) The next step is to put the carboy in a cool, dark place and wait while the fermentation happens. During this time, you can observe the bubbling action of your airlock as the CO2 escapes. Once this bubbling action is stopped, fermentation is generally complete. Normally, this takes between one and two weeks. At this point, it is safe to begin the second fermentation. This is done by boiling a quart of water and then adding 5oz. Dry Malt Extract or priming sugar. This should boil for at least 20 minutes so as to make sure it is sanitized. After it has cooled, it is poured into the beer. Next comes bottling. ### Bottling After we sanitize the caps and bottles, we will sanitize the racking cane, tubing, and bottling stem. The racking cane is set in the carboy as pictured below and is used to siphon the beer out of the carboy and into the bottles. The way this works is by gravity siphoning, not by the unsanitary method of sucking out the beer manually. One small note about bottles: if you use bottles that you have saved, only save the bottles that are not twist-offs. It is difficult for a homebrewer to put a good seal on these bottles with the standard bottle capper. You can also purchase bottles at your homebrew store if you are unsure what kind to buy.![boil priming](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/boil_priming.Bq9Q7x1p_a4YHA.webp)![sanitize caps](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/sanitize_caps.CK9MLevA_l89j1.webp) To start the siphon, we fill the tubing and bottling stem with clean water, taking great care not to touch it with our hands. Then, we attach the other end of the tubing to the racking cane. Getting a good seal between the tubing and the cane is important. Next, we will place a clean glass on the floor while the carboy is elevated on a table or counter. We will then take the bottling stem and push it down in the glass so as to depress the valve on the bottling stem which allows liquid to flow out of it. What happens is that as the clean water exits the tubing, it creates a siphon, which will start pulling the beer out of the carboy. As soon as the liquid in the glass becomes beer colored, pull the stem out of the glass to close the valve and stop the flow. Now we are ready to begin filling the bottles in the same manner, by pushing the bottling stem down to let the beer flow into the bottle and releasing it when it is less than full — just above the neck of the bottle.![start siphon](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/start_siphon.Dw3dmFBo_Z1ozFUI.webp)![fill bottle ](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/fill_bottle1.zophAE1D_Z223Yr8.webp) After the bottle is filled, we will place a cap on top and use our capper to crimp the cap securely on. Once this step is complete, the beer is ready to sit for a week at a minimum. The general rule of thumb is that the stronger a beer is in terms of alcohol or hop content, the longer it should mature before drinking. This gives it an opportunity to mellow a bit. It is good to taste your beer at several junctures to get a sense of its development. This particular brew will be optimal between 3 and 4 weeks after being in the bottle. Once this happens, store it in the coldest, darkest place you can find until you are ready to enjoy the brew. ### Conclusion Now that the beer is complete, the only step left is to consume it. To serve the homebrew, always decant the beer into a glass slowly, and stop pouring just as the yeast sediment starts to come out. While the yeast won’t harm you, it will affect the overall flavor of the beer. Some people like the flavor, some don’t, so it is best to experiment a bit. The Espresso Stout is the perfect marriage between fresh home roasted espresso and home-brewed ale. The next time you find yourself unable to choose between coffee or beer, have both. ### Resources [Espresso Blending Techniques](https://ineedcoffee.com/espresso-blending-techniques/) – Guidance on constructing an ideal espresso blend.

# Hottop Coffee Roaster [Roasting Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/roasting-coffee/)---by [Phil Jordan](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/phil-jordan/)![Hottop Coffee Roaster](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/hottop-coffee-roaster/Hottop450.jpg)_This article originally appeared on [Too Much Coffee](http://www.toomuchcoffee.com "A meeting place for European coffee enthusiasts"). This article and its photos are Copyright 2004 Too Much Coffee and are reproduced with permission._ This article covers the experiences of an early adopter of the Hottop roaster in its production form. What this article is, is a story about _Life with a Hottop_. What it is not is a detailed technical review of the machine or a detailed set of instructions about how to use the machine. Such can be found elsewhere (see the web _bibliography_ at the end of this article).![Hottop Coffee Roaster](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/Hottop4501.B_rKPuIO_tKdmG.webp)_Hottop Coffee Roaster_### What is it? What is it? Where have you been? The Hottop is only the most-talked-about home coffee roaster in the last couple of years – or at least it was until the I-Roast was announced recently. It’s certainly the most expensive coffee roaster available for the domestic market, and I know some smaller professional roasting outfits have considered it as an inexpensive sample roaster. The Hottop is a drum coffee roaster, designed for home use, with a manufacturer’s recommended batch size of 250g of green beans per roast. This also makes it the highest-capacity (commercially manufactured) home roaster by a small margin, as the Alpenrost is specified to take a batch size of 225g. The Hottop is electrically powered, both for heating and drum rotation – no gas here, unlike in professional sample roasters. It is also _computer-controlled_ – at the time of writing it is the only shipping home roaster with a built-in roasting profile (temperature over time). This is both good news and bad news. Mainly it’s good news as it means that the results produced are closer to those produced by professional drum roasters (note I said closer, not identical). It’s bad news if, after becoming proficient with the machine, you decide that in some cases you know better than the programming how a particular coffee ought to be roasted. All is not lost, however – more of this later. That’s what it is. What it isn’t is a production roaster. You won’t build a business roasting with a Hottop. You may well be successful using it as a sample roaster, but it isn’t built for production use. ### Why did I buy one? Simple. I decided I wanted to do home roasting and tried using a popcorn popper. Once. I read a lot about other people’s experiences with the available alternatives. From what I heard the Alpenrost seemed to be a reliability nightmare, and the Hearthwares were getting the usual mixed reviews. I then decided that if I wanted to do this thing, I might as well have something that did the best job I could expect for home roasting. This was in January 2003, when the Hottop wasn’t quite shipping yet but was in its final production form. The pre-production reviews I saw from 2002 were very encouraging and a well-known pundit hadn’t yet started publicly panning the thing (for reasons which I subsequently found rather suspicious). A guy in Yorkshire claimed on his website that he was selling them, even back then. He wasn’t, however, and simply ignored all attempts to contact him. After a while, I gave up on him and I emailed Chang Yue (the manufacturers) directly. As luck would have it, they were coming to London to a trade show in a couple of weeks’ time, and they were bringing over a sample to show to punters at the show. They’d bring another one over just for me. What the hell – I figured if I didn’t like it, there was enough interest to shift it on eBay. Probably. Price – $700 US, in cash, preferably in US currency. Ah well. On the 10th of February 2003, I pitched up at Olympia at the Asia Expo. This turned out to be a trade show, so in order to register, I had to pretend to be in an appropriate business. I was _Anise Coffee_. I walked over to the Chang Yue stand, introduced myself to the charming Shelly, and was given a long talk about the machine and the marketing challenges in N. America, a full demonstration, and lots of coffee, both roasted and green. I walked out an hour or so later with a sizeable cardboard carton containing my new baby, happy and ready to roast my own coffee forever more. Or not. We’d see. Carrying it across London back to my office in the City, and then subsequently home via the Tube and the usual High-Speed Train was entertaining. ### Description of the machine – Pt 1 The Hottop is an electrically-powered tabletop drum coffee roaster, capable of roasting 250g per batch according to the manufacturer (although some users claim to have roasted batches of 300g or so most effectively – in fact there are reasons why this might sometimes be a good idea – see later).![Detailed view of Hottop Coffee Roaster](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/Hottop_full_labelled_larger.Bl0nWYML_U42Td.webp)_Detailed view of Hottop Coffee Roaster_ The first impression when you take the machine out of the box is that it’s a fairly large piece of kit. The overall footprint is 25.5 cm by 48 cm, and it stands 36 cm tall. The drum housing is the most striking part of the machine, being finished in chrome or something similar. The base and drum mounting are constructed of a solid plastic material. At the front of the machine is a removable, perforated metal cooling tray, with a motorised stirring arm. When the roasting stage is complete the coffee is dropped into the cooling tray, where the air is blown up through the coffee to cool it by a fan mounted on the base, while the coffee is simultaneously stirred by a rotating arm mounted on the cooling tray. This is a very similar configuration to that used in many professional drum roasters. The drum housing is not insulated – during use it can get quite hot. This upset many of our North American cousins, many of whom seemed to feel that while they were far too intelligent to deliberately touch a surface that reaches a temperature of over 200° Celsius during operation, they couldn’t speak for the rest of the world. In fact, some people seemed to get upset about the roaster’s name, feeling that it was a reference to this perceived safety risk. Whatever. The machine ships with a pair of removable wire guards which clip to the outside of the drum housing and prevent you from doing anything silly in that area. The front cover of the drum housing is removable: it is attached by a knurled screw. The cover also contains a clear glass window through which you can easily see the beans while they roast. After removing the front cover, the (removable) front mounting plate for the drum axle is exposed. Access to the interior of the drum is also possible – in fact easy. It’s a good idea to clean the drum out regularly as some chaff and broken beans can become trapped inside the drum and not fall into the chaff tray. Under the drum is a chaff collection tray, which slides out for cleaning (it is not necessary to remove the front cover for this). The front drum mounting plate is easily removed by removing the four Philips screws which retain it. The drum then slides out easily and can be cleaned thoroughly. Apparently, the drum is dishwasher-safe, but I stick to cleaning mine with a soft brush and a pointed knife to remove trapped bits of bean. The interior contains a corkscrew arrangement of thick wire attached to the inside surface of the drum and three impeller plates. Between them, these serve to tumble the beans within the drum as it rotates and to move them along the length of the drum to ensure even heating. Removing the drum, the only features of note within the drum housing are the rear-drive mounting for the drum axle, the heating element (on the side of the drum opposite to the user control panel), and a small circular insert on the rear face of the drum enclosure. This is the temperature sensor, and some sources report that it should be cleaned occasionally to remove deposits of burned coffee oils. This may be so, but after over two hundred roasts I can detect no sign that mine requires cleaning. One side of the roaster is dominated by the control panel. This is extremely simple to use, but I have to agree with those who say that it is too simple. There are four buttons, marked variously _Start | Power_, _Eject_, _Plus_ and _Setting_. There is also an arc of seven red LEDs labeled from _1_ to _7_ to indicate the level of roast pre-selected. The rear of the roaster contains a fan assembly, used to draw heated air through the roasting chamber and to remove smoke. The air passes through a large removable filter assembly before being ejected from the rear of the roaster. Earlier versions of the roaster used an activated-charcoal impregnated foam filter material. This material is removable and according to the manufacturer should be replaced after approximately thirty roasts. Later versions use an additional layer of white microfibre material. This two-part filter is also supplied to all customers buying replacement filters. Beans are introduced into the roaster via a chute on the top of the drum housing. This chute has a loose-fitting lid with a cool plastic handle and is left in place during roasting. The Hottop’s roasting profile is a pre-programmed curve of temperature over time. The roaster’s control circuit utilises the roasting chamber temperature sensor and heating element in conjunction to attempt to achieve a pre-programmed temperature at a given time from the start of the roasting session. Various factors such as the moisture content and size of the beans and the ambient temperature affect how well this is achieved. ### Description of the machine – Pt 2 The front cover of the drum housing is removable: it is attached by a knurled screw.

Various factors such as the moisture content and size of the beans and the ambient temperature affect how well this is achieved. ### Roasting with the Hottop A roasting session is initiated by pressing _Start_. The LED for Setting “1” starts to flash. Repeatedly pressing the _Setting_ button selects the roasting level desired, from 1-7 (if you go too far you simply end up starting at 1 again). Pressing _Start_ for a second time then initiates the roasting process. The drum starts to rotate and the machine begins to pre-heat. You don’t add any beans at this stage! After about four or five minutes the roaster is heated to its pre-determined start temperature. The control circuitry announces this to the user via a clearly audible _beeping_ noise that continues for around a minute. Don’t worry, you won’t miss it. Pour your measured quantity of beans through the loading chute, replace the lid and wait. That’s it. Well, not quite. The roaster will happily terminate your roasting session for you as soon as it determines that the pre-programmed end-point that you selected has been reached. However, you soon realise that to get the best results, you are the best judge of when to terminate the roast. For this reason, most users simply set the roaster on setting 7 and then wait for the roasting signs (cracks, smell, less often colour) that indicate that the roast is ready and at the stage that they were seeking. At this point, they press the _Eject_ button and the roast is terminated. When the roast comes to an end, either automatically or when the user manually intervenes, a small solenoid-operated trap door at the rear of the drum is opened and the beans are dumped into the cooling tray. At the same time, a stirring arm in the perforated cooling tray starts turning, stirring the roasted bean mass. A fan is mounted under the cooling tray and this blows cool air up through the beans as they are stirred. The arrangement is most effective, and the beans are cooled to room temperature after about four minutes. The roaster then beeps at you again as it did at the beginning, signaling the end of the roasting session, and everything stops.![Hottop Cooling Tray](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/Hottop_cooling_tray_labelle.D44iNec7_ZUE8Vj.webp)_Hottop Cooling Tray_ That’s it! Job done! ### Initial Experiences Remember, I had no real previous experience roasting my own coffee. I’d had a quick play with a popcorn maker and decided that that seemed hard work to do it right – I’d nearly cremated a batch of Lintong in around four minutes! So I was well positioned to understand how a complete beginner would fare roasting with a Hottop. I was a complete beginner! The answer is: like a duck to water! The Hottop is an ideal machine to learn roasting on. It’s so easy to hear, see and smell what is going on. I immediately learned what _first crack_ and _second crack_ sounded like, and was able to start judging exactly how I liked my coffee roasted. As soon as I got a good supply of beans in stock, I was happily trying my hand at blending as well. I was very happy. I started logging all of my experiences when roasting too, in pursuit of a better understanding of my roasting results and also particularly in pursuit of repeatability. I bought a cheap stopwatch for timing. One thing I soon found was that I couldn’t always exactly repeat a previous roast. Some days, I could get to the same end-point with a particular bean within seconds of that achieved on a previous roast. On other days, I could be as much as a minute and a half off. Why? ### Voltage sensitivity I soon understood a basic fact of life with electric coffee roasters: they are pretty sensitive to line voltage conditions. When I roasted at times when large domestic appliances in my house (such as the washing machine, oven, tumble drier, dishwasher – you name it!) were working, I would find that my roasting times were extended by a minute or two. I tried measuring the line voltage being supplied to the roaster and soon came up with the following information : - The nominal supply voltage for my location is 240V +- 1V – it’s pretty stable - Switch on a current-hungry appliance such as one of those mentioned above and the voltage drops by 2-3V - Switch on a couple or more appliances (washer and tumble drier, maybe the dishwasher too – ah, domestic bliss!) and the voltage could be off by up to 5 – 6 V. - This sort of voltage variation made a big difference to the roasting duration. This difference was discernible in the taste of the roasted coffee. - Finally, to add insult to injury my Hottop is rated for the European standard voltage of 230V. Clearly, my house is not being supplied with a standard European voltage! I researched this issue of voltage on the Internet. I was able to find out that the European convergence of supply voltages was intended to cause all countries to be supplied with a pan-European standard voltage of 230V, and that that convergence should occur in 2003. I am writing this article in late 2003 / early 2004 and it doesn’t seem to have happened yet – at least not where I live anyway. These findings were a concern. On the one hand, I was finding that my Hottop (in fact, all electrically powered roasters I believe) was really quite fussy about the line voltage and those seemingly small variations could cause quite a big difference in the end results. On the other hand, my roaster was (quite sensibly you would think) rated for the European standard voltage of 230V, 10V adrift from the actual voltage I was feeding it. Clearly, I was not obtaining the roasting results that the designer intended when he programmed the roasting profile. What to do? ### Resolving the voltage sensitivity issue I went out and bought a second-hand variac. This is a Claude Lyons _Regavolt_, a very substantial piece of laboratory equipment indeed, rated at 10A. New items of this type that I looked at on the Internet cost between GBP300 and GBP400 (say very roughly between 400 and 550 EURO). I got mine for GBP40 from Telford Instruments, plus another GBP20 for next-day shipping. I then went and spoiled everything by buying a Fluke 77 meter to monitor it with (around GBP150 I recall). Using the variac I have been able to play with the supply voltage to my heart’s content. After lots of playing, I have come to the following conclusions: 1. Most coffees roast very well indeed using the Hottop’s built-in temperature/time profile provided I supply the machine with its intended 230V. Coffees roasted at 240V still taste good, but dropping the voltage to 230V using the variac undoubtedly improves matters. 2. A very small number of coffees benefit from a slightly slower, more extended roast (something to do with allowing the chemical (Maillard?) reactions that generate the flavour compounds time to progress before being stopped by more elevated temperatures, I think). If you have a coffee like this (Sweet Maria’s Kenya _Mika_ and Hasbean’s Colombian _La Manuela_ are both coffees that I have encountered that fall into this category) then drop the voltage by 15-20V as soon as the roast hits the first crack (but not before) seems to do the job quite nicely. The Hottop shows no sign of concern at being fed this lower voltage, although the roasting fan runs perceptibly more slowly. ### Good news on voltage sensitivity As a result of my experiences being shared with the new UK (and possibly European) distributor of the Hottop, I am very pleased to be able to relate that all machines sold in the U.K. from now on will be rated at 240V. Machines sold in Europe will be rated at 230V. So you’ve no need to worry about all of this if you’re planning to go out and buy a new Hottop. I’ve related it all for the sake of interest, and also to demonstrate that you do need to be a little careful what else is going on in your home when you choose to do some roasting. Also, the manufacturer claims that the current control chip logic is much less sensitive to voltage variations than the original one I was supplied with. However, I still think it’s best to play safe. ### Other notes on repeatable roasting and living with the machine One other factor that affects the roast profile is how hot the machine is when you start the roast. Second and subsequent roasts are always slower than the first roast. I have heard it said that this is something to do with the machine incorrectly performing the pre-heating cycle on roasts where the machine is already hot. I cannot comment on this (although I really ought to do some temperature measurements to test that theory). However, it remains a fact that subsequent roasts seem to be performed to a different profile to those performed in a cold roaster. That said, a professional roaster friend of mine tells me that a cold roaster always roasts differently to a pre-heated one, although I suspect that the effect he experiences on his big professional machine is the other way around to the one I just described. ### Domestic issues The principal domestic issue in my household is that my wife and daughter complain vociferously if I don’t have a fresh supply of wonderful, fresh-roasted coffee! That said, there is one minor domestic issue. Let’s face it: coffee roasting generates smoke. The darker you roast, the more smoke you get. You can’t get away from it! The Hottop roasts a large batch of coffee for a domestic roaster. The smoke filter does a wonderful job of reducing the offensiveness of the smoke. However, you are going to get smoke. If you can’t handle that then home coffee roasting is not for you. Personally, I roast in the kitchen and just make the family put up with the odd bit of smoke now and then. However, if I was worried about this I’m told an extractor fan does an excellent job of clearing what smoke there is. Alternatively, roast in the garage or the shed. It’s up to you.![Hottop Coffee Roaster Filter](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/Hottop_filter_cropped300.DqEAefvY_1Pd1LB.webp)_Hottop Coffee Roaster Filter_### Where next? I’ve had my Hottop for around 15 months now and I simply couldn’t imagine being without it. I’ve roasted all sorts of absolutely top-notch coffees and I’m generally speaking thrilled with the results. In search of repeatability, I have purchased a thermocouple and meter so that I can measure the temperature in the roasting chamber and terminate the roast based on the measured temperature. It’s good fun to play with this sort of thing, and it probably improves my roasting results in certain cases to a slight degree. It also enables me to play games by altering the profile the designer programmed into the machine. Another way of altering the profile is to use a slightly larger charge of green beans. The Hottop is allegedly quite capable of taking (at least) 300g of green beans. The only issue is that this slightly extends the roast. However, in some cases, this can be helpful, as mentioned above regarding the Kenya _Mika_ and the Colombian _La Manuela_. So you don’t need to buy a variac! The other issue you should take note of is cleanliness. Coffee roasting (especially when roasting dry-processed coffees) has chaff as a by-product. This accumulates in the drum. Most of it falls into the chaff tray and can then be removed. However, some of it collects in the drum housing. It’s fairly easy to blow this out using an air duster (obtainable at most computer or photographic shops). Also, eventually, you’ll find some pieces of bean eventually get trapped in the drum. If you don’t get rid of this stuff it will char and burn. At best this can taint the roast. At worst it could cause a fire.![Hottop Chaff Tray](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/Hottop_chaff_tray_cropped35.DOvc04Vs_Z2ueX63.webp)_Hottop Chaff Tray_ Look after your roaster and it will continue to give you excellent coffee. I intend to report on many of my other findings and experiences resulting from playing with Hottop. However, for the moment I’m just too busy roasting coffee! ### Conclusion After 15 months of living with a Hottop, I can only say that it’s an absolutely top-notch machine. Anyone who wants to roast their own coffee and doesn’t want to fuss about building a barbecue roaster (not all that practical here in Northern Europe anyway!) or some sort of mucked-about computer-controlled popcorn maker (sorry Mnemonix!) could do no better than simply to go out and buy one of these. I have had only two issues with mine during its life. Firstly, I learned about voltage sensitivity the hard way. This should not worry new purchasers as all machines imported to the UK & Europe will be correctly manufactured for local voltage conditions. Secondly, after about 10 months the stirrer motor on my cooling tray failed. Hottop replaced it immediately, without question, sending me a replacement direct from Taiwan by FedEx so that I was up and running again in about 3 days. How good is that? If you can spare the cash, go out and buy one. I’ve never bought roasted coffee at all since getting mine, and frankly, I can’t imagine doing so again (even if it was from a really good roaster like Hasbean, Hill and Valley, or James Gourmet Coffee). Outstanding! ### Resources [Hottop KN-8828P Coffee Bean Roaster First Look](https://ineedcoffee.com/hottop-kn-8828p-coffee-bean-roaster-first-look/) – 2008 article on the Hottop KN-8828P.

# Hottop KN-8828P Coffee Bean Roaster First Look [Roasting Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/roasting-coffee/)---by [Chris Arnold](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/chris-arnold/)![Hottop KN-8828P Coffee Bean Roaster First Look](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/hottop-kn-8828p-coffee-bean-roaster-first-look/filter400.jpg) The Hottop Coffee Roaster has been around for a few years now and has proven to be a reliable coffee roaster, and the support from Michael at Hottop USA has been excellent; I have firsthand experience, as well as anecdotal 3rd party accounts. They have continued to make small, incremental improvements to the original base model, providing easy do-it-yourself upgrades along the way. In fact, even the oldest original model (KN-8828) can be upgraded to the newest, most expensive Hot top roaster (KN-8828P), completely by the end-user, and in a matter of a few minutes. Maybe you currently have a KN-8828P Hottop Roaster and would like to get more out of it. Maybe you are thinking of upgrading from one of your simpler models like the KN8828, KN-8828D, or KN-8828B to the more advanced KN-8828P digital model. Maybe you are wondering if you should even buy one, especially considering the hefty price tag nearing $1000. Hopefully, I can point out not just basic usage, programs, and maintenance but some other finer details that might help you decide whether the KN8828P Hot Top Coffee Roaster is for you. ### Basic Usage The KN-8828P can be used out of the box with the “AUTO” program, which is handy if you want to get started right away. While this might work for some, the real coffee geek will want to set up their own custom programs. We will touch on that later. To get started, you can simply power it on and select the Automatic program with a couple of button presses, and the machine will begin a Warm-Up cycle, where the roaster will warm itself up to the necessary temperature of about 175 degrees Fahrenheit. This ensures that your roast always starts at the same temperature, and ensures repeatable roasts. Once ready, it will beep at you, along with a graphic on the LCD, basically asking you to dump your beans in. The recommended green coffee load is 250 grams (about 9 ounces). I have found this to be a good number, and by not straying up or down from it, I have had good results. After dumping the beans into the unit through the top chamber, you will hear the beans being agitated vigorously. Over the next 15 minutes or so, you will see various indicators on the LCD indicating fan speed, temperature, which segment the roaster is on, and how far into each segment. The latter is accomplished using 4 little indicators for each segment: 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100% (completed). It should be noted that there is something called “Advanced Manual Control”. It allows the user to adjust roasting parameters on the fly. I have found no need or desire to use this, but if you are interested, the PDF manual can tell you all about it. Now fast forward about 15 minutes or so. You will begin to hear the first crack. After the first crack, there should be a pause before the start of the second crack. Most users will stop the roast for a few seconds or snaps into the second crack.![Hottop Color LCD Control Panel and Button](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/panel5001.ChLa5Qzm_dSR3B.webp)_Hottop Color LCD Control Panel and Button_ If you were to let the roast go completely on its own, you would notice that in the last 30 seconds of the roast, the machine will beep, and flash “Plus Time”, which allows you to add time to the roast in 30-second increments (up to 6 times). If you do nothing, the beans will dump into the tray and begin cooling. Otherwise, you can add time to the end of the roast with a maximum of 24 minutes total (21 minutes max AUTO program starting time, plus 6 additional presses which are 30 seconds each). Note that although the AUTO program only allows for a max of 21 to start within its pre-defined program, with a custom profile you can start with a max of 22 minutes, and thus the max overall time is 25 minutes for custom. Confused? Don’t be. I wouldn’t worry about the max times too much, as you typically would want to keep your roast times under 20 minutes anyway. Another little safety feature you may notice as the roast gets near the end is the high temp warning. If the temperature reaches 414 degrees Fahrenheit, the unit will beep, prompting you to hit enter to allow the roast to continue. This is just to ensure that a fire does not break out. If you do nothing, the beans will dump into the tray and begin cooling. Before you start the next roast, the machine will beep to prompt you to empty the chaff tray, along with a graphic on the LCD. This ensures the user will not leave too much chaff in the tray, increasing the chance of a fire. ### Custom Programs (Profiles) The Hottop KN-8828P can hold 10 Profiles (called “Programs”). One is already pre-set, and cannot be deleted, so that leaves 9 for the user. Each Program can have eight segments. Each segment can be up to 3 minutes long (with a minimum of 10 minutes and a maximum of 22 minutes). Within each segment, you can specify the time, a target temperature (within a specific range of course), and the fan speed. The fan is mainly used to evacuate smoke from the beans to minimize the beans’ taking on a smokey flavor. See my base profile for a better understanding of what a program consists of. Entering a program is a little involved, but once you get your first program in, the rest becomes easier. This is because programs can be copied from one program to another program slot with a couple of button presses. I suggest mapping out a base program on paper (or using my base program) before you sit in front of the roaster. This will make it easier to enter. Trust me on this one. ### Flavor One of the things a lot of home roasters try to do is stretch the time between 1st crack and 2nd crack (2 minutes is a nice round number), with a total roasting time of about 14-19 minutes. Well, I am here to tell you that this roaster can meet these conditions fairly easily. I cannot say the same thing about many of the home electric coffee roasters I have had over the past few years. Some are one or the other extreme, and sometimes too extreme (sour or baked). I found that with the Hottop, I could achieve fairly bright, shorter roasts for my drip, vac pot, and French Press coffee needs, but also get sweeter, mellower, longer roasts for my espresso needs. While I really like the Fluid Air Bed method of roasting (found in roasters like the Sonofresco), the Hottop provides a slightly different flavor across the board. It is capable of slightly less bright roasts, but still provides a roast adequate for drip, vac pot, French Press, etc. On the espresso end of things, it really does an excellent job. Of all the roasters I have owned or used, this one consistently provides, for my taste, some of the best espresso shots ever pulled in my house. What I am saying, is that for me, I don’t currently feel the need for more than the Hot Top Roaster. ### Cleaning and Maintenance After every roast, I find it necessary to use compressed air to blow the large amounts of chaff out of the roasting chamber, chaff tray slot, and all connecting airways. This is probably the biggest annoyance of all, so factor in another $100 for a decent compressor to keep around. The viewing window can easily become obscured with coffee oils. The cleaning is simple. Loosen the big brass screw, and remove the cover that includes the glass window. A little solution of Cafiza in hot water and a rag, a quick rinse, and the job is complete. I find I have to do this every 2 to 3 roasts, which I find a little annoying, but I’m not sure if there is anything that could have been done differently in the design.![glass viewing window](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/window500.CxTdq_w3_FJdKQ.webp)_The glass viewing window is excellent for watching the development of the roast. It gets dirty easily but is also easily cleaned._ The drum itself is recommended to be removed every 5-10 roasts and cleaned with Cafiza solution, as well as any other debris like bits of coffee beans, chaff, etc. The chaff tray can get some muck on it, but it too can be cleaned with a Cafiza solution and a rag, but probably every 50 roasts would be adequate. Interior cleaning is recommended every 3 months. The steps are fairly involved, so please see the manual for full details. Mainly, it involves cleaning the circuit board and rear fan areas of dust and debris. The Rear filter is recommended to be changed every 20 roasts. Many have found that soaking the entire filter (including the plastic holder and filter materials) in a cleaning solution like Cafiza, can extend the life of the filter. If you try to remove the paper filter component, it can be very difficult to get it back in, so that is why I recommend keeping it all together when cleaning. Please note the manufacturer does not recommend this, so please do so at your own risk. The top filter is recommended to be changed every 100 roasts. Not sure how critical this is, but it probably wouldn’t hurt to follow this recommendation, since every 100 roasts for most people works out to about once or twice a year.![main rear filter](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/filter400.fkQlQaz3_Z20eRJI.webp)_The main rear filter can get blocked quickly, and replacement is recommended every 20 roasts._ The rest of the machine can be wiped with a soft cotton cloth and water if necessary. ### Tips and Comments For those who have an adequate household voltage of 120VAC or above, the following may not make a difference. Nonetheless, I recommend the use of a high amperage Variac (to always provide the same, adequate voltage on every roasting session), and a Kill-a-Watt, which we will just use as a fancy digital voltage meter, that allows us to accurately read and set voltage with the Variac on the fly. 20 AMP Variacs can be purchased brand new for a little over $100 on the net.![Variac and Kill-a-Watt](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/variac500.eAR3oBrs_1j1MeS.webp)_Variac and Kill-a-Watt provide adequate and consistent voltage, which results in repeatable roasts._ For all operations, each button is backlit, and only buttons that are applicable at that time will light up. Very nice touch. The LCD itself will be backlit with different colors depending on what the roaster is doing. Again, good use of technology, actually telling us something useful. The cooling happens outside the roasting chamber, which means that when you decide to stop the roast, the beans do not continue to roast very much. The cooling cycle on the Hottop is 4 minutes, but the beans are usually cool within about 2 minutes. Many other roasters on the market have cool-down cycles that take upwards of 10 minutes, which means you have a lot more guessing to do, so as to “coast” into the desired roast level. Or you have to bypass the manufacturer’s design, by pulling the beans and cooling them externally, thus risking damaging internal components. I like the Hottop way much better, and other manufacturers should take note of this very crucial weakness in many other home coffee roasters. ### Conclusion Why do I prefer the KN-8828P Hottop bean roaster over other Hottop models? Simply put, I am a coffee geek. I love being able to have a big color-coded LCD readout. I love being able to program and save 9 programs and have 8 segments for each program, and tweak it down to the last detail. But more than anything, I can confidently share programs with other KN-8828P users. Every part of the equation can be quantified – Ambient Temperature, Household Voltage (when using a Variac), Green Bean Load Size, and most important: the EXACT program that another KN-8828P user can punch into their own unit. I don’t think you can easily do this with other Hottop roaster models, simply because they lack the specific programming capabilities that this unit has. At nearly $1000, the Hottop KN-8828P will not be in everyone’s budget. I think its reliability is what appealed to me first and foremost. Add the advanced programmability, and a cooling mechanism outside the roasting chamber, and I was sold into trying it. Of course, it is about how the coffee tastes, so after developing a profile that seemed to work on just about every green bean in my stash, I determined this guy a keeper. Check out the pros and cons listed below, which may help you further in your decision. ### Pros and Cons PROS - Digital Programmability - Can confidently share programs with other KN-8828P owners - Proven track record (excellent reliability & factory service) - Quiet Operation (easy to hear 1st and 2nd crack) - Excellent bean agitation, resulting in a very even roast - Cooling happens outside of the drum (very important to get the desired roast level) - Viewing window for easy view of beans - The warmup cycle ensures repeatable consistent coffee roasting - The cooldown cycle ensures that back to back roasts will not prematurely wear out the machine - Capable of both bright and sweet roasts (drip and espresso from a single roaster) CONS - Viewing window easily gets dirty, requiring frequent cleaning - Leaks smoke in several places - Chaff collection is poor - Somewhat confusing control panel - Some Poor choices on what the LCD readout displays - Somewhat expensive filter (though you can clean it yourself) - The drum can be noisy, even after the “brass screw adjustment” - Roast capacity is a little small at 9 ounces (250 grams) ### Base Profile Voltage when heating element on – 120VAC (124VAC at idle) Ambient Temperature – 65-75 degrees Fahrenheit Green Coffee Load Size – 9 ounces (250 grams) Total Roast Time – 18 Minutes (sometimes cut short or extended, but usually not by much) Segment 1 – FAN 0 – TEMP 235 – TIME 2:00 Segment 2 – FAN 0 – TEMP 295 – TIME 2:00 Segment 3 – FAN 1 – TEMP 320 – TIME 1:00 Segment 4 – FAN 1 – TEMP 340 – TIME 1:00 Segment 5 – FAN 2 – TEMP 360 – TIME 3:00 Segment 6 – FAN 2 – TEMP 380 – TIME 3:00 Segment 7 – FAN 3 – TEMP 400 – TIME 3:00 Segment 8 – FAN 3 – TEMP 420 – TIME 3:00 [Hottop Coffee Roaster](https://ineedcoffee.com/hottop-coffee-roaster/) – INeedCoffee article by Phil Jordan Published on March 1, 2008--- #### Chris Arnold Chris is the creator of Two Bit History.

# How Dark is Your Arabic Coffee? [Brewing Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/brewing-coffee/)---by [Holland Morgan](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/holland-morgan/)![How Dark is Your Arabic Coffee?](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/how-dark-is-your-arabic-coffee/turkish-steep.jpg) With a great sense of self-satisfaction, I poured the steaming, dark, roasted brew, smelling just faintly of cardamom, into the tiny cup in front of my father-in-law. Naturally, I, as a chef, wanted to impress him with my vast knowledge of food and satisfy his senses with a taste of his native country. He put his nose over the demitasse and inhaled the gently rising vapor. “Mmmm,” he said, wafting the steam toward his face, “Turkish coffee.” I didn’t get his reference at first. “You know, in Jordan,” he began again, “they roast the beans just slightly, and the coffee is very light. Sometimes I don’t even roast my beans at all.”![turkish coffee setup gear](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/turkish-coffee-setup-gear1.BXJF9vdQ_Z2w3pcn.webp) I never got that memo. It seemed, at first, like nobody had ever heard of this hardly roasted coffee. In every book I’ve read concerning coffee, Turkish coffee and Arabic coffee are synonymous. I did finally find sources corroborating these outrageous claims. After a little trial and error, I produced a cup acceptable to my father-in-law and sure to please or at least intrigue even the non-coffee drinker. Having an almost tea-like flavor, this coffee is fun to make and impressive to even the most epicurean dinner guests. A terrific article on roasting your own coffee beans in a popcorn popper is [Roasting Coffee in a Popcorn Popper](https://ineedcoffee.com/roasting-coffee-in-a-popcorn-popper/). Don’t be intimidated by roasting your own coffee—it’s easier than it looks. This coffee is all about the depth of the roast, so roast your beans only until they are the color of peanut butter. A few here and there may be a little darker it’s O.K. Once your coffee is roasted and has rested the appropriate amount of time it will be time to grind. I have an Arabic coffee grinder (pictured in this article). I grind black pepper with it. Great for pepper, not so great for coffee. Once I thought I would grind coffee in it just to be authentic. I got so impatient at its unbearably slow pace that I removed the crank and attached my cordless drill to the center shaft and let ‘er rip. Still slow! Use an electric coffee grinder and grind it into powder, if you want throw a few cardamom pods in during grinding.![cardamon](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/cardamon.Cv83OdKS_253qgb.webp) In Arabic coffee pot boil the water. A little sugar may be added to the water before boiling if desired. Start with a teaspoon per every 6 ounces.![add sugar](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/add-sugar.B9oLoeGR_ZATu0H.webp) Once the water boils, turn the heat off and add 1 Tablespoon of ground coffee per cup of water.![turkish steep](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/turkish-steep.CxGZ79Gi_ITW2O.webp) Let it steep for about 45 seconds and stir once to help the grounds settle.

# Housing and the Coffee Shop Economic Indicator [Coffee Business](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/coffee-business/)---by [Marketman](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/marketman/)![Housing and the Coffee Shop Economic Indicator](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/housing-and-the-coffee-shop-economic-indicator/stumptown-pine1.jpg) Back in January of this year, Herb Greenberg made headlines by discovering a new leading economic indicator at his favorite Chinese restaurant. He called it the _Hot-and-Sour soup indicator_, apparently named after his favorite menu item. Herb is a regular at the Chinese restaurants near his San Diego home, and the local staff was not shy about reporting the dramatic economic slowdown in Hong Kong and China well before the Asian slowdown was reported by the official media. The hot and sour soup is a leading economic indicator direct from the U.S.-based relatives of the Hong Kong and Chinese citizens feeling the pain of their regions slowdown. Herb went on to compare the hot and sour soup indicator to the official rear view mirror indicators released by the government, calling the former at least as credible. In honor of Herb’s findings, I will now release my findings on the coffee shop housing bubble indicator. Back in 2006, at the height of the housing bubble, it was impossible to walk into a coffee shop in the high flying bubble areas – California or Seattle – and NOT hear people raving about how much money they were making on their houses. Those conversations occurred in 2005 and 2007, of course, but the peak of the coffee shop real estate wealth conversations occurred in 2006, by my very scientific calculations. And that peak corresponded precisely to the peak of the national housing bubble.![stumptown pine](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/stumptown-pine1.COE3oqB7_1gJaTo.webp)_Stumptown Coffee – Pine Street, Seattle_ Today if I walk into any coffee shop in Seattle and listen (eavesdrop) attentively, I hear mixed signals from the coffee shop indicator. While some conversations point to worry over the value of houses, others are convinced their house is still appreciating. In terms of economic forecasting, I would say we are still well above the bottom of the housing bubble, despite the National Association of Realtors’ claims to the contrary. The coffee shop housing indicator does not lie, and we will not truly be at the bottom until the peak of the coffee shop conversations relate to housing wealth deterioration across the country. I’ll be sure to let everyone know the precise moment in time when that happens, and it’s safe to buy your new dream home. Don’t hold your breath waiting as the housing pain has just started in some parts of the country (Seattle) and will likely last several years to come. ### Resources [Hot-and-Sour Soup Indicator](https://web.archive.org/web/20090829111343/http://blogs.marketwatch.com:80/greenberg/2008/01/hot-and-sour-soup-indicator/) – Article by financial reporter Herb Greenberg.

# How Coffee Can Help You Attain Fitness and Weight Loss [Coffee and Health](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/coffee-health/)---by [Jose Antonio PhD](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/jose-antonio-phd/)![How Coffee Can Help You Attain Fitness and Weight Loss](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/how-coffee-can-help-you-attain-fitness-and-weight-loss/espresso-on-white-saucer1.jpg) What’s the first thing over 100 million Americans do when they wake up? If you’re one of the many java-addicted consumers, you probably make a beeline for the coffee brewer and with your eyes half-open, brew up a fresh cup of the aromatic brown elixir. Now despite the rumors that have circulated from Boston to Beijing, coffee is actually a healthy beverage that is consumed by billions around the world. Certainly, if you take a common-sense approach to whether coffee is safe (or not), it would be perverse to withhold the provisional assent that it is indeed safe considering that billions of individuals drink it every day. Furthermore, the key ingredient in coffee, caffeine is actually an amazing substance that has a wide variety of functions. For instance, caffeine improves performance and endurance during prolonged, exhaustive exercise. But it also promotes gains in short-term, high-intensity athletic performance. Caffeine decreases your perception of pain during exercise. This might explain why fitness competitors routinely down a cup of java right before exercise. Caffeine also improves mental alertness and reduces your perception of fatigue. Moreover, habitual intake does decrease caffeine’s ergogenic properties. ### Coffee – the amazing elixir And you might be surprised to hear that coffee itself may be a health food. For instance, we know that regular consumption of coffee decreases the risk of type II diabetes. A recent study examined the long-term relationship between coffee consumption and other caffeinated beverages and incidence of type 2 diabetes mellitus: The Nurses’ Health Study and Health Professionals Follow-up Study.![espresso](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/espresso-on-white-saucer1.BSETCcfF_Z1hSns7.webp) Scientists tracked 41,934 men from 1986 to 1998 and 84,276 women from 1980 to 1998. These were free of diabetes, cancer, or cardiovascular disease at baseline. Coffee consumption was assessed every 2 to 4 years through validated questionnaires. What did they find? These investigators documented 1333 new cases of type 2 diabetes in men and 4085 new cases in women. The authors found an inverse association between coffee intake and type 2 diabetes after adjustment for age, body mass index, and other risk factors. In other words, those who drank the most coffee tended to have the least risk of diabetes. Even more intriguing, total caffeine intake from coffee and other sources was associated with a statistically significantly lower risk for diabetes in both men and women; meaning that decaffeinated coffee may not be as good for you as the caffeine-filled. The author’s concluded that the “data suggest that long-term coffee consumption is associated with a statistically significantly lower risk for type 2 diabetes.”(1) The Amazing Trio – Energy, Performance Enhancement, and Fat Burning ### Energy Perhaps the most common reason for ingesting caffeine or caffeine-containing beverages is the pick-me-up effect. For instance, one study examined one hundred and forty-four volunteers (72 male, 72 female, mean age 21 years) and had them consume breakfast (cereal versus no breakfast) and caffeine (caffeinated versus decaffeinated coffee). They found that those who consumed breakfast cereal had a more positive mood at the start of the test sessions, performed better on a spatial memory task, and felt calmer at the end of the test session than those in the no breakfast condition (lesson: don’t skip breakfast:)). Consuming caffeine improved the “encoding of new information and counteracted the fatigue that developed over the test session.”(2) ### Performance Enhancer Caffeine is the most versatile and effective ergogenic aid (i.e. something that enhances exercise performance). A prominent exercise physiologist, David Costill, Ph.D., performed the ground-breaking study on caffeine and exercise 26 years ago! He took nine competitive cyclists (two females and seven males) and had them bike until exhaustion at 80% of V02 max. (Note: V02 max, also known as maximal oxygen uptake, is a measure of how well your cardiopulmonary system functions). Each subject consumed coffee containing 330 mg of caffeine 60 min before the exercise or a placebo (decaffeinated coffee). Following the ingestion of caffeine, the subjects were able to perform an average of 90 minutes of cycling as compared to an average of 76 minutes in the placebo trial. This reflects an 18% increase! They also found that subjects burned more fat (aka lipolysis) as shown by measurements of plasma-free fatty acids, glycerol, and respiratory exchange ratios. In fact, fat oxidation or burning was significantly higher (107% greater) during the caffeine trial (118 g or 1.31 g/min) than in the placebo trial (57 g or 0.75 g/min). Also, the perception of effort was much less in subjects after consuming subjects indicating that exercise felt easier.(3) Other research has confirmed the performance-enhancing effects of caffeine.(4-7) ### Thermogenesis A recent study looked at energy expenditure, fat oxidation or burning, and norepinephrine (NE) kinetics (i.e. how ‘adrenaline-like hormones are metabolized) after caffeine or placebo ingestion using placebo-controlled double-blind conditions. The dose administered was 5 mg of caffeine per kilogram of fat-free mass (which is mainly muscle and bone). Translation: For the young men, they consumed about 350 mg while the old men consumed about 295 mg. (Therefore, the young men had more FFM than the old men). They studied 10 older (65-80 yr) and 10 younger (19-26 yr) men who were moderate consumers of caffeine. Caffeine ingestion resulted in similar increases in both the old and young men for plasma caffeine levels; thus both young and old absorb caffeine equally well. Metabolic rate or energy expenditure increased similarly by 11% in young and 9.5% in the older men. According to the scientists, “older and younger men show a similar thermogenic response to caffeine ingestion, whereas older men show a smaller increase in fatty acid availability after a caffeine challenge. These metabolic differences are not related to alterations in norepinephrine kinetics or fat oxidation.” (8) A recent study presented at the International Society of Sports Nutrition Conference in Las Vegas showed that a functional coffee beverage that also contained bitter orange, hydroxycitric acid, and chromium produced a significant increase (up to 30%) in metabolic rate. (9) This particular study is the first presented on ‘functional coffee’ (i.e. coffee with added nutraceuticals). ### The Judgement on Java Clearly, consuming coffee or caffeine can have a myriad of health benefits ranging from the increased mental and physical performance, enhanced lipolysis or fat burning, to an improvement in health (e.g. decreased risk of type 2 diabetes). With the advent of functional coffee (i.e. nutraceuticals added to coffee to enhance its health benefits), the future of java is indeed bright. Table 1.

However, there is some evidence that consumption of three or more cups of coffee per day may have a modest effect on lowering infant birth weight. Studies of coffee consumption and increased rates of spontaneous abortion and delayed time to conception are inconsistent and conclusions cannot yet be drawn.12 ### Sidebar References 1.

# How to Brew Fine Drip Over Coffee With a Stainless Steel Filter [Brewing Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/brewing-coffee/)---by [Allen J Pais](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/allen-j-pais/)![How to Brew Fine Drip Over Coffee With a Stainless Steel Filter](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/how-to-brew-fine-drip-coffee-over-with-a-stainless-steel-filter/filter-coffee.jpg) Having been raised in the South of India, it was always a privilege to have a cup of coffee in neighboring houses or in the market coffee shops. Every occasion at a gathering started with a cup of “Filter Coffee”. The Filter Coffee brewing method has changed over time with various devices, but it has been constant with the stainless-steel “Filter Coffee” device for four decades in my eyes. The fine drip Filter Coffee is a specialty of South India and is still practiced today. It can be brewed mild or strong depending on the amount of ground coffee used. One tablespoon can make 1 cup of coffee with 100 ml of hot water, however, you can always add an additional tablespoon to make the coffee stronger. Let’s make some filter coffee. ### #1 Set up the Stainless Steel Coffee Filter device Prepare the “Filter Coffee“ Stainless Steel device. It will consist of four parts. - lower settling tumbler - perforated upper brewing tumbler - perforated upper plunger - a lid![filter coffee setup](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/fine-drip-coffee-1.Dapt7fVg_Z2g7VRe.webp)_Filter Coffee setup_ Attach the perforated upper brewing tumbler on top of the lower settling tumbler, by sliding the upper with the lower. The coffee brewer is a push-fit attachment.![filter setup 2](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/fine-drip-coffee-2.CWV4OQjZ_15NKUC.webp)_Attach the two chambers._### #2 Add Ground Coffee Add the ground coffee to the top perforated brewing tumbler. Use one tablespoon of medium ground coffee to make 100 ml of coffee. The settling tumbler has a capacity of 250 ml. You can make an additional cup by adding one more tablespoon of coffee grinds with an addition of 100 ml of hot water. ### #3 Add Hot Water Add 100 ml of hot water from a boil into the upper perforated tumbler. If you are making 2 cups, add twice as much hot water.![add hot water](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/fine-drip-coffee-5.B6L8rUol_Z17fbyY.webp)_Add hot water to the coffee brewer._### #4 Place the Plunger into the Brewer Place the perforated upper plunger into the coffee brewer. It will sink into the hot water, pushing the coffee grounds down. Then cover the brewer with the lid.![Plunger](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/fine-drip-coffee-4.CFNcUe7P_1PRyjQ.webp)_Place the plunger into the brewer._![plunger going down](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/fine-drip-coffee-6.CYAwYJ0l_Zj8pr1.webp)_The plunger will sink into the water until it rests on the coffee grounds._![place lid](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/fine-drip-coffee-7.BzaCyigH_Z2rPQhc.webp)_Place the lid on the brewer._### #5 Brew For 10-15 Minutes Close the lid and wait 10-15 minutes. ### #6 Remove Top Chamber From the Lower Steel Tumbler The upper and lower tumbler can be now detached gently as they are hot, using a kitchen towel or cloth. The lower settling tumbler will be hotter than the upper brewing tumbler after brewing. It is important to take care of it while detaching.**![detach filter chamber](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/filter-coffee-detach.BAJxs2Yv_Z1e82Ic.webp)**_When the coffee settles into the lower steel tumbler, it is known as a coffee decoction._### #7 Serve It is now time to relish a finely brewed Drip over “Filter Coffee”. This coffee may be strong and require the addition of water with milk depending on one’s taste.![pour filter coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/filter-coffee-pour.B93gdjoq_Z6WUS0.webp)_Serve and enjoy!_### Video Tutorial [How to Brew a Fine Drip Over Filter Coffee](https://youtu.be/pSuMGAFoZ0c) (YouTube 6 minutes) ### Resources [How To Make Coffee Using A Thermos Flask](https://ineedcoffee.com/how-to-make-coffee-using-a-thermos-flask/) – Coffee brewing tutorial.

In 2008, Elvis researcher Adam Victor came out with The Elvis Encyclopedia. It could very well be the definitive Elvis research book. So, how did Elvis take his coffee? According to the book (p 172 Food): > At breakfast time he drank orange juice and coffee (served with half & half and as a concession to his diet, Sweet ‘n’ Low). Speaking of sweeteners, here is another interesting tidbit from the Food section: > In _Double Trouble_, Elvis’ character claims to take 418 lumps of sugar in his tea!![Elvis Coffee Mug](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/elvis-mug-temp-change.BytbAT8S_SNN4r.webp) *Timeless Elvis Presley Heat Changing Coffee Mug – Add Hot Liquid and Watch Elvis go from Vegas to Memphis * The section on Drugs (p121) tells us that by the mid-1970s, Elvis was stacking his coffee with other things. > According to Dr. Nichopoulus, Elvis’ daily regiment was coffee, vitamins and an appetite suppressant (sometimes amphetamine-based) to start the day; he’d also take a decongestant and blood pressure medicine soon after waking up.

# How Caffeine Affects Kids: Global Coffee Culture Influences [Coffee and Health](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/coffee-health/)---by [Bethany Ramos](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/bethany-ramos/)![How Caffeine Affects Kids: Global Coffee Culture Influences](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/how-caffeine-affects-kids-global-coffee-culture-influences/Kids-and-Caffeine.jpg) For most parents, the thought of giving their young child a cup of coffee ranks right up there with some of the worst parenting sins, like giving a child an alcoholic drink. However, many parents fail to consider that kids consume caffeine daily from several other sources, including soft drinks, chocolate, and even energy drinks. ### Caffeine Recommendations for Kids One main issue is the lack of [caffeine intake guidelines for kids](https://kidshealth.org/en/parents/child-caffeine.html) in the US. As a result, the amount of caffeine a young child should consume is murky at best. However, in a country like Canada, kids are restricted to a recommended 45 mg of caffeine daily at preschool age. This is equivalent to a 12-ounce soda or four small chocolate bars. If you’ve ever seen your child down cup after cup of soda at a birthday party or gorge themselves on chocolate on Halloween, they’ve probably exceeded their recommended caffeine limit. ### Caffeine Overload: Where It All Begins When a child’s diet isn’t monitored, and they end up eating too much candy and ingesting caffeine as a result, caffeine will work as a drug and place a burden on a young child’s system. Yes, that’s right – caffeine stimulates the central nervous system and may cause several related symptoms like: - Jitteriness - Headaches - Difficulty concentrating - Upset stomach - Increased heart rate - Increased blood pressure Although a moderate amount of caffeine in children shouldn’t cause an issue, kids who overdo it could experience a number of adverse health effects, including the possibility for caffeine to aggravate an existing heart problem or nervous disorder. This may be true even in children who may not be aware of a health issue.![Michael drinking Coke](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/michael_drinking_coke1.BMR7ldMw_2gftF4.webp)_A future [coffee enthusiast](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/michael-allen-smith/) enjoying Coke._### Global Coffee Cultures and Children Although American parents may feel pious by refusing to give their kids coffee at a young age, other cultures don’t share the same sentiment. Latin American cultures, especially, are well-known for giving kids coffee with milk at an early age as a warm drink served with breakfast. How early do kids in Latin America drink coffee? It depends, although many locals reveal it can be as early as a child is out of a high chair. Many Latin American coffee drinkers liken this to the French view on wine. In France, kids are given wine in moderation at a young age, and they also drink café au lait each morning. [Nursery-age children in Brazil](https://becomebrazilian.blogspot.com/2011/03/you-know-you-have-brazilian-kids-when.html) are offered both milky coffee and caffeinated iced tea on a daily basis. Most kids love milky coffee drinks and consume them regularly during their growing years. The Brazilian government stands behind early coffee drinking and even encourages the practice. At a recent SCAA Symposium, a Brazilian coffee industry representative advocated the fact that children in elementary school are given regular coffee breaks to develop a coffee drinking habit at an early age. ### Caffeine Myths: Where to Draw the Line Although Americans may never embrace the global perspective of giving young children coffee each morning before school – or even serving coffee in an elementary school cafeteria, it’s important for parents to understand the truth about caffeine, beyond the myth. Years ago, most parents believed the age-old adage that caffeine would stunt growth. However, after years of research, scientists have been unable to prove that the theory is true. For most parents, limiting caffeine consumption is key, although it doesn’t have to be avoided altogether. While kids in the US may drink caffeinated sodas and eat chocolate, kids in other countries, like Brazil, may intake the same amount of caffeine in a daily diluted coffee drink. Interestingly enough, kids in the US who consume caffeine from soda and candy are probably at a greater risk for a number of related health issues because of excess sugar intake, including childhood obesity and diabetes. A cup of coffee in the morning for your child may not be so bad after all… Published on May 29, 2021--- #### Bethany Ramos Bethany Ramos co-owns The Coffee Bump with her husband - providing an unlimited selection of all things coffee.

# How to Brew Coffee With Fresh Chicory Root [Brewing Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/brewing-coffee/)---by [Allen J Pais](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/allen-j-pais/)![How to Brew Coffee With Fresh Chicory Root](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/how-to-brew-coffee-with-fresh-chicory-root/Coffee-with-Fresh-Chicory-Root.jpg) Each morning always starts with a hot cup of coffee. Recently, I was reminded of family memories from the 1980s of chicory in coffee. I was curious about the role of chicory in coffee, so after doing some research within our family, I learned we drank a blend of 70% Arabica and 30% roasted chicory. Today, 40 years later, I decided to recreate the taste of my family’s coffee and chicory blend. This time I wanted to start from scratch using freshly grown chicory from our own backyard. Roasted Chicory coffee tastes similar to coffee but has a flavor that’s commonly described as slightly nutty or woody, depending on the plant variety, there can be a predominant bitter taste. When roasted Arabica coffee is mixed with Chicory in a cup taste proportion of 70:30 it tastes as close as possible to the smell of roasted coffee. ### What is Chicory? The Plant Variety I used is “Spadona Chicory”, which is botanically classified as “Cichorium intybus”. The leaves are used raw in salads or cooked as a vegetable. The root can be roasted and used as a coffee substitute in a blend. Both have a bitter taste. It takes around 2-1/2 months for the root to be fully formed and requires adequate water twice a week.![chicory fresh](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/Chicory-1.BX4j1tcI_L1OGL.webp)![chicory plant](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/chicory-plant.XV2l5qdi_1nuLcU.webp) ### #1 Remove the Roots and Wash the Plant After 2-1/2 months, uproot the plant and remove the roots, carefully wash the roots until the surface of the root is smooth. Then dry the roots in the sun for a day to remove the moisture contents. One plant will give around 100 grams of roasted chicory, sufficient for 7 cups of coffee, each cup will require approximately 10 to 15 grams of roasted chicory powder.![chicory trimmed](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/Chicory-2.CnOns-Eo_Z1uIUhR.webp)![prep chicory](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/Chicory-3.D_PdPuZ__ZTTkT2.webp) ### #2 Slice the Chicory Root and Sun-Dry The next day cut the dried roots into thick 5mm slices and sun-dry them a full day to get rid of any remaining moisture.![sliced chicory](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/Chicory-4.CBYxSH7-_ZpfhYx.webp) ### #3 Roast the Chicory Place the sliced and dried chicory root on a baking tray with a sheet of baking paper. Roast the dried roots in a preheated oven at 220°F for 30 minutes. Watch the roots closely, as they may burn due to their quality or moisture content. After 30 minutes, turn down the temperature to 180°F and roast for another 10 to 15 minutes. The root slices will have a dark brown color. There may be a few slices underdone but not a worry. Remove the roasted chicory slices and let them cool down.![Chicory prepped](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/Chicory-5.CoENxwJc_2g8Y7a.webp)![roasted chicory](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/Chicory-6.B1QJnPnp_11O0He.webp)![chicory ready](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/Chicory-7.BZL6SkHm_Z15qIMv.webp) ### #4 Grind the Chicory Use a Coffee grinder or a Mortar & Pestle to grind the roasted chicory root to a fine medium coarse powder.![mortar pestle for coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/Chicory-8.b8dQGW1t_1xt7mh.webp) ### #5 Grind the Coffee Grind the medium-roasted Arabica coffee beans to a coarse grind and add a bit more to a fine powder.![coffee grind size](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/Chicory-9.LoZcmfr-_2yrB4.webp) ### #6 Blend the Chicory with the Coffee Use a stainless steel filter coffee drip-over method or a pour-over filter method to brew the coffee. Use 70% coffee and 30% roasted chicory for your blend.![prep for brew](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/Chicory-10.BxChm_P9_Ad3yi.webp) ### #7 Serve and Enjoy Pour the filtered hot Arabica Coffee blended with Chicory into a cup. Add milk and sugar as required. The lovely blend of roasted Arabica coffee with Roasted Chicory is ready for you to enjoy.![brewed chicory coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/Chicory-11.D31vCPAi_ZLxOBL.webp) ### Article Video View the video tutorial on YouTube: [How To Roast Chicory Root & Brew Coffee](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xw27EkaI4FQ).

# How to Make Chocolate Covered Coffee Beans [Recipes](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/coffee-recipes/)---by [Ivana Petricevic](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/ivana-petricevic/)![How to Make Chocolate Covered Coffee Beans](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/how-to-make-chocolate-covered-coffee-beans/how-to-make-chocolate-covered-coffee-beans.jpg) Homemade chocolate-covered coffee beans are a great treat to share with friends at a simple dinner or a special occasion. This recipe will really impress your guests because it uses three different types of chocolate: dark chocolate, milk chocolate, and white chocolate. These mini snacks have a wonderful combination of flavors, sweet on the outside and bitter on the inside. As a bonus, we are going to add a little spicy chili powder to give a boost to the dark chocolate as well as pair grated coconut for a more exotic taste. The possibilities with chocolate-covered coffee beans are endless, so give free rein to your imagination and invent your unique combinations. ### Chocolate Covered Coffee Beans Recipe Cooking time: 4 hours (+ 1 night in the fridge before consumption) #### Ingredients: - 110 gr (4 oz) dark chocolate - 110 gr (4 oz) milk chocolate - 110 gr (4 oz) white chocolate - 85 gr (3 ½ oz) coffee beans - 15 gr (3/4 oz) grated coconut - 1 tsp chili powder #### Step by Step Preparation:**#1** Separately melt the three chocolate bars in a bain-marie or double boiler (using a saucepan placed above another pan filled with boiling water).![Melt chocolate for covered espresso beans.](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/melt-3-chocolates.DATtMK3U_Z6XKH0.webp)**#2** Add chili powder to melted dark chocolate.**#3** Add 2/3 grated coconut to melted milk chocolate.**#4** Divide your coffee beans into three groups (one for each kind of frosting) and immerse them in hot melted chocolate.![3 types of chocolate covered coffee beans](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/3-types-chocolate-covered-espresso-beans.C3bdjUHE_qjEcY.webp)**#5** Delicately remove them with a pair of tongs and place them on a baking sheet.**#6** Put your coffee beans in the fridge for about 30 minutes (or until the frosting has completely hardened).**#7** Immerse your coffee beans in melted chocolate again and repeat the whole procedure.**#8** After another 30 minutes in the fridge, repeat the procedure one more time.**#9** Sprinkle milk chocolate coffee beans with the remaining grated coconut and place them all back in the fridge.**#10** Let the chocolate-covered coffee beans rest in the fridge for one night (or at least 6/7 hours) before consumption, to make sure the chocolate frosting has properly hardened.![Chocolate Covered Coffee Beans in jar](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/finished-chocolate-covered-coffee.DD3RK1Mp_1QEmXA.webp) ### Best Coffee for Chocolate Covered Beans You might wonder what kind of coffee beans are best for making these original sweets. Let’s explore the different possibilities. #### Coffee Roast Level When making chocolate-covered coffee beans, aim for a medium to medium-dark roast. Lighter roasts can taste acidic, whereas darker roasts can taste bitter. Aim for the middle.![Chart showing different coffee roast levels by color](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/Roasting_Card_image.DSUG2bPg_ZcRjkb.webp)_Use beans in the 2 to 5 range for best results—chart courtesy of INeedCoffee contributor Len Brault._  #### Coffee Varietals**Coffee Arabica:** Arabica is native to Ethiopia and it produces small and flattened beans. Despite their size, they’re very aromatic and fragrant. This is the most common varietal in specialty coffee and is likely what you will use for this recipe.**Coffee Robusta:** Robusta is native to Congo and its beans are round-shaped and very rich in caffeine. For this reason, they are also very bitter, so they are not a good choice for this recipe. It is preferable to taste this variety of coffee as a drink when blended with Arabica.**Coffee Liberica:** Liberica is native to Liberia and it has big and well-shaped beans. It is not a prized variety, but it is well-suited for this preparation.**Coffee Excelsa:** Excelsa is a recent variety (it was only discovered in 1904) native to Northern Africa. Its beans have a medium size and their aroma is very similar to the Arabica ones so they are the perfect choice for this recipe. ### Conclusion There are many recipes online for making chocolate-covered coffee or espresso beans that are more basic. This recipe combines the strengths of three different forms of chocolate along with the heat from chili powder and the sweetness of coconut to make something special.

# How To Make Coffee Using A Thermos Flask [Brewing Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/brewing-coffee/)---by [Allen J Pais](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/allen-j-pais/)![How To Make Coffee Using A Thermos Flask](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/how-to-make-coffee-using-a-thermos-flask/how-to-make-thermos-coffee.jpg) There are various methods for creating a tasty cup of coffee and I was always looking for a cost-effective method, where the process is simplified with not many dramas involved. As a young boy, I used to see my mother prepare this lovely cup of coffee at home every single morning, with not much effort, and I used to wonder how. I would watch the coffee come out of a Thermos flask every morning into a stainless steel cup, and my mother used to present this coffee every morning. I was not very curious to know more about it as long as I got my coffee. This process continued for a long period until I grew to become a young man. Then one day I again came across this process in our family home. I learned that this coffee brewing method was an old PAIS family process method practiced for ages. The golden moments were finally established, my curiosity vanished and I came to know how this lovely coffee was made. The process was very simple. Roasted coffee beans were ground to a powder and placed into a Thermos or other hot water storage flask. Hot water was added and then the flask was sealed, where the brewing would take place initially and remain hot. Let’s make some Thermos coffee. ### #1 Grind Coffee Place one tablespoon of coarsely ground coffee powder for a cup of coffee you wish to make. I normally powder grind my coffee beans using a mortar and pestle.![course ground coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/course-ground-coffee.D7lY2Sg0_q3vpi.webp) ### #2 Add Ground Coffee to Thermos Place the ground coffee into the hot water storage flask.![add ground coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/add-ground-coffee-powder.DBCP-pc0_rxrv0.webp) ### #3 Fill Thermos with Hot Water Add hot water off the boil to the flask and immediately close the lid. Preferably, do this process at night before you sleep so the coffee is ready in the morning.![pour hot water](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/pouring-hot-water.DN675VCA_Z1SFhI2.webp)![close the flask](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/closing-the-flask.ZY5wRBQP_Z2fhbeH.webp) ### #4 Wait a Few Hours and then Flip the Thermos After waiting a few hours (or overnight), turn the flask upside down 180 degrees. Do this a few times gently (around 3-5 times) and then return it back to its normal position. The coffee brewing happens only instantly when the hot water is mixed with the coffee grounds, which prevents the coffee from over-extracting and tasting too strongly. If however, you discover the taste is too strong, you can reduce the amount of ground coffee added to your flask on the next brew. Wait thirty additional minutes for the coffee grounds to settle down.![wait 2-3 hours](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/waiting-2-3-hours.BFK7IMka_20bWnj.webp)![turn 180 degrees](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/turning-180-deg.B65ocnyS_Z1xODte.webp) ### #5 Open the Thermos and Serve Open the flask lid. You are now ready to pour the aromatic coffee into a cup. By allowing 30 minutes for the grounds to settle, you will have a clean cup of coffee. If however, you are getting grinds, you can pour the coffee over a paper filter before serving. A good hot water storage flask will retain enough heat overnight for a hot cup of coffee. If your model cools too much, you can always heat up the coffee in a microwave. Add milk and sugar as required.![pour hot coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/pouring-hot-coffee.kd2rvZvj_SJiiI.webp)![add milk to coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/adding-milk-to-coffee.CWcGqKli_Z15JIoz.webp) ### Video Tutorial Below is a 3-minute video tutorial for this coffee brewing method. [How To Make Coffee Using A Thermos Flask](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aElc_ZuLFbk) (YouTube) ### Last Words If you do this process once, you will never want any other mechanized process, and you will enjoy a hot cup of coffee every day. The effortless method will give you sufficient time to do all your other activities every morning rather than bothering yourself with a lot of time to make that critical cup of coffee. ### Resources [How To Make Coffee Using A Thermos Flask](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aElc_ZuLFbk) – 3-minute video on YouTube [Coffee Brewing Guide](https://ineedcoffee.com/coffee-brewing-guide/) – More coffee brewing tutorials here on INeedCoffee.

# How Hard is a Hario Pour Over? [Brewing Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/brewing-coffee/)---by [Samantha Joyce](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/samantha-joyce/) We’ve all heard the rumors that the Hario V60 has a reputation for being a difficult brew method. On a recent visit, Jeff Babcock, the owner of Zoka Coffee in Seattle, told me that a Hario pour-over was his preferred brew method. He is a judge in the _Cup of Excellence_, so I trust him as an authority on taste. I decided to break out of my daily Chemex coffee routine and try Hario. Compared to a French press, the Hario brews a clear cup of coffee with no sediment. Compared to Chemex, the thinner paper filter of a Hario allows more of the natural coffee oil and flavor to be present in the finished cup. Is it worth the fuss, though? Equipment list: - Hario V60 Ceramic Dripper 02-Medium (comes with plastic coffee measuring scoop) - Hario V60 Coffee Paper Filters 02-Medium - Hario V60 Glass Server - Hario V60 Drip Station - Hario V60 Drip Scale - Hario Buono Coffee Drip Kettle - Baratza Encore burr grinder - Mavea Water Filtration Pitcher - Equator Coffee Mocha Java Organic Fair Trade Blend![Hario setup](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/hario-setup1.D5Gg7Or0_ZRVaqv.webp) Brewing steps for the Hario V60 Pour Over Station: 1. Place the stand on the scale. Place the dripper on the stand and the carafe under the stand. 2. Pre-rinse the paper filter in place in the dripper with boiling water. Don’t skip this step. This also serves to warm up your dripper and carafe. Discard this water from the carafe below. 3. Grind fresh whole-bean coffee in a fine drip setting. Particle consistency is very important for an even extraction. Use a burr grinder or purchase pre-ground coffee. Do not use a blade grinder.![Hario - Add coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/hario-step-1.BKcEsc7U_1x1RYH.webp) 4. Re-set the tare weight for the completed setup so that it reads zero. Add two level Hario measuring scoops of coffee into the pre-moistened filter. This equals about 24 grams of coffee. Depending on your coffee and taste preference you may like to experiment with this dosage. Re-set the tare weight again.![Hario - weigh](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/hario-step-1b.DTkgML_q_11Al0C.webp) 5. Add about 50 grams of water just to evenly moisten the grounds. Depending on the coffee varietal you select, the water temperature needs to be around 97C/206F for proper extraction. A variable temperature gooseneck kettle makes this step easier. The precision offered by the gooseneck is almost mandatory to get the water to the right location.![Hario Add water](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/hario-step-2.KuUosM8O_zKYdA.webp) 6. Pause. Take a deep breath. Inhale the aroma. You can do this! 7. Start in the center and in small concentric circles. Work your way out but not to the point of watering around the edges. Continue the pour until the scale reads a total of 390 grams of water added.![Hario Brewing](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/hario-step-3.CldvszgU_Z19hqKB.webp) 8. This takes about two minutes. Don’t rush it. If you do not have a scale, you can slowly add 12-14 ounces of water using a measuring cup with a good pour spout. The cup that I brewed today was lovely and took care and concentration. I’m sure over time my directional pouring skills will improve and I will feel more comfortable. I once saw a barista at Coava Coffee Roasters in Portland make two pour-overs at once with a Hario Buono kettle in each hand! I was in awe. Hario pour-overs don’t deserve to be labeled difficult. The right equipment makes it very easy for anyone to prepare. Due to the initial costs, the precise measurements used, and the small yield produced, it may not be everyone’s first choice brew method. However, if the taste is your main concern, then a Hario V60 is a time-tested prep to add to your arsenal of coffee accouterments. ### Resources [How Make V60 Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/how-to-make-v60-coffee/) – INeedCoffee tutorial.

# How to Make Iced Coffee With the Gabi Drip Master [Brewing Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/brewing-coffee/)---by [Michael Allen Smith](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/michael-allen-smith/)![How to Make Iced Coffee With the Gabi Drip Master](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/how-to-make-iced-coffee-with-the-gabi-drip-master/make-iced-coffee-gabi.jpg) In my previous article,  [How to Make Pour-Over Coffee With the Gabi Drip Master](https://ineedcoffee.com/make-pour-coffee-gabi-drip-master/), I showed you an innovative coffee dripper that simplified pour-over coffee in a few ways. Besides the cool waterspout, which controls the flow of water over the grounds in a slow, controlled manner, the Gabi Drip Master’s top chamber was designed to hold exactly 150 grams of water. This means you don’t need to weigh the water or babysit the pour-over. Just fill the chamber twice. A few weeks ago, I got the idea that the Gabi has the perfect design for making iced coffee. ### Iced Coffee Iced coffee is different from the more popular cold brew. Cold Brew takes hours to make, whereas Iced Coffee takes minutes. From the tutorial  [A Clever Way To Make Iced Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/clever-way-make-iced-coffee/): > Iced Coffee, which is also referred to as Japanese Iced Coffee, is made by brewing coffee directly over ice. This instantly chills the coffee, while preserving the flavor. To avoid having a watery coffee, the amount of water used when brewing is split between the hot water and the ice. Many coffee aficionados prefer iced coffee to cold brew as it tends to taste like a chilled refreshing version of that hot coffee. Whatever acidity level or flavor notes the hot version has will remain. And if you get the water ratio right it won’t taste weak. ### The Ratio A typical ratio for iced coffee is 60% hot water and 40% ice by weight. I placed the Gabi on my digital scale, zeroed it out, and loaded it with ice cubes. The ice cubes were heaping above the top of the brewer. The scale showed 111 grams. If the hot water is 150 grams, that works out to 57% hot water. Perfect! Let’s brew some iced coffee. ### #1 Fill the Gabi Top Chamber with Ice Cubes You won’t need a scale. Just pile ice cubes into the top chamber of your Gabi until they look like this photo. If your ice cubes are smaller, they will take up more space in the chamber, so use a little less.![weigh ice](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/weigh-ice.DFgdptEr_QIf6Y.webp) ### #2 Move the Ice to a Glass We only used Gabi’s top chamber to measure the ice. Transfer the ice to a glass since the brewed coffee will land on the ice.![transfer ice](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/gabi-iced-coffee-setup.CgcjHIr5_1bVhG0.webp) ### #3 Add Ground Coffee and Place Over Mug Place 20 grams of medium-ground coffee into the filter. Place the filter into the Dripper and then set the Dripper over the glass holding the ice.![Gabi Dripper iced Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/iced-coffee-with-gabi.qGzdkNUg_Z2bjPI8.webp) ### #4 Place the Connected Water Bottle / Waterspout Over the Dripper Place the connected Water Bottle and Waterspout onto the Dripper. Now the brew stack is complete. ### #5 Add Water Heat water to 200° F. Fill the Water Bottle to the top **just once**.![](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/brewing-iced-coffee.CQpuSZ9y_1hJPwm.webp)![iced coffee on the gabi dripper](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/gabi-iced-coffee.DOfniE-X_UjEm.webp) ### #6 Remove Brewer and Enjoy! That is it—a super-easy way to make iced coffee.![Finished Iced Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/finished-iced-coffee.C1-dvkx-_1A50HI.webp) ### Conclusion My hunch that the Gabi Dripper would be the perfect way to make Iced Coffee without doing math was correct. When filled with ice, the top chamber holds about 40% of the water weight for a brew, which is ideal for iced coffee. The flavor was light and refreshing, exactly what I want from iced coffee. If you desire a stronger iced coffee, look into using a Clever, as you can extend the length of the brew with that dripper. ### Resources [How to Make Pour-Over Coffee With the Gabi Drip Master](https://ineedcoffee.com/make-pour-coffee-gabi-drip-master/) – Tutorial and review of the Gabi Dripper.

# How to Make V60 Coffee [Brewing Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/brewing-coffee/)---by [Joseph Robertson](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/joseph-robertson/)![How to Make V60 Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/how-to-make-v60-coffee/How-to-Make-V60-Coffee.jpg) One of the things I love about crafting a great cup of coffee is just how easy it actually can be to make a good one consistently. But most of the time, this rules out certain brewing methods. I used to recommend the V60 as a great beginner brewing method. It looks so simple, doesn’t it? It’s a cone, you add coffee, you pour water—what’s so complicated? Unlike most pour-over brewing methods, the entire brew of the coffee is completely in your hands. You control every key variable – and you probably don’t realize that. Coffee brewing using pour-over methods is all about getting the water to extract the coffee as it passes the grounds. Most of the time, the main variable you control is the grind size. So if you want to adjust how your coffee tastes, you adjust the size of your grind and that’s it. With the V60, it is built such that there is no restriction on the flow of water by the vessel. You have control over this flow. It means when you change your grind size it not only changes the surface area the water has available to extract coffee, it also changes how much time that water is in contact with the coffee. In short, it’s easy to dive in, but difficult to master. Understanding the extraction variables of brewing on a V60 is a deep rabbit hole, filled with timers, spreadsheets, and tons of videos of people doing all sorts of fun things. I’m here to give you an easy process to brew a great V60, consistently. Let’s give you the tools to dive in. If you want to explore the rabbit hole further, that will be up to you… ### Things You Will Need: #### A Gooseneck Kettle For brewing on the V60, you must have a slow-pouring Kettle, typically a gooseneck. The speed and delicacy with which you add water to the coffee are critical. If you have a typical water kettle, you are only going to be sloshing water into the brewer. This imprecision will lead to inconsistent coffee brewing. I am a big fan of Fellow’s Kettle. #### A Scale You can’t brew a consistent V60 if you aren’t weighing your coffee and your water. #### The V60, Filters, Etc This is probably obvious, but you need a V60, the filters, and something to brew into. There are several different V60s, and the material version you get is a personal preference. The only thing it will impact (aside from how you feel about using it) is the temperature. More solid material V60s like porcelain or copper will require more attentive preheating so that they don’t drop your brew temperature when you start brewing (some would argue these brewers also hold brew temperature better, but I haven’t verified this). #### The Coffee If you are going to take the time to brew such a handcrafted brew, you might as well get yourself some great coffee. One of my top recommendations is Conduit Coffee – grab one of their single origins. Let’s Get Brewing ### #1 Grind Coffee Using the Coffee Grind Chart, find yourself a [medium-fine grind](https://ineedcoffee.com/coffee-grind-chart/). The V60 will brew well from fine all the way to coarse depending on methods, but to start out, we’ll use a traditional medium-fine grind.![v60 coffee grind size](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/v60-1-GrindSize.CzalfiHT_1hbMKN.webp)_Coffee grind size for V60 Coffee_### #2 Rinse Your Filter It’s important to rinse your filter when brewing on the V60 – both to remove paper taste and also to preheat the brewing vessel (there’s also an argument to be made about how the filter gets to set the brewer as it’s rinsed – but I don’t have any testing to back up the importance of this aspect). On preheating, different V60 brewing methods will interact with the heat of the brew in different ways. It is possible to have a brewer pull so much heat out of the brew that you dip too low and end up with a poor extraction. In short, just preheat your brewer with near-boiling water.![v60 coffee rinse filter](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/v60-2-RinseFilter.DfsP7cqF_Z1S0Y2d.webp)_Rinse paper filter_### #3 Add Your Grounds I like a standard 16:1 (water to coffee) ratio for brewing on the V60. All the steps below will be the same regardless of how much coffee you use. For this example, I used 25 grams of coffee brewing with 400 grams of water.![v60 coffee add grounds](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/v60-3-AddGrounds.9RZvH1P7_1eP15m.webp)_Add coffee grounds_### #4 The Bloom The first pour will give us our ‘bloom’ – the water contacts the grounds, releasing gases, and puffing up the brew bed, making the appearance of blooming. This is important for getting those gasses out of the way of the brewing process and preparing the grounds for full extraction. Extracting coffee is all about water pulling the soluble compounds out of the coffee grounds. Saturated grounds will more readily release these compounds. Think about it like pouring water on a flower bed that’s dry vs wet. In the dry flower bed, the water will just run off. In the moist flower bed, the water becomes absorbed. This is a similar interaction. For the bloom, I add 1.5-2x the grams of water as there are coffee grounds. So, for 25 grams of coffee, I’ll add 40-50 grams of water to bloom (just make sure you cover the grounds and nothing appears dry). Then wait 30-45 seconds (I wait until the ground bed stops moving).![v60 coffee bloom](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/v60-4-TheBloom1.CPjeyMXy_Z2p8W1N.webp)_The Bloom #1_![v60 coffee bloom 2](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/v60-4-TheBloom2.C_lL3lqo_23fdLE.webp)_The Bloom #2_![v60 coffee bloom 3](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/v60-4-TheBloom3.BCGjqVwg_ZhuRGD.webp)_The Bloom #3_### #5 The First Pour I tend to split my pouring of the V60 into 2 to 4 sets of pours. I like to take this more casual approach because it requires less mental energy to process, yet I still get a consistently good-tasting brew. I think it’s a good place to start. You’ll find other methods which have very strict pour measurements. After the bloom is completed, start the first pour. I pour slowly using concentric circles to evenly distribute water over the grounds. If you were to just pour straight into the middle, you’d have an uneven flow of water through the grounds, which would reduce the quality of your brew. Just pour in circles and evenly cover everything with water. In the first pour, I’ll pour until about 2/3 of the brewer is filled – I like to leave a bit of space towards the top for the next step. When brewing with 25 grams of coffee, this step usually takes me from 100-150 grams of water, depending on how fast I pour.![v60 coffee first pour](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/v60-5-TheFirstPour1.BO5UbohD_Z1tRuFe.webp)_The First Pour #1_![v60 coffee firs pour 2](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/v60-5-TheFirstPour2.DdpE4YSw_1CXUTE.webp)_The First Pour #2_### #6 The Spin After the first pour, I pick the V60 just off the carafe and give it a little spin, knocking grounds off the side of the brewer. This also helps make sure that all the grounds and water are evenly saturated. I find doing this early on leads to a sweeter and better-tasting coffee (due to more even extraction throughout the brew).![v60 coffee - the spin](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/v60-6-TheSpin.B8WbjIRe_KwlyU.webp)_The Spin_### #7 Pours 2-4 After the first spin, I’ll allow the water to ‘draw down’ more through the coffee before I continue pouring. From here I and mostly eyeballing, but I make sure to start pouring a little bit before the water level meets the ground level. When you do start pouring again, do so gently. You want to disturb the grounds as little as possible. In each of these continued pours, I’ll pour right up to the previous pour level, let the water brew down, and then continue until I’ve reached my final weight of 400 grams.![v60 coffee - more pours](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/v60-7-MorePours.Ci-05tE9_1txR5T.webp)_Additional Pours_### #8 The Final Spin I’ll add one more final spin after adding the last bit of water, just to make sure there’s a full, even extraction going through to the end.![v60 coffee final spin](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/v60-8-LastSpin.Bn-yPmBP_Zk1R2Y.webp)_The Final Spin_![v60 coffee done](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/v60-9-V60Done2.D9oZEtoK_Z2ReMk.webp)_Finishing_### #9 Finished Serve and enjoy. ### Resources [How to Brew V60 – A Coffee Lovers Brewing Guide](https://youtu.be/bZ9eJ4D0vbo) (Video tutorial of this article on YouTube) For a more detailed article on the V60, check out issue [#59 of Extracted Magazine](https://www.extractedmagazine.com/brewing-on-the-v60-issue-59/). _Title photo background by [Ben Kolde](https://unsplash.com/@benkolde)._ Published on November 9, 2024--- #### Joseph Robertson [Follow Joseph Robertson on X](https://x.com/extractedmag)Extracted Magazine is a digital publication guiding coffee drinkers of all levels towards connoisseurship through exploring the craft of coffee and the people/companies involved.

# How to Make Pour Over Coffee Using a Cloth [Brewing Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/brewing-coffee/)---by [Allen J Pais](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/allen-j-pais/)![How to Make Pour Over Coffee Using a Cloth](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/how-to-make-pour-over-coffee-using-a-cloth/pour-over-cloth.jpg) My life is dedicated to coffee growth, cultivation, and re-discovering the past in relation to the various methods of coffee brewing. I capture the past with faint memories of my mother preparing coffee. These memories help me recreate methods of coffee brewing. Then, I rehearsed the same scenario, and I got to know a perfect method of how we brewed coffee in the past. ### History It was around 1975 when I would see my mother get up early in the morning to prepare pour-over coffee. She used a medium-sized copper vessel, covering the top of the vessel with a muslin cloth tied to the brim of the vessel. That cloth would cover, strain, and filter the coffee grinds. She used a pre-ground coffee powder made of a mixture of roasted Robusta and Arabica. Depending on the number of members in the house, she would put a few tablespoons onto the cloth area that was immersed in the vessel. My mother would heat hot water using a kettle made of aluminum. The kettle was heated using a wood fire and the stovetop was designed by my dad to heat water for bathing, which was stored in an oil drum, that had an outlet to a cooktop. The water was drawn out from the well. Once the water was heated, she would pour the hot water from the kettle’s goose-necked spout on top of the coffee grinds in a circular motion. After waiting for 3 to 5 minutes, the cloth would be removed and squeezed by hand using a serving spoon to get every drop of the coffee brew. There would be a cake of coffee-soaked grounds left inside the cloth which was thrown away below the plants as compost. Finally, the coffee decoction would be available in the vessel. I remember the flavor was rich with coffee brew aroma, as it was poured into small ceramic or steel cups. With the addition of milk and sugar to taste, the end result was a lovely cup of coffee every day early in the morning. Let us make some coffee. ### The Pour-over Coffee Method using a cloth_Re-Creating & Demonstrating, 1975 (45 years ago) Coffee brewing process in 2020._#### #1 Grind Coffee Place one tablespoon of ground coffee powder for each cup of coffee you wish to make. I normally powder grind my coffee bean using a mortar and pestle. I use an 80% Arabica and 20% Robusta blend. Use whatever coffee or blend you prefer.![coffee ground mix](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/brew-coffee-grounds.No7_zVtZ_Z2wCFXI.webp) #### #2 Prepare a Muslin Cloth Prepare a white muslin cloth or a multipurpose cheesecloth for your vessel or ceramic pot.![prep cloth for brewing](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/brew-prep-cloth.SqrECQma_1KuXFq.webp) #### #3 Add Coffee Grinds on top of the Cloth Verify the cloth is secured correctly on the brim with a thread, then push the cloth down to be able to hold the grinds and poured hot water.![add coffee to cloth](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/brew-prep-cloth2.DpwpGDQ-_Z2ic9QD.webp) #### #4 Add hot water to coffee grounds Pour hot water in a circular motion, and protect yourself from coming in contact with hot water. Once the water drains through the cloth into the pot, it is time to squeeze the remaining coffee. The process of pouring hot water and transferring the hot coffee into a cup is approximately 3-5 minutes.![add hot water](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/brew-pour-water.Cx2oWqUw_1EeXky.webp) #### #5 Squeeze the Coffee Grind Cloth Use kitchen tongs to squeeze the cloth and strain the coffee brew if required.![squeeze cloth](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/brew-squeeze-cloth.KqbWi8Ma_Z1Pcvzj.webp) #### #6 Pour the Coffee decoction into a Ceramic Cup Gently pour the Coffee decoction into a cup. You can use a strainer if required. Throw away the remaining soaked grinds into your garden pot.  The cloth can be reused by rinsing it with clean water.![pour coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/brew-pour-coffee.COmkYirE_4VYTW.webp) #### #7 Add milk and sugar to taste Add milk and sugar to taste. You can reheat the coffee if required.

# I-Roast 2 Coffee Roasting Guide [Roasting Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/roasting-coffee/)---by [Chris Arnold](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/chris-arnold/)![I-Roast 2 Coffee Roasting Guide](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/i-roast-2-coffee-roasting-guide/roast2.jpg) So you bought an iRoast2, and your roasts are coming out too dark or too light, or you feel the flavor could be better. Maybe you are generally happy, but think you could get more from the iRoast 2. Or maybe you just want to see how others use theirs. Hopefully, we can give you some tips to help you get more from the ever-popular Hearthware i-Roast2. Please note that although this article is written specifically for the i-Roast 2, many of the principles apply equally well to the original iRoast 1 models. First, we should say that these Hearthware units are actually quite cheap in the grand scheme of things, and as such, have fairly wide variances between units. Basically, this means that if your buddy buys an iRoast2, and you buy an iRoast2, a given profile on your machine will likely not produce the same roast as a given profile on his machine. Not only that, but the voltage coming out of the wall at your house can have a moderate effect on how your roast turns out. And since the voltage in most homes fluctuates on an almost minute-by-minute basis, your roast success can depend in some part on keeping that in check and trying to compensate if possible. More on that later. ### A Word About Profiles A profile is simply a list of instructions (called stages) programmed into the iRoast2 unit. It tells the unit what temperature you want it to run at, and for what length of time. The original iRoast allows for 5 profiles with 3 stages each, whereas the iRoast2 allows for 10 profiles with 5 stages each. Another small note: The iRoast 1 will lose any programming you enter when unplugged. This was fixed in the iRoast 2, which alone is reason enough to upgrade to the i-Roast2. Here is an example of a typical 5 stage profile just to give you an idea of what a profile might look like. This profile also includes good notes from previous roast experiments. (HINT: Take good notes!) You do not need to use all of the stages available, although you might as well if they are there, as it will make for a smoother profile. ### Sample Profile 1 Brazil Poco Fundo 115 VAC 5.3 Ounces (150 Grams) Stopped at Stage 5 with just 30 seconds left About 15 seconds into 2nd crack Stage 1 370F 5 Minutes 15 min left Stage 2 390F 4 Minutes 10 min left Stage 3 405F 3 Minutes 6 min left Stage 4 420F 2 Minutes 3 min left Stage 5 440F 1 Minute 1 min left COOLING NA 4 Minutes 0 min left Note that the temperatures listed above do not indicate the actual temperature of the bean. Don’t worry. We will give you some sample profiles to get you started. ### A Word About Voltage WARNING – YOU CAN DIE IF YOU DO NOT KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING. IF IN DOUBT, CALL A LICENSED ELECTRICIAN. You can use a simple AC Volt Meter to check the AC Voltage. Please see manufacturer instructions for safe use. Better yet, you can also use a device that tells you a little more info, and just plugs right in. One such device is branded as Kill-a-Watt. Although originally designed to show you how much energy and money you are using on a given electrical device, the Kill a Watt works great for this application. The main advantage is that it just plugs into the wall outlet and your roaster plugs into the Killawatt. Now you can monitor the voltage in real-time, and see the actual voltage as your roaster is operating.![Voltage before Roasting](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/killawatt11.BmgkX-ba_DMcII.webp)_Voltage before Roasting_![Voltage while Roasting](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/killawatt2.BXNafqmB_FSD6J.webp)_Voltage while Roasting_ Now you know the voltage, what can you do about it? Well for one thing you can know that a given profile at a given voltage works for a given bean. Next time you go to roast that same bean with that same profile, but with a different voltage, it will likely result in a less than perfect roast. A higher voltage usually means a faster/darker roast, and a lower voltage a slower/lighter roast. There are two solutions to this problem. The first solution involves the use of something called a Variac. We will not go into detail in this article, but a Variac can make the voltage output run at a steady output, regardless of the input voltage (within a range, of course). Please stay tuned for an upcoming article on Variacs and coffee roasters. The second solution involves simply having three or more profiles to account for voltage fluctuations. Since my voltage fluctuates between 110 and 120 volts, I picked 115 as my baseline and developed a profile for that voltage. I then made one that was slower and ended with a lower final temperature for the days when the voltage was high and one that was faster and ended with a higher final temperature for the days when the voltage was low. Of course, this eats two additional slots in my 10 profile capacity iRoast2, but I found it was worth it. You may also find that different outlets have different voltages. Sometimes, it is just a matter of finding an outlet that gives you the voltage you are seeking.![iroast2-roast-start](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/iroast2-roast-start.BBG63eh8_Z17sVtv.webp)_Start of Roast_![iroast2-roast-underway](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/iroast2-roast-underway.8sDQuApt_Z9NvkI.webp)_Roast underway_![iroast2-1st-crack](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/iroast2-1st-crack-593x650.D4YgX6cK_Z1cmik1.webp)_1st Crack_![iroast2-2nd-crack](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/iroast2-2nd-crack.DbYgYbDw_Z14199L.webp)_2nd Crack – Roast ready to end. Can you see what went wrong here?_ Notice in the last picture how there is 5:30 left and yet I am already in the second crack? That means we have a roast that is less than 10 minutes. Ideally, you want about 12-15 minutes of total roast time. Why did I have a problem? Because I had not used this particular bean with this particular profile. So I have some work to do! See, it is OK to fail. You are going to have a lot more failures than successes, at least in the beginning. ### Top Ten Tips To Successful Roasting With the IROAST 1. Monitor the roast from start to finish as fires can break out. 2. Be ready to hit the cool button if the roast is getting too dark or is producing too much smoke. 3. After every roast, empty the chaff collector very well and make sure the screen is completely free of debris (use a soft brush if necessary). 4. A dark roast is not usually a flavorful roast, as many of the nuances are killed if taken too far into the second crack. 5. Trying to stretch the first crack and the second crack can result in a sweeter roast, which may be ideal for espresso. 6. Trying a shorter/faster roast will result in a brighter roast, which may be ideal for drip or even French Press (Press Pot). 7. Both second and first crack can be hard to hear with the “I-Roar”. You may need to get close and move your head in order to hear the cracks. 8. Always use the same amount of green coffee (5.3 ounces or 150 grams is suggested). Get a digital scale if necessary. 9. Stick with one green coffee varietal until you get it right. Buy 5 pounds or more to ensure you do not run out before dialing in a given bean. 10. Keep voltage monitored and in check, adjusting your roast profiles or using a Variac to compensate. Remember to experiment, and keep good notes on all aspects of the process. And don’t forget to have fun! ### Some Profiles To Get You Started SAMPLE PROFILE 1A (For Low Voltage Days ~110 VAC) Stage 1 380F 5 Minutes 15 min left Stage 2 400F 4 Minutes 10 min left Stage 3 420F 3 Minutes 6 min left Stage 4 440F 2 Minutes 3 min left Stage 5 460F 1 Minute 1 min left COOLING NA 4 Minutes 0 min left SAMPLE PROFILE 1B (For Regular Voltage Days ~115 VAC) Stage 1 370F 5 Minutes 15 min left Stage 2 385F 4 Minutes 10 min left Stage 3 400F 3 Minutes 6 min left Stage 4 415F 2 Minutes 3 min left Stage 5 430F 1 Minute 1 min left COOLING NA 4 Minutes 0 min left SAMPLE PROFILE 1C (For High Voltage Days ~120 VAC) Stage 1 360F 5 Minutes 15 min left Stage 2 370F 4 Minutes 10 min left Stage 3 380F 3 Minutes 6 min left Stage 4 390F 2 Minutes 3 min left Stage 5 400F 1 Minute 1 min left COOLING NA 4 Minutes 0 min left ### Resources_iRoast 2 (no longer available)_ Published on August 1, 2007--- #### Chris Arnold Chris is the creator of Two Bit History.

# How to Store Coffee Beans (Tips and Recommendations) [Brewing Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/brewing-coffee/)---by [Michael Allen Smith](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/michael-allen-smith/)![How to Store Coffee Beans (Tips and Recommendations)](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/how-to-store-coffee-beans-tips-and-recommendations/store-coffee-beans.jpg) One of the most asked questions about coffee is: _What is the best way to store coffee?_ This article will review the best ways to keep the coffee you purchase fresher and longer. We will also cover what not to do and end with product recommendations for storing coffee beans. ### Buy Fresh It must be said that no matter how well you store your coffee beans at home, if you buy older coffee, your coffee will not be at its best. Many bags of stale coffee line grocery store shelves. You’ll want to look for a roast date on the bag. Even if the bag is vacuum-sealed, time is the enemy. If you do not see a roast date, assume it is stale and find another option. Darker roasts are less forgiving than lighter roasts. If you like darker coffee, look for coffee a few days off roast. Lighter roasts can be 1-2 weeks old. Sometimes, even 3 weeks. If you are making cold brew coffee, you can use older coffee. Here in Seattle, I figured out that my favorite roaster made their fresh coffee delivery to stores on Friday afternoons. Guess when I timed my grocery store visit? That evening. ### Whole Bean vs Ground Coffee Because of its much greater surface area, ground coffee will go stale much faster than whole beans. Grinding your coffee at home just prior to brewing is a very important step for maximizing coffee freshness. If you can’t grind coffee at home, buying smaller amounts of coffee more frequently is your best plan. ### The Enemy of Coffee Freshness Coffee freshness has five enemies. 1. Moisture 2. Air 3. Heat 4. Light 5. Depth of Roast #### Moisture The worst thing you can do is store your coffee in the refrigerator. Not only is it a moist environment, but the coffee can absorb the flavors of the food being stored in the frig. The freezer is more complicated. Generally, coffee should be kept out of the freezer for similar reasons. However, if you have a lot of coffee you want to save, placing those beans in an airtight freezer bag is not a bad idea. Taking coffee in and out of the freezer repeatedly is not advised. #### Air Like other perishable food items, coffee begins to lose its flavor potential when exposed to air. Sealing coffee in a bag or container is one of the most important things you can do to extend the life of your coffee. #### Heat I never thought much about heat’s role in coffee freshness until a few years ago. I visited a coffee shop that kept their coffee in bags next to a window where the sun was beating down. Despite having access to the fresh coffee delivered by the roaster, the coffee there tasted stale. The coffee was fine, as I had at a different coffee shop before. The heat had destroyed the flavor. Keep your coffee away from heat to extend its freshness. #### Light Light exposure is probably the least violated rule of coffee storage. Unless you are taking the coffee out of its bag, placing it in a glass container, and storing it in the open, you are likely fine. Just note that coffee prefers darkness. #### Depth of Roast Other coffee sites that tackle the subject of coffee storage never seem to mention the role roast level plays in the coffee freshness equation. Darker roasted coffees, regardless of how they are stored, go stale quicker than lighter roasted coffees. Coffees taken to French Roast or Italian Roast are more porous than lighter-roasted coffees. From the article  [Hacking Dark Roast – Tips on Brewing a Better Bold Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/hacking-dark-roast-tips-on-brewing-a-better-bold-coffee/): > When coffee is roasted well into and even beyond the second crack, the structure of the coffee bean is more fragile and porous. This greatly shortens the window of freshness. I talked with one Seattle roaster that told me a dark French roast coffee might start to taste flat in as little as four days. That is four days from roast. You can try and seal the coffee as best as you can to preserve and extend freshness, but a heavily roasted coffee will age faster. There are three solutions for the dark roast fan: 1. Make more frequent purchases of smaller amounts of coffee. Time your purchases close to the roast date. 2. Shift to a medium-dark roast to extend the freshness window. 3. Start the rewarding hobby of home-roasting, so you are guaranteed to get fresh coffee in the exact amounts you want. Plus, you’ll save money. All you need is a porch and an old popcorn popper. ([Roasting Coffee in a Popcorn Popper](https://ineedcoffee.com/roasting-coffee-in-a-popcorn-popper/)) ### Coffee Storage Options Now that we know what not to do with coffee, let’s explore the options for storing it correctly. #### #1 Cabinet The simplest solution is to seal the coffee bag and place it in a cabinet as best as possible. It will be away from moisture, light, and heat. #### #2 Jars, Containers Phase two involves placing the coffee in a jar or other kitchen container and then storing it in a dark cabinet (if it is glass). I had used this method for many years, especially when I had many different home-roasting samples. #### #3 Vacuum-Sealed Containers Today, I use a vacuum-sealed container. My coffee never goes stale. The first cup of the bag tastes just as good as the last. And this is the ideal situation. Ankomn makes a vacuum-seal container that seals with a quick turn.![vacuum seal coffee storage](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/vacuum-coffee-storage.B3AXbHOn_ZPaCH2.webp)_Ankomn Turn-N-Seal Container_### Putting it All Together To maximize coffee freshness, we will only buy fresh coffee, especially if we prefer darker roasted coffee. Ideally, we will grind the coffee just before brewing, but if we can’t, we’ll still do our best to keep the coffee fresh. We will keep the coffee out of the refrigerator. We won’t purchase too much coffee at once to minimize the chance some will go flat. If we do buy too much coffee, we can store it in an airtight freezer-safe bag in the freezer and then move it to room-temperature storage when we are ready to consume it. At a minimum, we will keep coffee sealed in its bag and stored in a dark cabinet. The next step is to find a jar or container to place the coffee in, eventually graduating to a vacuum-sealed solution. ### Resources [Coffee Storage](https://ineedcoffee.com/coffee-storage/)—Our original article dives deeper into the best way to use the freezer to store coffee.

# How to Stereotype Roasters [Coffee Business](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/coffee-business/)---by [Michael Allen Smith](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/michael-allen-smith/)![How to Stereotype Roasters](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/how-to-stereotype-roasters/coffee-roaster1.jpg) In the spirit of [Stereotyping Coffeehouses](https://ineedcoffee.com/coffee-house-stereotyping/), I’ve decided that learning how to distinguish good roasters from the bad is just as crucial without trying the wares. Stereotyping a roaster is relatively easy once you know how to size up an operation. Let’s look over some clues indicating that a coffee roaster is turning out a poor product.![coffee roasting](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/coffee-roaster1.DqPumXs7_1Uv3Cx.webp)_Coffee Roaster_### Flavored Focus Just like a cafe, any roaster who lists flavored coffee above varietals is sure to suck. Selling flavored coffee is something that many roasters do out of financial necessity. They do it to please the bottom rung customer – like a microbrewery that grudgingly keeps bottles of Bud for customers who refuse to expand their beer palate. The good roasters aren’t proud of their flavored coffees and would never display HAZELNUT or SNICKERDOODLE over one of their creative blends. A bad roaster won’t care. If the roaster places the flavored coffees in a selling location that is too prominent, don’t buy anything from them. ### Crop and Roast Descriptions A good roaster knows the difference between the characteristics of a good crop and a cheap one and, like a proud father, they want you to know everything about the bean. A great roaster will never describe a bean merely by country of origin. They will go into the region and mark. For example, a poor roaster will sell “Costa Rican”, and a better roaster will sell “Costa Rican Tarrazu La Minita”. Some roasters will stop at the regional level. You don’t have to know which regions are good or not; that is the roaster’s job. If the roaster hides that information from you, it doesn’t speak well of what they are trying to sell. ### No Cafe Correlation Unfortunately, we can’t use the Coffee House stereotypes against the roaster. Some of the best roasters I can think of operate the worst cafes. These roast masters devote so much effort to the bean that they neglect the cafe. ### Fooling the Customer A bad roaster will try to make money by exploiting the ignorance of their customers. If some roaster is trying to sell Hawaiian Kona Blend for $17 a pound, they are trying to capitalize on the fact you won’t recognize the last word that says “Blend”. Blend means that there is probably very little Kona in the mix. If a roaster uses the term “Style”, as in “Hawaiian Kona Style” then they are out to pull the wool over your eyes. “Style” means there is no Kona in the blend, and cheaper beans are roasted as if they were Kona. A good roaster will not tack on “Blend” or “Style” to Hawaiian Kona. Their reputation is worth more to them than any possible misunderstanding. Also, beware of roasters that try this trick with Jamaican Blue Mountain. ### 2 Grinders or 1? If the roaster does sell flavored coffee along with the good stuff, how many bean grinders do they have? Flavored coffee should not be ground in the same grinder as non-flavored coffee. Those flavors will drift into the next bean ground in the machine. I don’t want the taste of AMARETTO coffee inside my Kenyan AA. Even if you plan to grind at home, use this test to stereotype the quality of the entire coffee operation. ### Same Style Of Roasting Does every coffee bean at the roaster look like a French roast? A skilled roaster will know that every crop has a sweet spot; some beans are best when roasted lighter, and some are best when roasted dark. A Colombian may excel at a Vienna Roast, but roasting Ethiopian Yirgacheffe that dark is a crime. One arrogant roaster with a big name believes that there is a magical dark roast level perfect for all beans. In actuality, there is no “one roast fits all” solution. ### Ability to Share Knowledge Can the roaster articulate how great their product is? Is the staff able to answer questions about the bean selection? Are the bins marked clearly and with verbose descriptions? Does the roaster provide detailed literature for the customer to take home and read? Ask them to recommend a good coffee and watch how they sell it. A quality roaster will be able to share knowledge about their product. A lesser roaster cannot make a convincing case for any bean. ### In Summary Stereotyping the quality of a given coffee roaster without trying their beans will save your money and taste buds. By using the rules listed above, you will be able to spot a lousy roaster in minutes. These techniques work well if you are physically inside the coffee roaster’s shop.

# How You Brewin’? [Brewing Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/brewing-coffee/)---by [CB Miller](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/cb-miller/)![How You Brewin’?](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/how-you-brewin/4points1.gif) Coffee lovers are snobs, to a point. Once the brewing is complete they can’t refuse a good cup of coffee. They will however argue endlessly as to what technique is best for getting to the cup. There are more brewing methods than we have time, or space, to discuss here. We favor [French Press](https://ineedcoffee.com/press-pot-tutorial/), but again admit that admirable results are possible with the Drip, Percolator, Turkish, [Vacuum Pot](https://ineedcoffee.com/vacuum-pot-brewing/ "Vac-Pot articles"), and of course, Espresso methods to name only the most common. What’s the difference? Don’t be offended, but the difference is often how well prepared you are in the first place. Even brewing methods that have been passed from generation to generation will fail if the pot is dirty, the water less than desirable, and the grind uneven. Start of course with the best, and freshest roasted beans. If you can’t be sure of the quality and freshness of your beans, then everything that follows is pointless. Next grind those beans to proper consistency. Ready to go? Is your equipment scrupulously clean? Soaking a glass flask in soapy water overnight should remove most of that haze, and if not, perhaps you should replace it. Crisp, clean, spring-quality water is also a must. It is surprising how many coffee lovers will buy the most expensive equipment and the rarest beans and yet use foul-tasting tap water to make their coffee every morning. So you’ve controlled all the variables, and that first cup of coffee is fabulous… well don’t just sit there with that goofy look on your face, get that coffee off the burner and into a thermos or insulated carafe. Just a few minutes sitting there can ruin your efforts.![4 points](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/4points1.cbKq_kD1_E7bTU.webp)_4 Points to great coffee._ Sticking to these four points will make your coffee better: clean equipment, clean water, proper grind, and don’t cook your coffee. Ah, but it’s worth it, isn’t it? Published on January 1, 2002--- #### CB Miller Small coffee roasters are perking up all over the country, recreating styles and blends which were nearly impossible to find just a few years ago. The quality of these blends remains unparalleled by those of the giant coffee companies. However, it is difficult to experience these wonderfully fresh roasted coffees because the roasters are scattered all over the country.

# I Love Coffee [Cafe Culture](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/cafe-culture/)---by [Damaa Bell](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/damaa-bell/)![I Love Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/i-love-coffee/coffee1.jpg) I have been trying to wean myself off of coffee lately. I thought it might be a good time to replace my morning cup ‘o’ joe with a nice healthy cup of tea now that the weather has cooled. The only problem is that I LOVE COFFEE! I love the aroma of fresh brewed coffee, the taste but especially the smell of fresh whole beans. I LOVE COFFEE. I was an early coffee drinker. My family saw nothing wrong with giving a child a cup of java in the morning, rich with chicory, lightened with Pet evaporated milk and thick syrup made from spoonfuls of sugar that settled in the bottom of the cup. C’est bon!![coffee art](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/coffee1.BoRz_IHB_Z13QJMi.webp)_by Mike J. Singletary_ I am sitting here now, sipping a cup of green tea trying to devise a plan to make a detour to Starbucks for some liquid crack. I woke up this morning with what felt like a hangover, only I hadn’t been drinking any alcohol, just water and tea. I think it might have to do with the fact that I haven’t sipped on coffee in any form in over two days. That is typically when the withdrawal symptoms begin – the headaches, the grogginess, and the crankiness. So, like any other addiction one must ride it out or satisfy it. There is no coffee in my apartment – no cans of Maxwell House, no hardened orange packets of instant decaf in my condiments drawer, and no fragrant whole beans ready to be ground and brewed. Maybe going cold turkey isn’t the right way to do this…maybe another cup will help me finally break free of the hold of the sweet, pungent aroma of my old friend. I am truly a coffee connoisseur preferring a steamy cup of fresh ground Kenya coffee. But, when times are hard, a sip or two of any liquid courage will get me through. I’ve had some pretty bad coffee in my day, namely the office coffee that tasted like brown water, burnt urine or a horrible combination of the two. But a good, fresh brewed cup of coffee is like joie de vivre! Despite my best attempts to replace my old friend with a less stimulating, less exciting alternative, once again coffee has won out over the competition. I can’t wait for that first sip to hit my lips. Ummmmm, good to the last drop! Published on April 1, 2006--- #### Damaa Bell Damaa Bell is an emerging writer who resides in Harlem, New York.

# Iced Mint Mocha Recipe [Recipes](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/coffee-recipes/)---by [Lola Low](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/lola-low/)![Iced Mint Mocha Recipe](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/iced-mint-mocha-recipe/choc-iced-mint-mocha1.jpg) So here is something a little different from my wonderful selection of coffee syrup recipes. This is a refreshing beverage, perfect for a hot day or if you fancy something a little different from your average cup of coffee. I discovered this fantastic creation after buying some chocolate mint syrup and delving into my freezer to find some ice cream to complement the syrup nicely. A bit of ice, a blender, and an espresso coffee maker, together with the usual milk and coffee, and the Iced Mint Mocha was born. Here is what you need to make the Iced Mint Mocha: - Plenty of ice - 1 teaspoon of Monin mint chocolate coffee syrup - 2 scoops of mint choc chip ice cream - 1 or 2 espresso shots - Cold milk - Whipped cream - Chocolate dust/sprinkles![iced mint mocha](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/choc-iced-mint-mocha1.FsHTEQT5_1gag6o.webp)_Iced Mint Mocha_ You will also need a blender and, ideally, an espresso maker for this creation. ### Directions 1. Put a handful of ice into a blender 2. Add two scoops of mint choc chip ice cream 3. Add one teaspoon of chocolate mint-flavoured coffee syrup 4. Pour in a preferred amount of cold milk (depending on how thick you want it) and 1-2 shots of espresso (depending on how strong you like it) 5. Blend for one minute 6. Pour into a glass and top with whipped cream and chocolate dust/sprinkles or a drizzle of chocolate mint syrup. The Iced Mint Mocha is now my favourite. The refreshing mint and the sweet chocolate make this iced coffee espresso drink a light combo. This is also good as a sundae-style dessert, just add less milk so the mixture is really thick, and then top with whipped cream, chocolate sprinkles, and a drizzle of chocolate mint syrup. Coffee syrups are available in a variety of flavours including almond, hazelnut, vanilla, and white chocolate. My coffee syrup addiction has continued ever since I started working for a coffee supplier, and I’m not willing to go cold turkey until I have created as many inspiring recipes as possible. Published on November 19, 2014--- #### Lola Low Since joining Cafe Rico, Lola has developed a taste for coffee. Although she used to hate it, she now loves her coffee and is a dab hand at creating innovative recipes, especially with coffee syrups as they are her new addiction.

Brew a pot of your favorite coffee. I like the bold East African coffees such as Ethiopian Harrar, Ethiopian Yirgacheffe, Kenya, Malawi, etc. 2. Brew your favorite tea (yes, you can use your coffee maker for this if you use teabags). We also like to throw in a bag of fruit tea (5 bags of Lipton Tea to 1 bag of Stash Mango Tea, for instance). 3. Combine them at a 50-50 ratio in a plastic or metal pitcher and refrigerate for at least 2 hours. If using a glass pitcher, be VERY cautious as temperature extremes can cause the glass to break or shatter, causing injury and almost assuredly a slow and painful death. 4. Serve over ice. Adding Lemon, Lime, or Orange Juice and Sweetener is optional. Remember, the recipe above is a guideline. Don’t be afraid to experiment with other ingredients like mint, vanilla bean, pureed strawberries, or orange juice. Get Creative, and don’t forget to Share and Enjoy!

# Things I Would Like to See Improved in Specialty Coffee [Coffee Business](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/coffee-business/)---by [Michael Allen Smith](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/michael-allen-smith/)![Things I Would Like to See Improved in Specialty Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/improving-specialty-coffee/improve-specialty-coffee.jpg) Before I go into what I see as the problems with specialty coffee, I will provide some background on myself. In addition to being the publisher of INeedCoffee, I am a huge fan of going to coffee shops. In the last ten years, I have been to several hundred different cafes, mainly in Seattle but also in the San Francisco Bay Area, Portland, Vancouver, and Victoria. I’ve seen the rise of third-wave coffee and loved the journey. In Seattle, I organize a Meetup group that does nothing but explore the coffee scene. We’ve had over 1,000 Meetups in the last 11 years, visiting over 350 coffee venues. In other words, I am a huge fan. Although I do not work directly in the coffee industry, I consider my role as an ambassador both here on INeedCoffee and with the Coffee Club of Seattle. I want to help coffee fans discover more about coffee. As much as the coffee industry has improved in the last decade, I feel there is room for improvement. Here are a few ideas. ### #1 What’s in the Hopper? As an espresso drinker, I think the greatest thing to happen to coffee shops in the last decade has been the rise of “the choice”. Many coffee shops now carry more than one espresso option or do a rotating single-origin espresso. Maybe even both. The offerings could change daily or weekly. The cafe might even be a multi-roaster, where not only does the region of coffee change but so does the roaster. This has changed the way I experience coffee. I’ve become a novelty seeker. I almost never go to places that don’t offer a choice or never change their espresso offerings, and this is a great thing.**The problem is the signage that was prominent just a few years ago is mostly gone or hidden.** I would say half the coffee shops in Seattle that offer more than one espresso have no information on their website, social media, or even at the counter. You have to ask. You have to know to ask. The second espresso has become a big secret. Not in every cafe, but far too many. Coffee shops are doing a much better job detailing their pour-over offerings. The few times I’ve mentioned this, the pushback I’ve received is that the customer doesn’t care. To which I have three responses: 1. I’m a customer, and I care. 2. Why are you offering an espresso choice if the customers don’t care? 3. How should customers care about something they don’t know is available? One cafe in Seattle removed its single-origin espresso offering because no one was ordering it. I pointed out that they never listed their single-origin espresso on their sign or menu, so how was the customer expected to know it was available? They listened to me, and the second espresso offering is now on the menu and being ordered by customers. Recently, I bumped into two friends from the coffee industry at a cafe near where I live. I asked which espresso they tried. They didn’t know there was an option, so they received a mediocre blend instead of a featured single-origin espresso. When it came time to order, they didn’t dig through the pages of menu items to read that they had a choice. It was their first visit. How were they to know? They seemed disappointed in the cafe. I doubt they will be back, which is a shame. There was no problem with the coffee. The problem was communication. I advise cafe owners to walk into their shop as if they know nothing about the coffee being served and see if they can figure out what is in the hopper before the barista asks for their drink order.![Rwanda Single Origin Espresso by Victrola 2012](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/espresso-single-origin-victrola.DuPT28xj_R8PE1.webp)_I took this photo in 2012 at Victrola Coffee in Seattle. Signs like these have become a rarity._  ### #2 No Bus Tray This is a minor issue and easy to remedy. Some coffee shops have begun removing bus trays. They want to be more restaurant-like and offer bus tables for customers. This has good intentions, but unfortunately, it doesn’t work well at the times it most needs to. What happens when a coffee shop experiences a rush? All resources go to making drinks, not busing tables. Customers who are leaving their seats see new customers ready to take their spots. They would like the opportunity to be respectful and clean their area before they leave, but there is no bus tray, and due to the rush, there is no one there to clean the table. So the dirty dishes remain on the table. It makes the person leaving feel like a jerk, and the person sitting down feels like the cafe is a mess. Cafe employees never see this side because that is when they are focused on making drinks. Also, other coffee shops have trained us to place our dishes in a bus tray. We aren’t inconvenienced. We love our coffee shop and want the opportunity to help out, especially when the shop is busy. ### #3 Poor Web and Social Media Skills I could probably write a small book on this topic, so I will keep it brief. Customers primarily want to know three things: 1. Where are you? 2. Are you open? 3. What can I buy? Post your address and hours on your website and social media profiles. Maintain your Google and Yelp listings. Share your holiday schedules and any early closings. And finally, tell us about the coffee. Why should I go to your coffee shop and not another one? Everything else is a bonus. I’ve been told what I listed above is too much work. That is nonsense. Payroll, taxes, permits, and dealing with vendors are work. Sharing an Instagram photo a few times a week with menu information and the store hours on Twitter and Facebook takes seconds. Brewpubs are doing a much better job of showcasing their offerings and communicating with their customers online. ### #4 Mugs Without Handles Specialty coffee shops are now paying attention to every aspect of the coffee experience. Recently, there has been a lot of focus on improving the beverage glassware. One of the hip trends is to serve coffee in mugs without handles. That works fine for milk-based espresso drinks like lattes because they aren’t too hot. However, serving piping hot brewed coffee into a mug without a handle is a dumb idea. Have you ever tried to carry a no-handle mug of hot coffee from the counter to your seat without burning your hand? You grab a fistful of napkins or whatever else you can find to cover that beautiful mug so you don’t injure yourself. And if your customer is focused more on avoiding injury than the craft coffee beverage he just purchased, then that lovely mug failed your mission as a coffee shop to sell a better coffee experience. The end result is that customers will ask for to-go paper cups with sleeves, which increases the cost to the cafe and the environment. Not every mug without handles will have a heat issue, so be sure to test before purchasing a case.![Ritual Coffee Mug - SF](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/ritual-coffee-mug.Dwazoi4P_ZzTCD6.webp)_When Ritual Coffee in San Francisco updated their flagship cafe, they, fortunately, kept the handles on their mugs._### #5 Dressing Like Bums This doesn’t bother me, but I do find it puzzling. The trend in modern coffee shops is to have sleek, beautiful designs. Gone are the days of dark wood, wobbly tables, and old couches. Cozy has been replaced with clean. I’ve been told new cafe buildouts can cost $50,000 to $100,000, possibly more. I’ve seen many cases where the cafe is stunning, the equipment is new, the website and social media images are professional, and the employees dress like they are homeless. If your employees represent the quality image that your cafe is trying to project, why is there no basic dress code? Matching aprons or solid-color shirts are small steps that work. I’ve talked to baristas who stepped up their cafe dress code. Tips went up, morale went up, and customer satisfaction improved, all of which led to an increase in business. Of course, this point is specific to the more modern cafes and not the old-school dark-roasted grunge coffee places born in the 1990s._In 2016,, La Marzocco built an amazing cafe in Seattle. The baristas’ professional dress complimented instead of distracting from the cafe’s beauty._### #6 What is the Price? The trend in specialty coffee has been to remove the big menus with clearly marked prices and instead place the prices on menus near the register or not list the prices at all. I understand the motivation. Big menus with prices are a fast food staple, and quality coffee shops do not see themselves as fast food—and rightfully so. They see themselves more like nice restaurants. The thing is nice restaurants post menus with prices on their website and on their window near the door. They also have menus to preview before you even decide to take a seat. Many coffee shops glossed over that part and the customer often won’t discover the price until they’ve worked their way up to the front of the line.**In an industry that champions price transparency at the farm level, they’ve moved toward price obfuscation at the cafe level.** Another trend is how prices have been removed from many pastry cases. The only way to discover the price is to pay whatever they charge you or hold up the line asking. Some of my fellow coffee explorers have told me they get a condescending response at times when they inquire about a price. My policy is I won’t hold up a line asking about prices. I won’t buy unmarked items. The solution here is to be more like fast food or more like a fine restaurant. Pick one. Hiding your prices until the last second is not a way to build trust with that huge market of coffee drinkers looking to explore higher-end coffee shops.![coffee shop menu 2011](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/burien-press-2011-menu.BpB1RmUh_2bGH4W.webp)_I took this photo in 2011 at The Burien Press. Prices were marked and visible as you walked into the coffee shop. Signs like this in newer coffee shops are becoming rarer. Look for the clipboard on the counter. Please put on your glasses and read the 12-point font and do it quickly because a line is forming behind you._  ### Last Words This post has gotten long enough, so I’ll end it here. Again, I want to repeat that I am a huge fan of specialty coffee shops. I’ve seen tremendous improvement in the last decade, yet in the last few years, I’ve seen that progress stall and even regress. Maybe one or two ideas from this article will be of value to even one coffee shop.

It was a prize to be won and I decided that I would win it whatever it took. There was a cardboard post-box for till slips from purchasers of that brand of coffee. The box had only a couple of slips in and the draw date was left blank. “When the rep comes around next” I was told. I made a plan to achieve my goal. For nearly two months i bought so much packeted coffee that I had to stash it in a box for future use. I dare not say how much I bought! One of the plusses in favout of this strategy was that the competition box was back in the depths of the supermarket, you had to make a plan to take the slip to the box after you had purchased your groceries. Not difficult but enough of a hassle to deter most people who concentrated on the ‘win a scooter or giant tv’ competition by the exit. Creasing the slip in half stopped it lying flat with others.The result was that when it was drawn way over half of the slips were mine. The supermarket rang me on a Monday morning and I was there to collect it at lunchtime, posing for the obligatory photograph for the local newspaper.![Russell Hobbs Espresso Machine](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/rh-espresso-machine1-497x650.CKB1C-p9_bQO5N.webp)_Russell Hobbs Espresso Machine_ It stayed in its box for 2 weeks while I decided how to arrange my kitchen to place it to best advantage.

Well it is an appliance-level device, not a professional’s coffee maker, probably not worth repair unless it goes wrong within the guarantee period. There were signs that maybe this was a reworked warranty return item, probably sold off at bargain rate to the coffee company. Not that I am worried as it was, after all, FREE.![Back of espresso machine](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/rh-back-of-machine.C95tgU-X_Z21nY12.webp)_Back of espresso machine_ It sports a nice attractive stainless steel finish, a one-cup and a two-cup basket, a two-cup group head, an on-off switch, a hot-water / steam switch, power-on and heating-up lights, a steam nozzle, large main control knob, a 1.5l see-thru water tank, and a warming rack on top. The box says “15 bar pressure for rich delicious espresso” and with no gauge we must believe it. In use you let it warm up, put the coffee in the basket, set the controls and turn the main knob to get the coffee going through. After that you can steam the milk, drink the coffee, and clean it up or make more coffee.![Espresso controls](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/rh-controls.B_-BPpqy_T1nFW.webp)_Espresso controls_ Plus features: It is easy, makes a nice coffee with good crema on the top, it makes all the right noises with the water pump, water gurgles, steam hisses, and hot water flushing into the drip tray. Enough to impress a modest guest list. There is a detailed instruction and recipe book with 44 numbered drawings to assist the novice. The warming rack will keep your honey from crystalising too! Cons: the bottom of the plastic tamper is neither quite flat nor large enough. You have to wait a short while for it to heat up to steam temperature after making the coffee. I don’t suppose it will last forever but if you are not running a commercial coffee bar it will suffice until you can buy a better one.![Espresso Shots](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/rh-espresso.BQxJ4jDj_2o0i5m.webp)_Espresso Shots_ Overall summary. I can make a good coffee within the limitations of my beans and grinder. Probably not too expensive to purchase, I believe around R1000 locally. Probably less at Clicks. Take the electric drip to the office and get one!_R1000 (South African Rand) = $141 (US Dollars) in October 2010._ Published on November 1, 2010--- #### Ian Balchin I have owned and ran Fables Bookshop in Grahamstown, South Africa, for 20 years now. I do try to ensure that we have reasonable coffee for the staff and not just the lowest grade of instant on the supermarket shelf, sometimes my efforts are even appreciated! I enjoy some computer programming in Perl which frequently causes excessive coffee consumption to concentrate my efforts. I look forward to improving my home brew by roasting my own beans some time.

# Infant Coffee – 6 Tips for Coffee Drinking Parents [Coffee and Health](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/coffee-health/)---by [Alex Scofield](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/alex-scofield/) Brian had the ultimate show-and-tell story. A classmate of mine in elementary school, Brian only had to push back his sleeve to make others in the class gasp – some in awe, some in terror. On his upper arms were dark marks that looked like liquid stains, which were exactly what they were. Brian had these scars for years, he told us – a relative was holding him when he was a baby and spilled hot coffee all over him. It had been years since I’d thought about Brian and his burn scars, but the memory rushed back soon after my son was born this year. Just as in my school years, I kept imagining a baby smiling one moment, then wailing from the shock and pain of hot coffee spilling on him. It was an inversion of parental horror stories designed to scare kids straight – here was something a child once told me that was now haunting me as an adult. As a heavy coffee drinker – at least three giant mugs a day are the norm – I now realized that I had to be extraordinarily careful about drinking coffee with a baby in the house. And thus a Parent’s Paradox: With the reduced sleep brought on by a new baby, I needed caffeine at a crisis level not experienced since my college years, but the window of opportunity to drink coffee grew smaller and smaller as the baby grew more mobile. ### Minimizing Risk There’s a subgenre of baby-proofing that applies to parents who drink coffee or tea. According to the American Academy of Pediatrics, unintentional home injuries are the leading cause of death in infants 1-year-old or younger, and fires/burns are one of the four top causes of home injuries in children. AAP Safety sheets for parents of babies aged birth to 6 months and [1-2 years](https://www.healthychildren.org/English/ages-stages/toddler/Pages/Safety-for-Your-Child-1-to-2-Years.aspx) describe potential hazards hot beverages can pose for children, along with some tips on reducing the risk of burn.![baby reaching for coffee mug](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/coffee-baby-mug.B4Zo-F5P_2wtjM3.webp)_The coffee mug used in this photo was empty._ Perhaps the granddaddy among rules for parents regarding children and coffee is to NEVER carry a child and any hot food or beverage at the same time. This sounds obvious in theory, but people still do it. “I’m amazed at how many ER burns I see where it turns out a parent was juggling an infant and a cup of coffee at the same time,” said Karen Sheehan, M.D., of Children’s Memorial Hospital in Chicago, in an [article by Hallie Levine Sklar](https://web.archive.org/web/20180118072726/http://www.cnn.com:80/2007/HEALTH/family/11/13/par.baby.safe/index.html) of Parenting.com on at-home baby safety hazards. As babies become more mobile, coffee-drinking parents need to become even more cautious. Think Murphy’s Law from both the baby’s perspective and the coffee mug’s perspective. Is the coffee within reach of a crawling or standing baby? If the coffee is on a table, what if it spills? Is the baby within the _spill range_ if this happens? Is there a tablecloth, or is the coffee set on something else the baby could reach? Even a table can be too low. “Never, ever, ever, EVER leave your cup of coffee on any surface lower than a countertop. Not even for a minute. Or a second. Even if it’s just for a moment, and the baby’s not even in the room. Just DON’T do it,” said Laura Baker, Editor-in-Chief of CliffDweller Magazine in Dallas and author of CliffDweller’s “Mommy, Ph.D.” column. “Put that cup on the top of a bookshelf, or on the refrigerator, or even inside the bathroom cabinet, just don’t put it anywhere low. No matter what, that kid will find it somehow, some way, and spill it everywhere.” Several other sites, including ones for the [Clark Burn Center](https://web.archive.org/web/20170902122738/http://www.upstate.edu/surgery/healthcare/burncenter/checklist.php) at SUNY Upstate Medical University and [KidsHealth.org](https://kidshealth.org/en/parents/safety-burns.html), describe potential hazards coffee can pose for a child, and have related safety tips. ### What Are the Options? It wasn’t long before I realized that my morning coffee routine would be washed away in the sea change my baby’s arrival demanded. A leisurely half-hour gradually downing a giant mug of drip-pot coffee wasn’t going to happen anymore. There was a baby who required breakfast, morning stories, and periodic rescues as he crawled toward “danger spots” in the house. No sense in being cavalier about it. Something had to change, and I suspected there were other coffee-drinking parents who had to make similar choices and sacrifices. Here are six viable alternatives for me and other parents who have room in their hearts to love both their child and their coffee: 1. **Carpe Sipum (‘Seize the Sip’)** – Brew the usual morning coffee, pour a mug, put it in a secure spot that’s out of harm’s way, and steal sips whenever you can. Baby’s breakfast is a golden opportunity – he or she is secure in a high chair, while the parent can set the mug on a nearby counter (way out of baby’s reach, please), and take sips between serving up spoonfuls of organic pureed bananas.  - **Pros:** This option involves the least “rocking the boat” with coffee preferences. You brew up the same amount of coffee, the same type of coffee. Nothing changes except for the rate of consumption.  - **Cons:** Your coffee/caffeine intake is at the mercy of your baby. Many active babies require the near-constant hands-on presence of a parent or guardian. It can take a long time to finish a mug this way — be prepared to develop a taste for room-temperature coffee. While it’s the method I’ve personally used the most, it’s left me pondering other possibilities…2. **Drink from a travel mug** – It’s not just for the car anymore.  - **Pros:** Reduced chances of tragic spills, yet the coffee stays hot longer. As with the above method, you can continue brewing your favorite type of coffee and enjoy it hot.  - **Cons:** A good travel mug reduces the likelihood of a spill, but doesn’t eliminate the possibility – the lids on many travel mugs may pop off if the mug falls.3. **Condense** – For those accustomed to a drip pot, maybe this is the time to switch to espresso. A small cup of espresso can be finished much more quickly than a large mug of coffee, and it cools more quickly than a large mug of coffee.  - **Pros:** There’s no sacrifice in quality – most premium coffee drinks are made with espresso. All the caffeine is packed into a tiny cup, and there’s less potential spillage.  - **Cons:** Brewing espresso requires different equipment from a conventional coffee maker. Most espresso machines cost hundreds of dollars, although there is a stovetop device for making espresso, the [Moka](https://ineedcoffee.com/stovetop-espresso-brewing-tutorial/). The intensity of espresso isn’t for everyone, but for those who need their caffeine badly enough to ponder the options in this article, it’s worth a try.4. **Iced coffee** – Like several of my INeedCoffee colleagues, I will not reheat coffee. If I ever brew more than I can drink, I’ll put the unfinished coffee in a Tupperware container and put it in the refrigerator – there’s always a steady supply of [iced coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/cold-brew-coffee-is-not-rocket-science/) available in my fridge.  - **Pros:** Come morning, this is a low-maintenance way to get one’s caffeine buzz on. There’s no need for anybody to sacrifice their favorite bean this way, and some coffees taste surprisingly good when they’re cold.  - **Cons:** It won’t feel right to many parents. After years of drinking a hot caffeinated beverage each morning, the drink’s temperature alone may have a placebo effect; iced coffee may not cut it as a “wake-up” drink.5. **Take Back the Morning** – Parents can take their coffee as they please for a while if they wake up earlier than their baby. This assumes, of course, that there’s any predictable pattern to the baby’s wake-up time, and that is not always the case.  - **Pros:** It’s rewarding to have some early-morning time that’s exclusively your own. Barring an early awakening from the wee one, you can drink hot coffee at your own pace and be good and caffeinated by the time the baby wakes up.  - **Cons:** Like a New Year’s resolution, this is much easier said than done. It may well require an earlier bedtime the night before, and now we’re talking about some serious time-management issues.6. **Take It On the Road** – Laura Baker of CliffDweller Magazine refers to this one as “The Golden Rule” for coffee-drinking parents. She said: > _Find a drive-thru Starbucks. When things are at their craziest, strap the kid into the car seat, drive through, and have a peaceful cup of coffee. The perfect location is about 15 minutes away, so that you have a nice amount of driving time to drink your steaming hot drink. I would do this at one of two times: when my baby needed to sleep but wouldn’t; she would often fall asleep somewhere during the trip. I also do it now when my daughter is crabby (or I am); she gets a change of scenery and a book in her carseat, kid’s music on the radio, and sometimes a Horizon Organic Vanilla milk (another big bonus of Starbucks–so much better than a cookie, but the kiddies love it. It tastes like a milkshake)._### Conclusion The art of parenting is always a work in progress. I’ve tried some of the above alternatives and merely thought about a couple of the others. So far, what was once a coffee routine has been replaced by an ongoing coffee experiment. I feel certain that there are some other options that haven’t crossed my mind, and I’m interested in hearing from any other parents who may have some tips on this subject – this is certainly not an exhaustive list. E-mail any tips to [\[email protected\]](https://ineedcoffee.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#89e8e5ecf1c9e8e5ecf1faeae6efe0ece5eda7eae6e4) – we’ll post suggestions in a forthcoming article or a revised version of this one.

# INeedCappuccinoWhereverIAm [Cafe Culture](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/cafe-culture/)---by [Shaun McGill](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/shaun-mcgill/)![INeedCappuccinoWhereverIAm](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/ineedcappuccinowhereveriam/caffe-latte-art.jpg) It’s cold today and the windows of my car are iced up – such a shame to waste boiling water on glass. The drive to work is uneventful and dull- no near misses or traffic to distract my mind from the monotonous day ahead. At last, work has arrived and the coffee bar beckons me … “Cappuccino please.” The big silver machine whirs and the milk frother froths as the white paper cup and plastic lid are prepared. Plastic lid? Put that away! They know by now to never put a lid on my coffee- it sticks to the chocolate and eats it up before I get to my drink. “80p please.” Cappuccino is always expensive wherever you go but it seems a small price to pay for my early morning habit.![Cappuccino](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/cappuccino-coffee.FOVJsOST_1nL4HF.webp)_Cappuccino_ 20 minutes later it is gone, the PC screen shines over my desk and the paper cup nestles in my bin. The train journey to London is always fraught with embarrassment. Sneeze and everyone looks at you, read a newspaper and the person next to you leans over with no consideration for your personal space and reads it with you, mobile phone man ‘shouts’ into his phone with no regard for the people around him and so the train chugs along until the big smoke appears with its pollution and faceless people wandering the train station. Meeting over and waiting for the train back to the office. There’s a coffee bar on the station platform and I have 5 minutes before the train arrives. “Cappuccino please.” The big silver machine whirs…………. The impolite man hands over the coffee. “Um, can I not have a lid please?” “Sorry Sir, health and safety- we have to put a lid on it.” “That’s a joke right?” “No sir.” Sigh… “2.60 please.” “You what!?!” I hand over my life savings and sit on the train as it trundles back to the office. The coffee tastes better today and I ponder where the money will come to continue my silly chocolate-covered habit. Home at last- children exhausted and in bed. The Cappuccino maker sits glistening against the evening sun through the kitchen window and beckons me to use it. A few minutes later and it sat there in a familiar mug, no money spent, no person serving it to me. It does not taste half as good because I’m in my comfortable place and it was free. Cappuccino is for coffee bars, sitting outside in the middle of a town, watching the world go by, and for passing the time at work. It should NEVER be drunk in your own house- it is an experience rather than refreshment and deserves an interesting backdrop to its consumption.

# Infrared Roasting [Roasting Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/roasting-coffee/)---by [Angela Kuhns](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/angela-kuhns/)![Infrared Roasting](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/infrared-roasting/coffee-bean-chair-argentina1.jpg) Is infrared roasting superior to conventional roasting? A few coffee companies are saying yes, and now many are enjoying coffee without stomach sensitivity due to their low acid coffee. As most coffee connoisseurs know, the most important part of the coffee process is roasting. During the coffee-roasting process, natural coffee acids form which can lead to heartburn, indigestion, and upset stomach. Reducing these irritants can allow coffee drinkers with sensitive stomachs to enjoy coffee. Standard Commercial roasting puts the beans on a flat-screen conveyor which roasts the beans by blowing flame heated hot air from below. Another method is to place the beans in a tumbler and then blow the flame heated, hot air through as they tumble. Both methods, however, have a tendency to allow the flame to burn the beans and not cook them evenly and all the way through. Also, acidic compounds are still present in the beans, and at a much higher content.![Coffee Bean Chair ](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/coffee-bean-chair-argentina1.DSDQgt5p_Z1erCqN.webp)_Coffee Bean Chair – Buenos Aires, Argentina_ However, a few companies are now using infrared roasting to bring out the desired flavor and aroma. In the process, they discovered that the best coffee is custom-roasted in small batches to guarantee smooth, controlled flavor. Commercial coffees are usually hot air-roasted with unevenly cooked “acidic” beans. Only an exclusive 2% of coffee beans are specialty roasted using Infrared technology. This type of roasting leads to lower acidity levels and an evenly roasted bean, and it completely eliminates a burnt or bitter coffee taste. By specialty roasting, the beans increase in temperature quicker than those roasted by hot air. Studies have shown that compared to conventional roasting, infrared roasting showed less increase in radicals on the bean during and after the roasting process. Highly noticeable was the consistent formation of brown-colored compounds, which showed that the bean was uniformly heated and never burned. The infrared roasted beans had a quick increase in the internal temperature and thus suffered less damage on the surface. The study also revealed a uniform and quick decrease in moisture and showed the beans undergo uniform heating even at the core. Hence, a perfectly roasted, never burned, and very delicious coffee bean that is always available to the consumer with no variation in the taste from bag to bag. Even more note worth was the changes in the contents of citric acid, malic acid, and formic acid that are naturally found in the bean. When monitored and compared to conventional roasting, infrared roasted coffee beans showed changes from an earlier stage. As the roasting proceeded, the infrared roasted coffee beans contained these acids in a smaller amount! Not surprisingly, the content of aroma compounds was found to be 25% more than that of conventional roasting, and when tested was found to carry the same standard to the cup. The taste from the extract of hot air roasted coffee beans was similar to most conventional roastings, while the extract of the infrared roasted coffee beans was different from theirs (i.e., weaker acidity) leading to a better coffee without a bitter taste. The conclusion of the study was this… “From the viewpoint of taste, the extract of the infrared roasted coffee beans is distinguishable from the existing [convention roasting], since it is rich in aroma components and shows a ‘light’ acidity.” ### Sources [asic-cafe.org](https://www.asic-cafe.org/), 2008 Angelascoffeeshop.com, 2008 Published on February 1, 2009--- #### Angela Kuhns

# Intelligentsia iPhone App Review [Coffee Business](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/coffee-business/)---by [Chris Arnold](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/chris-arnold/) If you haven’t heard of Intelligentsia Coffee Roasters out of Chicago, you probably aren’t a Coffee Geek. Many Coffee Geeks may have even broken in their first real espresso machine on the famous Intelligentsia Black Cat Espresso blend. Starting in 1997, they offer a very compelling look at espresso, roasting, coffee, and the people who grow them. And now they have thrown their hat into the iPhone app ring. But it is more than just an app about their company, a way to order their coffee or a glorified advertisement. It actually provides useful instruction. You know, on the stuff that actually matters, like making coffee. There are detailed, step-by-step directions with nice illustrations on a variety of coffee methods. Of course, they also provide information on their coffee offerings and a brew timer, as well as more detailed information about the company, its products, and its philosophies.![iphone-intelligentsia](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/iphone-intelligentsia1.CrGRt-u2_ZyDPOe.webp) There are four main pages accessed from icons along the bottom: - Coffee – Their Current Offerings - Brewing – Detailed, Illustrated, Step-by-Step Brewing - Brew Timer – A Brew Timer - About – About the Company, Projects, and Philosophy ### Quirks The Intelligentsia iPhone app has a few oddities, so let’s get those out of the way first. On the Coffee Page, there is a little “Forward” or “Share” icon in the upper right-hand corner. Only that’s not what it’s for. Instead, it is a way to filter the coffees you are looking for by all sorts of criteria. I like the feature, but I think they should just use a different icon. That’s just me. On the Brewing instruction pages, some of them cut off the text at the bottom, but just a little. It just looks weird. I think they could either shrink the text, shrink the illustration, or both, and it would look less beta and more pro. They provide no tips for espresso preparation. Granted, there isn’t a lot they can tell you about how to prepare espresso with your particular machine, but a temp recommendation would be nice. They could put this on the specific Coffee page itself or make a new category on the Brewing Page and only list their espresso blends there, along with the temps. After all, some people can adjust their espresso machine temps to a very precise window and would love to know how Intelligentsia rolls when it comes to the temps on a specific blend or single-origin bean (SO espresso). Lastly, there doesn’t seem to be any way to purchase coffee within the app. Look, folks, impulse buys on devices like the iPhone are massive. I buy way too much stuff from Amazon or even the Apple App Store just because it is easy. I order Chipotle over Rubios because there is an app that makes it easy. Give us a way to click a couple of buttons and buy your coffee!!! ### Different Philosophy On the bright side, the app is beautiful, with wood-grain backgrounds, nice fonts, an intuitive UI, and a wealth of actual information that matters to us Coffee Lovers. You can find out if a coffee is “In Season”, “Direct Trade”, or part of a “Black Cat Project”. You probably won’t see terms like Fair Trade, Organic, Shade Grown, or Bird Friendly. Here is why: They actually try to follow something they call “Direct Trade”. What does that mean? Here is how they explain it: > _“Coffee quality must be exceptional.”_> _“The grower must be committed to healthy environmental practices.”_> _“The verifiable price to the grower or the local coop, not simply the exporter, must be at least 25% above the Fair Trade price.”_> _“The grower must be committed to sustainable social practices.”_> _“All the trade participants must be open to transparent disclosure of financial deliveries back to the individual farmers.”_> _“Intelligentsia representatives must visit the farm or cooperative village at least once per harvest season, understanding that we will most often visit three times per year: pre-harvest to craft strategy, during the harvest to monitor quality, and post-harvest to review and celebrate the successes.”_ So it’s actually better than Fair Trade coffee. Pretty high standards. The more I read, the more I love these guys’ attitudes. ### Details Now, let’s look at each page one by one: ### Coffee After selecting a specific Coffee Offering, there are 3 pages that are accessed by swiping left and right: 1. Description of the coffee, and any tags for “In Season”, “Direct Trade”, or a “Black Cat Project”. 2. Detailed specs about the coffee, including the farmer’s name (very cool!), Farm, Region, Varietal, Harvest, and Country 3. A way to share, or view the Story, Images, Videos, Comments, or even Comment yourself![iphone-single-origin](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/iphone-single-origin.-Mw8bG_r_Z2ojb5u.webp) ![finca-story-iphone](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/finca-story-iphone.D6BFl4rR_1Dvnfl.webp)![finca-story-iphone](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/finca-story-iphone.D6BFl4rR_1Dvnfl.webp)![finca-colombia](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/finca-colombia.XPZJTxa4_ZXFp9K.webp) ### Brewing After selecting a brew method, you select one of 6 Brewing Methods which are accessed by tapping. They are: 1. Cafe Solo 2. Pourover 3. Chemex 4. Cupping 5. Siphon Brewer 6. French Press Once a brewing method is selected, you are presented with the first page, which shows a nice illustration of the representative brewing vessel, along with a very general description of how the coffee should taste once brewed with this method. However, I find their descriptions more fluff than reality. As an example, for the French Press, it says in part, “…it gives a sweet, lush and satisfying brew.” Ummmm. OK. Not exactly how I would describe the French Press, but it’s not my app. And I am no genius marketeer either, so maybe they should leave it. Swiping to the left presents page two, which tells you what you are going to need to make said coffee. For example, this is what it lists for French Press: - 34g of whole bean coffee - Cold Filtered Water - 4 Cup French Press - Electric Kettle - Burr Grinder set to coarse - Digital Scale - Vessel to decant into - Soup Spoon - Your favorite mug Swiping to all the additional pages, which can exceed a dozen depending on the method, show individual detailed steps with illustrations, and even illustrated cleanup instructions. Very nice touch.![brewing-3-methods-iphone](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/brewing-3-methods-iphone.CikNI0sj_zja0D.webp) ![french-press-iphone](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/french-press-iphone.DgVSKr2r_R4PTL.webp)![french-press-iphone-2](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/french-press-iphone-2.D9gAvepZ_1mLWBF.webp) ![french-press-iphone-3](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/french-press-iphone-3.CioM54JU_Z2DT9W.webp) ### Timer Not much to be said here. Choose one of the 6 main brewing methods, and hit start. It would be nice to include a timer for espresso, as well as to customize the times for the advanced users. For instance, they set the French Press timer to 4 minutes, but what if I like 3:30 or 3 minutes flat? Just an idea for improvement.![iphone-brew-timer](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/iphone-brew-timer.CrzuBl-f_Tvmww.webp) ![iphone-brew-times-by-method](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/iphone-brew-times-by-method.DKsUiWEm_cKH2O.webp) ### About There are six cute little graphics, that when touched slide down a quick blurb. You can tap again to be taken to a full-page view to read more. Here are the items you can select from: 1. About Intelligentsia – Tells you about, guess who? 2. Direct Trade – Explains what “Direct Trade” means. A good read. 3. In Season – Explains what “In Season” means. Another good read. 4. Black Cat Project – Explains what the “Black Cat Project” is all about. Yet again, a good read. How do they keep doing that? 5. Locations – Links to the Intelligentsia locations, with address, phone number, hours, and a nice simple map view, with a link to Google Maps. 6. Twitter – Direct view of their Twitter Feed.![about-iphone-app1](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/about-iphone-app1.B-_r9G35_x6R63.webp)![about-iphone-app2](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/about-iphone-app2.NrddP0sC_SnhV1.webp) ### Conclusion The app is very polished, has a few quirks, extremely useful, but best of all is FREE!!! I can see myself referring to this for the more exotic preparations (like Siphon), but really more as a recommendation to friends who want to get into coffee, and happen to have an iPhone. It will really save a lot of explaining. Put that Cappuccino down, and grab your copy today. Published on December 22, 2010--- #### Chris Arnold Chris is the creator of Two Bit History.

# Interesting Facts About Kombucha You May Not Know Yet [Tea](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/tea/)---by [Jared Gustafson](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/jared-gustafson/)![Interesting Facts About Kombucha You May Not Know Yet](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/interesting-facts-about-kombucha-you-may-not-know-yet/Kombucha-header.jpg) You may have already heard by now about kombucha tea, the healthy drink that has seen a boost in popularity in the past few years and can be found bottled or on tap in grocery stores, cafes, saloons, or even in your own home. If you are not yet familiar with it then let me introduce it to you. Kombucha is a drink made from tea (black or green), yeast, and sugar. The ingredients are mixed together and are set aside for at least a week. During this time the mix ferments and bacteria, acids, and a small amount of alcohol form. The bacteria and acids form a film over the liquid called a SCOBY (symbiotic colony of bacteria and yeast). This can be used to ferment more kombucha. To end the fermentation process, the SCOBY is removed. It can be stored for future use to ferment more kombucha. There is so much to say about this popular drink and much that has been said. There are many claims on the internet about its health benefits, but not all of them are backed by scientific studies. In this article, you will find various interesting facts about kombucha, its origins, and its benefits, backed by its discovered health benefits.![serve 4 glasses of kombucha](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/kombucha-4-types.DOC6EoJV_6bWwh.webp) ### Origins and History of Kombucha The origins of Kombucha are uncertain. A German author named Frank Günther has conducted the most extensive research on kombucha and explains that although stories most often couple kombucha with East Asian cultures, most reports or allegations are simply anecdotal. As such, the true origins of kombucha remain a mystery to this day. The oldest origin story for kombucha dates back all the way to 414 BCE in Japan. It is said that a Korean doctor named Kombu brought the tea to Japan to aid Emperor Inkyo. This is also from where it is thought that the name initially originated. The first mention of kombucha in the West is in the early 20th century in Russia, where it appeared as a result of the expansion of trade routes. ### Science-Backed Health Benefits of Kombucha A study on different types of kombucha proved some of its beneficial properties, such as: - Anti-bacterial effects - Antioxidant properties - Anti-diabetic properties - Cholesterol reduction - Offers support to the immune system - Stimulates the detoxification of the liver Kombucha tea also contains various minerals, vitamins, and amino acids derived mainly from the tea used in its preparation. It contains: - Potassium - Manganese - Fluoride - Vitamins E, K, B - Theanine amino acid Also, during the fermentation process, various other chemical compounds form that have health benefits for the organism. The time of fermentation and the type of tea influence the anti-radical properties of kombucha. It has been found that kombucha prepared from green tea is characterized by the highest antioxidant potential, reaching the highest value on the first day of fermentation. In the case of every type of kombucha, the amount of health-supporting compounds decreased with the increase in the time of fermentation. ### Kombucha Can Be a Healthier Alternative to Beer Both kombucha and beer come to life through a fermentation process so, in this sense, we can say that they are related. We can consider kombucha as a cousin of beer. Commercial kombucha that can be found in grocery stores is labeled as non-alcoholic as it contains less than 0.5% alcohol. However, home-brewed kombucha can have alcohol concentrations of up to 3.5 to 4 %. It may not be enough to give you the buzz that a few beers do, but it is a perfect, healthier, refreshing replacement for beer on a hot, sunny day.![4 glasses of kombucha](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/kombucha-3.DuuB3c7I_ZrVUAr.webp) ### Kombucha Can be Used in Clothes Making Perhaps the most interesting fact about kombucha is that it can be made into clothes. It may seem hard to believe, but it’s true. Dried kombucha culture forms a textile called microbial cellulose that resembles leather and is 100% biodegradable. This material can be used to make clothing items such as: - Jackets - Shirts - Shoes - Handbags ### Kombucha, the Mysterious, Delicious, Healthy Drink on the Rise In the past few years, people have shown increased interest in this amazing drink and for good reasons, it is a truly refreshing drink with various health benefits and due to its low caloric index, you can enjoy it as much as you’d like without having to worry about putting on any extra weight. ### Resources [Chemical Profile and Antioxidant Activity of the Kombucha Beverage Derived from White, Green, Black and Red Tea](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7278673/) – May 2020 study on kombucha.

# Is It Really Coffee? Inside the Coffee Vending Machine [Coffee Business](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/coffee-business/)---by [Holland Morgan](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/holland-morgan/)![Is It Really Coffee? Inside the Coffee Vending Machine](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/is-it-really-coffee/inside-coffee-vending-machine.jpg) We see them everywhere now. Instant cappuccino machines, there’s at least one (if not five) in every gas station. I’ve seen them in car dealerships and even in a hardware store, some of them daring to sport names like Barista. With just the touch of a button, we can have our choice of vanilla cappuccino, orange mocha, or even caramel apple latte. A terrific bargain at just $2 for 24 ounces. It sounds too good to be true. But is it really coffee? Technically it is coffee but you can judge for yourself. When one of these machines is opened up for its nightly cleaning (yes they are well maintained) one can observe that there are no coffee grounds to be seen. Instead, there is a dry container, called a hopper, which dispenses instant coffee powder into a funnel where it is mixed with hot water. The coffee mix is frothed on its way out of the funnel and into your cup. Ingenious really. It’s sanitary and cost-effective, but I remain skeptical of the instant coffee powder. It reminds me of a certain store brand of instant cappuccino powder. I’m not talking about Folgers crystals here; I’m talking about the frou-frou all-in-one mixes. For some reason, these products conjure up images of bubble baths, romance novels, and the Delilah radio show. Don’t ask me why.![Coffee Vending Machine](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/coffee-vending-machine1.HUee5yd4_Zx5yxS.webp)_Coffee Vending Machine_ Here are the ingredients of one of the commercial mixes:**Ingredients:** Sugar, Nondairy Creamer (Corn Syrup Solids, Partially Hydrogenated Soybean Oil, Sodium Caseinate, Dipotassium Phosphate, Mono and Diglycerides, Artificial Color, Silicon Dioxide, Lecithin, Artificial Flavor), Whey Powder, Nonfat Dry Milk, Instant Coffee, Cocoa (Processed with Alkali), Salt, Guar Gum, Natural and Artificial Flavors, Calcium Silicate (to prevent caking) Coffee is #5 on the list if you don’t count the ingredient sub-list for nondairy creamer. Most of the spurious ingredients are found in non-dairy creamer. Have you ever wondered what guar gum is for? I have. - **Corn Syrup Solids:** Dried corn syrup, used in imitation dairy as a whitener. - **Partially Hydrogenated Soybean Oil:** Hydrogenated=trans-fats, need I say more? - **Sodium Caseinate:** Emulsifier and stabilizer derived from milk proteins. So much for non-dairy. - **Dipotassium Phosphate:** Flavor enhancer. Also an ingredient in certain pesticides, but then again many pesticides contain water. - **Mono and Diglycerides:** Emulsifiers. Help with that creamy consistency. - **Silicon Dioxide:** Anti-caking agent, also known as sand. That’s right, sand. - **Lecithin:** Emulsifier and preservative naturally found in eggs and found to reduce cholesterol. - **Guar Gum Thickener:** Guar gum is far more potent than cornstarch. Sometimes used as a laxative. - **Calcium Silicate:** Anti-caking agent. More fancy sand.![Inside Coffee Vending Machine](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/inside-coffee-vending-machine.CWvbTbMt_2aSXAQ.webp)_Inside Coffee Vending Machine_ If you regularly eat Twinkies or other such “foods”, you are already accustomed to these ingredients because their ingredients are shockingly similar. Twinkies have over thirty ingredients. Instant cappuccinos have eighteen. Fifteen of the ingredients in these instant coffees are also in Twinkies. Many of them are slight variations but are essentially the same. The remaining three not found in Twinkies are coffee, cocoa, and the sand.

# Is the iCoffee Brewer Better than French Press? [Brewing Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/brewing-coffee/)---by [Michael Allen Smith](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/michael-allen-smith/)![Is the iCoffee Brewer Better than French Press?](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/is-the-icoffee-brewer-better-than-french-press/iCoffee-French-Press.jpg) For many years, I started every morning with French press coffee. I loved the ritual of getting up early, heating the water, grinding the coffee, pouring in the hot water, waiting 3-4 minutes, plunging, and then serving. But I’m also a morning person. Some coffee drinkers don’t have the energy or patience to make a French Press in the morning, so they often opt for an automatic drip coffee maker. The problem is that as great as a drip coffee maker is for ease, it lacks the richness of the French Press. In recent years, a few companies have tried to develop ways to improve the automated drip machine. One of those companies is Remington. They developed a new drip machine called the _iCoffee_. Their design uses what they call “rotational steam brewing”. Instead of the water coming at the beans from the top, they use a gold filter, circulating the water towards the ground coffee from the side. I don’t have much experience with drip coffee makers, but I found that iCoffee makes a cup of coffee close to the French Press. I still prefer the slightly smoother taste of the French press, but if I were a person who wanted the convenience of drip, it would do a fine job.![iCoffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/icoffee-clean1.CViEQMft_Z1xamSU.webp)_Running water through the machine before the first brew._![iCoffee open](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/icoffee-open.OBQqvIhA_1KNsEs.webp)_This is the inside top of the iCoffee._### iCoffee Tips The documentation does not specify a recommended grind size. We found that using a regular drip grind was too fine and tasted bitter. Go a little coarser—not quite French Press coarse, though. Look at the [Coffee Grind Chart](https://ineedcoffee.com/coffee-grind-chart/) and try to get your grind between Medium and Coarse. The _iCoffee_ website states that you can save money by using 15% less coffee. The claim was skeptical, but our tests showed that a 19 to 1 ratio (grams of water to grams of coffee) tasted just as good as the standard 17 to 1 ratio. This might change with different coffees, different roast levels, and, of course, personal tastes.![iCoffee brewer](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/icoffee.NroRV2SB_Z1yJVXa.webp)_The iCoffee has a window to observe the brewing._![iCoffee temperature](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/icoffee-temp.CvRZ2a_b_22c5Mn.webp)_The iCoffee coffee temperature at the end of a full pot was 180 F._### Messy Cleanup The _iCoffee_ isn’t the easiest brewing method for cleaning up. Because of the steam, the inside can get messy. Cleaning in there is not as easy and straightforward as rinsing the French press. One risk you could potentially have with the _iCoffee_ is mold could form and grow if you don’t do a good enough job cleaning it. Meanwhile, most French Press brewers are dishwasher safe. ### Other Options For a more detailed write-up of the _iCoffee_, check the favorable review by _KitchenBoy_ in the resources below. _KitchenBoy_ prefers iCoffee over French Press, whereas I give the edge to the French Press. _KitchenBoy_ uses a 4-6 minute French press steep, which he states produces bitterness. I advise using a 3-4 minute steep with a slow 30-second plunge. I found this results in less bitterness. When we first reviewed the _iCoffee_ brewer in 2014, the price was $120 USD. Too much, in my opinion. Since then, the price has been cut in half to $60 USD. That is a fair price. I recommended this brewer as a good alternative to those who love French Press but want the convenience of a drip machine The downside of the iCoffee is the effort required to clean the brewer properly. I still prefer the classic French Press even with the new lower price. But it is a close call.![iCoffee vs French Press](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/icoffee-vs-french-press.C_nwkKZ7_Z1nvEPb.webp)_Comparing the iCoffee head to head with a French Press._![iCoffee on/off](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/on-off.CioCO_xj_ZjX4Yk.webp)_The user interface for the iCoffee brewer._### Resources  [Buying a French Press – Picking the Right One](https://ineedcoffee.com/buying-a-french-press-picking-the-right-one/) – Our French Press purchasing guide.

# It’s All About Taste [Coffee Business](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/coffee-business/)---by [Alex Fisenko](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/alex-fisenko/) ### When It’s Right, It Sells As patrons enter a food court in the student union building of a large midwestern university, the aroma of fresh, grinding espresso coffee beans entices them to the coffee kiosk, featuring espresso-based drinks and freshly baked muffins. Many of these kiosks serve over a thousand espresso-based drinks a day, generate much-needed morning traffic and create a strong and loyal customer base that returns for their lattes several times a week! ### When It’s Bad, It Stinks Unfortunately, many other existing institutional food operators have found the addition of espresso stations disappointing. Worse yet, these drinks only become palatable when their bitter taste is disguised by adding flavored syrups. A short time ago I was called by a supermarket chain that implemented a dual bagel/espresso concept. They were unhappy with the slow pace of the espresso sales and wanted me to analyze their operation. After watching the barista prepare me a latte and tasting it, I knew right away what one of the main problems was: the product had no resemblance to what a properly prepared latte should taste like. To make a fair comparison, it would be like serving a stale, hard, half-baked bagel or muffin to a customer, charging for it $5.00, expecting them to like it, and coming back for more. The espresso beans were excellent, supplied by one of the biggest coffee roasters, and the barista followed the preparation guidelines provided by the supplier. I proceeded to make several lattes, using the same coffee and milk. Everybody, including the customers, agreed that this was the best latte that they ever had! The main comment was: “What did you do, change the coffee?”![caffe latte art](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/caffe-latte-art1.DbyjiL1A_Z10upK.webp)_Caffe Latte Art_ Many so-called baristas working in those establishments are espresso challenged and really don’t know what a good latte should taste like, or how to prepare it properly. The astonishing fact is, that in many cases, neither the barista, nor his/her supervisor or even the owner or the president of the business has ever tasted a well-prepared espresso-based drink, and therefore they have no standard of comparison. And because they do not like what they taste, they are not sold on its potential to build traffic into the store and generate new customers. This also hurts the coffee supplier, as the customer tends to blame the coffee if he or she does not like the taste of the drink. What is the use of developing and roasting the best coffee in the world and paying a premium price for coffee beans, if the espresso beverage becomes unpalatable during the preparation stage at the retail level? Learn the difference between properly prepared espresso-based drinks and the mediocre product that is unfortunately served in the majority of establishments like bagel shops, ice cream stores, bakeries, delis, contract-managed food companies, and supermarket food courts. Oh, and don’t let me forget the so-called gourmet coffee stores in most of the malls across the country. Though customer tastes may be subjective, they will know the difference right away. A supervisor or an owner would hit the ceiling if they found their employees serving hard, stale and under-baked bagels or muffins. But they never raise an eyebrow when the equivalent is done to the espresso-based drinks. Why should they? They don’t know the difference, as they never had the real thing themselves.**Get your baristas to understand the difference between mediocre espresso and the real thing.** I’ve operated sixteen stores myself and trained probably 1000 people in the last twenty-five years. I am well aware of proper employee training challenges. But it takes the same length of time to train someone the right way as it does to train the same person the wrong way. In most cases, is that the barista follows the training procedure given to him/her by the supervisor, the coffee distributor, or the equipment salesperson. **Therefore, as an owner, you must learn how to be an expert barista yourself.** Then, teach your baristas the proper preparation techniques. Also, insist that your espresso delivery person checks on the baristas every time the delivery person is in the store. Once the baristas learn how to make excellent espresso drinks, they will develop a taste for the real thing and won’t serve anything that they would not drink themselves. And a final word of advice: **If you won’t do it right, please don’t add espresso to your food establishment.** You will turn off the already espresso-educated customers, fail to gain increased traffic, waste your counter space and investment, and upset your employees. Most of all, you will miss the opportunity of creating a true impact on your concept by developing an effective espresso profit center that would attract new customers and increase your revenues.

# Javatrekking: Global Coffee Connections [Coffee Business](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/coffee-business/)---by [Alex Scofield](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/alex-scofield/)![Javatrekking: Global Coffee Connections](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/javatrekking-global-coffee-connections/javatrekker-book1.jpg) > _When you sit back with a good cup of coffee you are engulfed in the aroma, the taste, the acidity, and body of the brew. You take in all the dimensions of the cup – yet this is only the surface. Swirling beneath are worlds within worlds of culture, custom, ecology, and politics. All of the major issues of the twenty-first century – globalization, immigration, women’s rights, pollution, indigenous rights, and self-determination – are being played out through this cup of coffee in villages and remote areas around the world._ – Dean Cycon Dean Cycon takes pride in the fact that he is an exception to the disconnected world of coffee. Many coffee growers have never tasted a sip of their own coffee, and few coffee retailers or drinkers have been anywhere near where their beans are grown. “The truth is, 99 percent of the people involved in coffee commerce, from roasters to baristas, have never been to a coffee village,” says Cycon in his book _Javatrekker: Dispatches From the World of Fair Trade Coffee_ (Chelsea Green Publishing Co., 2007). If the book’s title evokes a “Star Trek” association, it’s probably not coincidental – Cycon aims to go where no coffee roaster has gone before.![javatrekker book](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/javatrekker-book1.B7rittVs_Z1PucGl.webp)_Javatrekker: Dispatches From the World of Fair Trade Coffee_ Twentysomethings and thirtysomethings who feel lost about their direction in life may find Cycon inspiring. He didn’t discover his life’s mission until he was 40 years old when he founded _Dean’s Beans_, a coffee roaster based in Orange, Mass. When Cycon delivered the Hampshire College commencement speech in Amherst, Mass. earlier this year, he described his ambition to start a coffee company that took responsibility for the chronic underdevelopment in coffee-growing communities. Cycon told Hampshire’s graduates that the Dean’s Beans business model “is not fancy and does not require a Ph.D.” The company’s bottom line is secondary to a process that provides development assistance to the indigenous people who grow the coffee. Cycon travels around the world to meet the growers and discuss their goals and needs. Dean’s Beans then helps the farmers finance their projects by paying “a meaningful price” for the beans, at or above Fair Trade value; and profit-sharing. Essentially, it’s a for-profit business with a mission similar to many nonprofits. Cycon’s business brings him face-to-face with coffee growers worldwide, and _Javatrekker_ is a narrative of his travels to the coffee farms in developing countries where Dean’s Beans are grown. The countries he visits – among them Ethiopia, Nicaragua, Peru, Indonesia, Colombia, El Salvador, and Guatemala – read like a list of crisis nations from the past three decades or so. While overall conditions have improved in some of these countries, their coffee farmers often face massive obstacles to earning a living. The beans, in turn, face myriad obstacles to reaching your cup. Cycon has seen thousands of human faces behind the world’s coffee industry. None of them is Juan Valdez. ### Bear Market Backdrop Most of Cycon’s “Javatrekker” travels take place in the 21st century, with the backdrop of a global crash in coffee prices. As profitable as the new millennium has been for coffee retailers, it has been brutal to the farmers. When coffee trades at less than 60 cents per pound – as it did from 2000 until 2004 – it costs more to grow and harvest the beans than it pays to sell them. Growers slide into debt. “At the same time, coffee companies throughout the United States were making the grossest of gross profits,” Cycon says. “They could buy the beans for so little, without dropping their prices to customers who were so unaware of the economics and true human cost of the trade.” There’s nothing unusual about a pound of roasted premium coffee retailing for $12 or more in the United States. Farmers who receive [Fair Trade](https://ineedcoffee.com/fair-trade-coffee-klatching/) prices for organic Arabica beans will get $1.34 to $1.36. Most receive far less than the Fair Trade amount, even if they’re eligible. The difference goes to a chain of “coyote” transporters, money lenders, exporters, importers, roasters, and retailers – sometimes cooperatives or governments take a cut too. Cutting out the middleman? It’s far easier said than done in most coffee-growing countries. As Cycon meets the world’s coffee farmers, he sees what they’re up against. In Tapachula, Mexico, Cycon visits a shelter for people who lost arms or legs trying to ride the “Death Train,” a freight train that runs north through Mexico and into the United States. The stench of the tiny shelter and the apparent hopelessness of its 26 residents haunt Cycon after he leaves. His despair in Tapachula could apply to many of the other places he visits. > _“This whole thing seemed a horrifying dead end. What was at all possible to do here besides make a donation and run screaming home? The despair was really sinking in. … I sat stoically, but my Great White Hope veneer was cracking.”_ But donating once and fleeing the scene runs counter to Cycon’s ideals. He’s disgusted by corporate, single-shot, photo-op donations that do nothing to change the coffee farmer’s longer-term plight. He wants to see the world’s coffee growers make a sustained living through their trade. Cycon returns to the Tapachula shelter and asks its residents to dream about what they’d do if they could leave and get a new start. They brainstorm on ways to make these dreams a reality. One man wants to return to growing coffee in Honduras; a woman wants to run a store in her Salvadoran hometown. “I’d make love to some Chinese girls,” says another man in the shelter. It’s this fusion of hope and humor that keeps _Javatrekker_ very readable, even amidst scenes of poverty, war, and injustice. There are more jokes than sermons in this book. Side stories are refreshing and relevant, like when Cycon delves into the rivaling claims between Yemen and Ethiopia as the birthplace of coffee. Cycon remains flexible in his approaches to each coffee-growing community. Their needs vary. As the head of a business, Cycon doesn’t need to adhere to the whims of donors, as he might if he ran a nonprofit. In Colombia, Cycon wonders why coffee grown by indigenous Arhuaco farmers is producing samples of such uneven quality. > _“That’s it!” I shouted. “That’s why the samples were so different. The coffee we got last year probably came from different farmers than the ones who grew the samples this year.” I explained that it was really important for them to segregate coffee by altitude and region if they wanted to have a distinct coffee in the marketplace. That way a buyer could be guaranteed a similar taste and quality profile each year, instead of the luck of the draw that happened when everything was mixed together. That is what differentiates specialty coffee from whatever comes out of a supermarket can.”_ It is the breakthrough moment that many people hope for when they’re working in the developing world. The Arhuaco farmers are already skilled at growing quality coffee; it’s the game of the global marketplace they now need to master. Despite the way the international coffee market has treated them, Cycon remains hopeful that a new business paradigm can help coffee farmers in Colombia and elsewhere can improve their lives. ### Java Don’t Preach Cycon’s tone in _Javatrekker_ is rarely preachy or shaming. There’s no need for it – his travels speak for themselves. That doesn’t mean that he fails to get his shots at the corporate coffee industry, which he views as exploitative and detached from its impact on coffee growers. His disgust at progressive poses by corporations comes through loud and clear. The same goes for Cycon’s opinions on many of this century’s most pressing global issues. They are personified by coffee growers throughout the world: - **Global Warming** – Javier Mestres, an indigenous Arhuaco coffee farmer in Colombia’s Sierra Nevada mountains knows about global warming without the benefit of Al Gore movies. His family’s coffee plants are flowering prematurely, and the berries are weakening. - **Illegal Immigration** – Wilmer, a coffee farmer from Honduras, has lost both of his legs, each amputated just above the knee. He lives within Dona Olga’s Tapachula, Mexico shelter for 26 economic refugees who were maimed while trying to hop the “Death Train” to the U.S. Wilmer tells Cycon he dreams of returning to Honduras to resume coffee farming. - **War on Drugs** – Javier Mestres in Colombia says aerial coca eradication programs are ruining coffee crops and polluting water supplies. Some Colombian organic farms lose their certification because aerial sprays drift onto coffee plants, Cycon says. - **Women’s Rights** – Esperanza is the first female agronomist in Peru’s coffee region, and she works with a coffee co-op through times of revolution and terrorism in Peru. An all-male board of directors asks her to manage the co-op in 1993. She travels to the 2003 Specialty Coffee Association of America convention in Boston, clinging to the faint hope that her co-op can make a major sale. ### Conclusion Roaming through a Sumatran coffee forest, Cycon ponders his Javatrekking life of the last 15 years. “I think about the blessings in my life that have flowed from this venture,” he says. “I have been able to travel, meet interesting people, and experience different cultures. I get to help people work toward their goals. And to top it all off, it actually pays the bills.” It’s this attitude that makes _Javatrekker_ such a good read. The book could be a 239-page guilt trip, but it’s not. It’s interesting, often funny, consistently eye-opening, and persuasive advocacy of Fair Trade coffee. Cycon keeps the focus on the people who grow coffee, so the narrative never bogs down to dry economics or despair. The coffee growers, for all they’ve endured, are determined to make it, and Cycon shares their determination.

# Java’s First Time Alone [Cafe Culture](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/cafe-culture/)---by [Rena Rogers](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/rena-rogers/)![Java’s First Time Alone](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/javas-first-time-alone/cup-of-coffee1.jpg) So I thought the day began with me. Could I have been wrong? I glanced to the corner of the room. Where Mr. Coffee is, or should have been. “Mr. Coffee! Answer me, where are you?” I yelled. Why isn’t he answering, why can’t I see him? I’ll just quietly wait for her to show. It seems like forever. The door opens, but wait. It is not her. The lights come on, one by one. It was like watching a ball field light up. “Where am I? Why won’t anyone answer me?” Looking around some more, I notice this guy. He walks up to this huge machine on the counter near me and pushes some button.![cup of coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/cup-of-coffee1.ZoPccYo7_1z9ERp.webp) “Hey!” I begin to say but before I can get it out, I hear something or someone hiss. “Shhh. They’ll hear you!” “Who is that?” “It’s me, Mr. Bunn.” “Hi Mr. Bunn, my name is Java. I realize someone might hear me. That’s the idea, I am trying to find her.” “Who’s her?” “The lady I came in with.” “Oh, it is your first time at the office, huh? All of you guys act like this on the first night. However, take it from experience, son. These people here are too busy to pay any attention to you.” “Not her, she is different. You’ll see!” I try to collect my thoughts when suddenly I hear her voice: “Has anyone seen my Java cup? I left it here last night.” Yeah, that is right. I remember now. We took this long drive in her car and ended up in some big room, where there were many people. People yelling back and forth about something. I must have fallen asleep; I don’t remember her leaving. It must have been some sort of meeting, about all of that stuff we look at each morning. Don’t know, don’t care. All I care about now, is I am with her again. By her side. It was almost fun; I was able to see her at work too. As she picked me up I could hear her whisper, “You poor thing, I left you here all night by yourself. I could not even enjoy the news this morning, how could I have left my favorite Java cup? I promise to make it up to you tonight.” Oh, her voice. So sweet, so soft and I could fill the chills run down my handle as I felt her sweet lips on my brim. As I sit and watch the people pass by, the daylight begins to fade to dark. I think about how wonderful my life is. And how proud I am to be her Java cup. Giggling to myself, I think that this feeling is almost as sweet as cream and sugar and as warm as the java in my cup. But nothing is quite as beautiful. Published on July 8, 1999--- #### Rena Rogers Rena Rogers is a writer and former coffee house owner.

# Keeping Your French Press Clean [Brewing Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/brewing-coffee/)---by [Alex Nathanson](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/alex-nathanson/)![Keeping Your French Press Clean](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/keeping-your-french-press-clean/dirtyfilter1.jpg) We can’t stress this one enough: a clean French Press is vital to good-tasting coffee. Fortunately, cleaning a French Press isn’t difficult and only takes a few minutes. There are only a few pieces to worry about — just make sure you pay attention the first time you take it apart so you’ll know how the parts go back together once they’re clean. In the beginning, we were a little concerned about using soap to clean the pot. After all, we didn’t want any nasty lemony detergent getting caught in the plunger screen and affecting the taste of our coffee. So the usual daily procedure involved dumping out the old grounds in the trash, giving a quick spin of the plunger screen in hot water to get rid of the grounds, rinsing the whole thing again, and wiping it dry with paper towels. It seemed clean enough, but as the weeks went by, we noticed our coffee beginning to taste bitter. No matter what we did, we couldn’t get a decent pot brewed.![dirty french press filter](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/dirtyfilter1.B2X2_nwM_1WqISk.webp)_French Press filter prior to cleaning_ Turns out, that coffee leaves behind quite a bit of oily residue on the plunger screen and inside the pot. Hot water alone will not get rid of it, and after time those oils can turn rancid and affect the taste of your coffee. The good news is that most press pots are dishwasher safe. Simply unscrew the plunger screen and put all the pieces into your dishwasher. We put the plunger pieces in the silverware basket to keep them from flying all around the dishwasher. Everything comes out sparkling and all the soap residue is gone. Since it’s not practical or convenient for most people to take their pots home daily, we recommend taking them home for a good dishwashing on Fridays at least 2-3 times per month. A daily hot water rinse and making sure to take apart the screen and plunger assembly seems to be enough during the week. Put a drop or two of mild dish soap in (or a teaspoon of baking soda instead), fill the carafe with hot water, and let everything soak for a few minutes. Just be sure to rinse all the parts very thoroughly in very hot water to remove all the soap residue. Take a close look at all the parts and see if you notice any coffee residue coming off onto your paper towels. NOTE: if you use an “unbreakable” polycarbonate (plastic) carafe like the Bodum Brazil, baking soda will do a better job of cleaning it than dish soap without leaving residue. One last important point — we strongly recommend dumping the old, spent coffee grounds in the trash instead of tossing them down the drain. Even with a good garbage disposal, you may risk clogging the sink, and we’re sure you don’t want to have to explain that to the facilities and maintenance folks. A few grounds are fine, just not the entire pot full.

# Keep Your Coffee Equipment Clean [Brewing Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/brewing-coffee/)---by [Ryan Jacobs](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/ryan-jacobs/)![Keep Your Coffee Equipment Clean](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/keep-your-coffee-equipment-clean/soda.jpg) Drinking coffee at home is a wonderful experience. It is nice to brew a great cup of coffee for yourself in the morning or to serve your guests after dinner. However, in order to continue making great coffee, you need to make sure that your equipment is clean. Here you see some examples of equipment that aren’t as clean as they need to be. Okay, you caught me. The glassware on the left is downright filthy. The glassware on the right demonstrates how clean the glassware could and should be. Since not all equipment can be cleaned in the same way, I will discuss each type separately. ### The Toolkit To keep coffee equipment clean, you will need to have some basic equipment, which is listed below: 1. Baking Soda: This is great for cleaning plastic or glass. It is especially useful on plastic because regular soap is very hard to rinse from plastic. 2. Dishwashing Detergent: This should be used to clean glass or ceramic only. It will leave a film on some plastics that will be hard to get rid of. 3. Vinegar: This is used to remove mineral deposits from your Automatic Drip coffee pot. 4. Puro Caff: This is like baking soda on steroids and is useful for cleaning your espresso machine. ### Drip Coffee Maker To maintain your Auto Drip coffee maker, you will want to do a basic cleaning weekly and a thorough cleaning at least monthly. The purpose of the thorough cleaning is to remove mineral deposits that may build up in your coffee maker. These deposits will eventually clog up the piping inside the machine and will give off flavors to your brew. Some modern drip makers have built-in filters that actually will trap a great deal of these minerals in the filter before brewing. To avoid doing all this, you can use distilled water only for your coffee. Most people won’t go to such extremes, though.**Do the following weekly:**1. Clean the Carafe: Remove the plastic lid if possible and soak in dish detergent. Soak this while cleaning the lid and the filter basket. 2. Filter Basket: Fill your sink about halfway with warm water and at least four tablespoons of baking soda. Using a rag, wipe the residue coffee oils from the plastic components. Rinse thoroughly with water. 3. Finish cleaning the carafe by swirling the soapy water around a bit with a cleaning rag. Rinse thoroughly with water. You may even want to rinse this with a baking soda solution to fully rinse. 4. Using the rag that was in the baking soda, wipe around the coffee maker itself. Pay close attention to the showerhead as many old coffee oils will be there.**Do the following monthly:**1. Perform your weekly cleaning routine. 2. If you have a filter built into your coffee maker, remove it. Fill your carafe with water and add two tablespoons of vinegar to it. 3. Pour into the coffee maker and begin brewing. 4. Halfway through the brewing cycle, stop the machine and wait 10-15 minutes. Resume the brewing process until it is completed. 5. Rinse your carafe out and brew another one to two cycles of plain water through the system. Rinse out the coffee maker and you are done!![dirty filter](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/dirty_filter.DmXGWyy9_Z1IiRY.webp) ![clean basket](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/clean_basket.C0ZKtqx1_Z1Dotg8.webp) _The drip filter before and after cleaning._### French Press Fully cleaning a French Press may seem like a bit more work, but after you do it once or twice, it becomes second nature.![french press disassembled](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/press.DyN5UeKz_1XYnH3.webp)_French Press disassembled_1. Disassemble the French press completely, as shown in the photo above. 2. Soak all components in a bath of soapy water if you have the glass kind. If it is a plastic press, you will want to soak it in a baking soda bath. 3. After about ten minutes, grab your cleaning rag and use it to clean the equipment thoroughly. 4. If you had the glass press, rinse it in a baking soda solution to help make sure all the soap comes away from the parts. 5. Allow all parts to air dry. 6. Reassemble. 7. Anticipate your next brew!![dirty press](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/dirty_press.ByAt-XAW_sOkku.webp) ![clean press](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/clean_press.8FXbDv97_Z14MwmF.webp) _The Press Pot before and after cleaning._### Espresso Machine As I mentioned earlier, to fully clean an espresso machine, you will need a special cleaner like Puro Caff. I need to mention that you do need to heed the warnings on the package about using very small quantities of this cleaner. It is incredibly strong, and a little will go a long way. If you use your machine regularly, you should perform this cleaning task at least once a week to keep it brewing quality shots. I will not even mention descaling your espresso machine, because I am a firm believer that you should use only distilled water in your espresso machine. By using only distilled water, you will keep your machine running longer. 1. Remove the handle from the espresso machine if you haven’t already. If there is still an espresso cake left in it, dump it and give the handle a good rinse with warm water. 2. Pour 1 tsp. of Puro Caff into the filter basket. With your espresso machine ready to brew, put the handle in the espresso machine just like you were going to brew some shots. 3. Put a bowl under the brewing group. Begin pulling the ‘shots’. You will want to brew for about five seconds, stop brewing for fifteen seconds, and then back on again for five seconds. Repeat this on/off process at least five times. 4. Next, remove the handle from the machine and rinse it with water. Turn your machine on without the handle in it and turn it on to fully rinse the group. 5. Next, using the brush for your espresso machine, work your way around the groove in the brewing group. Once you have successfully cleaned this, turn it on to give the showerhead another rinse. You are now finished! Hopefully, you will be on your way to cleaner and more enjoyable coffee. Remember, no one likes to clean, but doing it properly will keep the quality of your favorite beverage consistent and high.

# Kona Coffee Confusion [Coffee Business](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/coffee-business/)---by [Michael Allen Smith](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/michael-allen-smith/) I forgot the exact dollar amount, but a friend told me during college that they got a full pound of Hawaiian Kona coffee at a price that seemed too good to be true. I looked at the bag; sure enough, it had a picture of Hawaii and a Kona label, and then I saw the word Style. I learned from one of my early coffee mentors that the word Style usually means there is no Kona coffee in the blend. > Kona Style indicates a blend of coffee beans roasted in the _Style_ a Kona would be roasted. Pretty sneaky? Or one might think it was fraudulent. The more common way a lower-priced Kona Coffee is sold to the public is by putting the term _Blend_ beside Kona. How much Kona is in a _Kona Blend_? INeedCoffee contributor and Kona Coffee farmer Gary Strawn answered this question in his article Kona Blends. > If you purchase Kona coffee from a store anywhere other than Kona, you are very likely purchasing a Kona Blend. Here in Hawaii there is a state law that requires a minimum of 10% Kona coffee and the percentage has to be written on the label. On the mainland there is no such law so a “Kona Blend” might be 0% Kona coffee. Even at 10%, that means a Kona blend is 90% cheaper filler beans. Even 10% seems fraudulent to me. It did to others as well. A bill (HB931) that would have increased the state law minimum of 10% to 51% was introduced. That bill failed to make it to a committee, and in the same post, Gary Strawn details how what started as a decent idea turned into a bill that he couldn’t even support. What do you need to know when it comes to Kona Coffee? - AVOID: Kona Roast – Most likely has 0% Kona coffee. - AVOID: Kona Style – Most likely has 0% Kona coffee. - AVOID: Kona Blend—It contains just 10% Kona coffee if purchased in Hawaii and as little as 0% if purchased elsewhere. - BUY: 100% Kona Coffee – Island coffee is exceptional and will cost more. Make sure you get 100% Kona. ### Better Than 100% Kona Coffee? INeedCoffee contributor Andrew Hetzel thinks Hawaii can do better than labeling the coffee 100% Kona. In his article _“Kona Coffee Needs a Quality Grading System,” he makes a case for Hawaiian Kona coffee to participate in a coffee cupping and grading system already used_ in other parts of the world. > Whereas in many regions of the world, coffees are cupped regularly and systematically evaluated by the producer 1) for their own internal quality improvements, 2) to communicate flavor profile with buyers, and 3) to objectively promote cup quality, in Kona, the process is largely left to chance. **Hawaii’s coffee grading system currently monitors only the number of faults in each green sample and screen size of the bean; no consideration whatsoever is given to the resulting flavor.** The article explains that 100% Kona coffees will have different quality and flavor profiles. Some should be priced higher than others. His proposal is an open grading system. > The argument posed by the small farming community is that by diluting a pure Kona coffee product, you are damaging the reputation of the brand — but that argument is only half correct and makes the false assumption that 100% Kona is always 100% good quality. This is, unfortunately, not always the case.![](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/kona-ai.DoD6L_7X_Z1bbT9f.webp) ### Sources [Kona Blends](https://web.archive.org/web/20161005210039/http://www.konaearth.com/Life/2009/090216/) – By Gary Strawn of Kona Earth Coffee.

# Kruve Coffee Sifter Review and Video Tutorial [Grinding Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/grinding-coffee/)---by [Chris Arnold](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/chris-arnold/)![Kruve Coffee Sifter Review and Video Tutorial](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/kruve-coffee-sifter-review/kruve-coffee-sifter-review.jpg) So you have upgraded your beans, your grinder, and maybe a dozen other things in search of the perfect cup of coffee. But if you quest for more, the Kruve Coffee Sifter may be for you, as it promises to take your grind to the next level by giving you only the particle size you desire. Kruve’s motto is _“Many Have Tried To Perfect The Grinder. We Perfected The Grind.”_ Let’s take a closer look at how it works. The Kruve system works by taking the coffee you have ground and sifting it through two sizes of sieves. The oversized and undersized particles are trapped, giving you a specific, narrow range of coffee particle sizes suitable for the type of coffee you are brewing. Otherwise, you may end up with over-extraction or under-extraction, often causing a bitter or weak cup of coffee. Kruve believes sifting to a narrow range of coffee particle size is an important step in getting the best cup of coffee and is finally available to the consumer using sieves with precision photo-etched holes, which are much more precise than the older mesh style used mostly by professionals. Kruve also contends that even very expensive coffee grinders are incapable of providing a narrow enough range of coffee ground size, so there are benefits to the professional and consumer alike: - Higher TDS (Total Dissolved Solids) while still having a clean cup (think of less mud in French Press) - Consistent preparation, cup after cup - The ability to speak a common language when it comes to particle size, making recipe sharing easier - The ability to calibrate a grinder after cleaning or burr replacement ### Sifter Overview The Kruve Coffee Sifter “Twelve” model comes with 3 trays, a lid, and 12 different-sized sieves that allow you to dial in the grind, getting only the range of grind size you desire, regardless of whether you prefer French Press, Espresso, AeroPress, or Pourover. No electricity is required. Sieve sizes included in microns (μm) are 200, 250, 300, 350, 400, 500, 600, 700, 800, 900, 1000, and 1100.![Kruve Coffee Sifter and Sieves](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/P1000254-650x415.CYmUK-2w_Z2iOk3V.webp)_Kruve Sifter_### Using the Kruve The Kruve comes with three trays and a lid. The larger-sized sieve of your range is placed on the top tray, and the smaller-sized sieve is placed in the middle tray.![Kruve Coffee Sifter Trays](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/P1000255-650x554.B19i_NO0_1LBWdp.webp)![Kruve Coffee Sifter Trays and Sieves](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/P1000256-650x502.BjH046RS_Z1kgx6h.webp)![Kruve Coffee Sifter with Coffee Ready to Sift](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/P1000257-650x489.Cgp5gDlL_Z1oW21X.webp) For instance, if you want to do AeroPress, Kruve recommends 500-900μm (microns). So the 900μm sieve would go in the top, and the 500μm would go in the middle. The idea is that everything between 500-900μm ends up in the middle tray, and all the coarser and finer coffee grounds end up in the top and bottom, respectively. After inserting the appropriate sieves, you load your coffee into the top tray and shake like crazy for about 60 seconds. I found that a paint-mixer motion seemed to be very effective, but adopt your own style. Now, you have perfectly sized coffee grounds in the middle tray. Kruve says you may even be able to regrind the coarser stuff from the top tray to eliminate waste even further. Consult your coffee grinder manufacturer to see if your grinder is designed to handle anything other than whole beans.![Kruve Sifted Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/P1000258-2-650x251.Dc2nSncT_Z1eo5eb.webp) ### Grinder Calibration Kruve recommends you “calibrate” your grinder to minimize waste. What this really means is for a given range of particle size, try to set your grinder so as many particles as possible fall into that range, and try to get about 50-50 between the oversize and undersize. You start at a fairly coarse setting with 10 grams of coffee, and after sifting, check the ratio between oversize and undersize until you get about 50-50, going finer each time. You will need to repeat the process for each range of coffee and make note of the grinder setting so you can repeat it. ### Hands-On Taste Test & Observations We tried both French Press and AeroPress. Something surprising to us was how inconsistent our $1000+ Ditting bulk grinder was. We were also surprised by the French Press on how fine 600-1000μm actually looked, and the recommended brew time of 10 minutes was more than double what we would normally do. The reality is the French Press done exactly as Kruve recommended was quite flavorful, had plenty of good oils, and silt (mud) was almost non-existent. The AeroPress was also quite good, but AeroPress isn’t usually finicky for us, so the differences were not as stark. Still, a darn great result. We want to try this on espresso and drip and may have an update on these in the future. However, we don’t see ourselves using this as much for a single shot of espresso, mainly because of the extra prep time. We would, however, use the Kruve when making coffee in larger amounts. ### Improvements As good as the Kruve is, there are a few things we would like to see improved. - The sieves are a little tricky to get in, but we found that inserting them with the trays upside down made things easier. Perhaps they will break over time. - Would like a way for the trays to stay together (other than gravity). We thought a magnet system could work, but once they are together, they are fine as long as you keep a firm grip on the assembled unit. - Would like the option to buy extra trays at a discount, so we could have more than one range (2 sieve sizes) ready to go. For instance, we would probably keep a French Press, Drip, and Espresso locked and loaded. ### Conclusion The Kruve certainly shows how technology is attempting to improve coffee, and we think they have really hit on something special. Let’s face it, even very high-end grinders are ultimately crushing your coffee beans, and there is no way they can have 100% consistent coffee ground particle size. The Kruve not only allows you to calibrate your grinder to minimize waste but ensures you have exactly what you desire. It’s science! It’s not cheap at $129, but we can recommend this as a way to not only increase your coffee nerd cred but truly improve your coffee brewing experience.

# Kyoto-Style Slow Drip Coffee [Brewing Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/brewing-coffee/)---by [Greg Nolan](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/greg-nolan/)![Kyoto-Style Slow Drip Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/kyoto-style-slow-drip-coffee/Kyoto-Style-Slow-Drip-Coffee.jpg) Kyoto-style slow-drip coffee, also known as slow drip or Kyoto-style coffee, is a coffee brewing style that became popular in Kyoto, Japan. Kyoto-style slow drip coffee is made by letting water slowly, drop by drop, drip over coffee grounds. As this process has evolved, Kyoto-style brewers have become increasingly elegant. They now resemble tall, gilded hourglasses. ### Why the rise in popularity? In recent years, Kyoto-style coffee has become more popular. Many high-end coffee shops have purchased Kyoto-style coffee towers to make iced coffee for their customers. These towers make delicious coffee, and the brewers themselves are a thing of beauty and a coffee conversation starter.![Caffe Vita Kyoto Dripper](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/caffe-vita-cold-drippers.DNfC6rxd_nPle.webp)_Caffe Vita Roastery, Seattle, WA_  ### How does the taste differ? Kyoto-style iced coffee differs from traditional cold brew coffee. Cold brew coffee, often made using a [Toddy](https://ineedcoffee.com/cold-brew-coffee-with-the-toddy-coffee-maker/), involves allowing the entire collection of coffee grounds to soak in water for some time (12-24 hours). This is a full immersion brewing method because the water and beans are in full contact with each other throughout the entire brew. The Japanese iced coffee method is not full immersion because the water is slowly dripped into the coffee grounds and then exits. The differences in the two brewing methods result in two different taste profiles. Cold brew has less acidity than Kyoto-style, which captures more of the high notes that one would taste if the coffee were brewed at a normal temperature. Cold brew also tends to be made as a concentrate and can be very high in caffeine. Iced coffee is brewed at a similar ratio to normal hot brewed coffee. As this style of cold brew becomes more popular, you may be wondering how you can make it at home.![QED Coffee Kyoto Cold Dripper](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/qed-coffee-cold-dripper.CfutMwEO_1k0jAi.webp)_QED Coffee – Seattle, WA_### Make your own Kyoto-Style brew at home Because Kyoto-Style coffee is so delicious, it’s no surprise you will want to make it at home, and it is possible. Cold-drip coffee is made in a three-section brewer. Water is poured into the top section and drips down into the middle section. Coffee grounds are in the middle section, and as each drop works through the coffee, it drips into a collector at the bottom of the brewer. There are two ways to get Kyoto-style cold drip brewers at home. You can either buy one or create one. Kyoto-style brewers are available online. Yama makes one model that makes 6-8 cups and another that makes 25 cups. At the time of this article, the smaller one costs $241 USD, and the larger one is $441 USD. The larger one is more suited for a cafe or for a household that drinks a lot of iced coffee. Besides Yama, other companies such as Nispira and Dutch Q have attractive models of Kyoto-style coffee drippers. If these are too expensive and you are comfortable with tools, you can build one. A DIY guide can help you build your own brewer and cut the price down to about $80 USD._[DIY COLD BREW COFFEE TOWER](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFH-m0H-By8) by Mr. Fix It_### A Budget Alternative Osaka makes a cold coffee dripper that makes 4 cups. The Osaka Cold Brew Dripper costs less than the Yama towers or even the DIY approach. It would be a good introduction to Kyoto-style drip coffee at a lower price point. It also takes up less space in your kitchen.![](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/osaka-coffee-dripper-1-650x433.BWBwYYSV_ZR4ryR.webp) ### Try it! You’re missing out if you’re a coffee aficionado and haven’t tried Kyoto-Style cold brew. Seek out a local coffee shop where you can try cold-drip coffee or start making your own at home. Then you can taste the difference. ### Resources [The Osaka Cold Brew Dripper Tutorial](https://ineedcoffee.com/cold-brew-dripper-tutorial/) – INeedCoffee brewing tutorial.

# Kalita Wave Coffee Brewing Tutorial [Brewing Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/brewing-coffee/)---by [Michael Allen Smith](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/michael-allen-smith/)![Kalita Wave Coffee Brewing Tutorial](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/kalita-wave-coffee-brewing-tutorial/kalita-wave-dripper.jpg) In 2013, I organized a trip for the Coffee Club of Seattle to visit the coffee scene of Olympia, Washington. While there, we visited two locations of Olympia Coffee Roasting, where they were making outstanding pour-over coffee using the Kalita Wave Dripper. This trip inspired me to get one for myself.![kalita wave at Olympia Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/kalita-wave-olympia-coffee-roasters.r-phfg2H_ZIhFgM.webp)_Kalita Wave brewing at Olympia Coffee Roasting_ The Kalita Wave Dripper is a pour-over coffee brewer from Japan with a flat bottom design. The flat bottom design is for a more even extraction. Unlike the [Bonavita Immersion Coffee Dripper](https://ineedcoffee.com/step-step-bonavita-immersion-coffee-dripper-tutorial/) or the [Clever Coffee Dripper](https://ineedcoffee.com/clever-coffee-dripper-review/), the Kalita Wave is not a pour-and-wait, but a hands-on brewing method that requires an even flow of hot water on the grounds. So it resembles a [Hario V60](https://ineedcoffee.com/how-hard-is-a-hario-pour-over/), but with a flat bottom filter. The Kalita Wave Dripper comes in two sizes: #155 and #185. The #155 is smaller and ideal for a single-cup brewer, while the #185 is slightly larger. The Kalita Wave Dripper is available in glass or stainless steel, and the #185 is also available in ceramic.![Kalita Wave empty](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/kalita-wave-empty.BLOpTkoJ_Z98uNE.webp)_Looking down into the stainless steel Kalita Wave Dripper, you will see three holes at the flat bottom where the coffee will exit._  The Kalita does not use a standard-size filter. Depending on which model you purchase, you will need to purchase custom Kalita Wave filters in either the #155 or #185. Other items that are recommended: 1. Glass server. You will be placing the brewer over something to catch the coffee. Kalita makes a 300 ml server for the #155 and a 500 ml for the #185. If you don’t use theirs, I’m sure you can find something in your kitchen that will work. 2. Kitchen scale. We will be weighing both the coffee and the water. Brewing on a kitchen scale will make this process easier and more precise. 3. Electric kettle, preferably with a narrow gooseneck pour spout for flow control. Kalita has their own model, but I prefer the Bonavita kettle because it controls water temperature. 4. Timer. Enough background. Let’s make some coffee! ### #1 Add Filter As stated above, the Kalita Wave Dripper requires its own brand of filters. Depending on your size, place the #155 or #185 filter in the brewer. Then, place the Dripper over the carafe you plan to brew the coffee into.![Kalita Wave Add Filter](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/kalita-wave-side-view-with-filter.Co6dL3cl_ZTUmcM.webp)_For the brewer, you will need either the Kalita #155 or Kalita #185 filter. Standard basket filters will not fit properly._### #2 Rinse Filter with Hot Water (optional) As with most paper filter brewing methods, it is advised to rinse the paper filter. This will reduce any paper residue from getting in the coffee and help the filter cling to the brewer. With the Kalita, pour the water directly into the center and fill quickly. You do not want to pour along the sides, as you risk having the filter bend and lose its shape. The added benefit of using hot water is that it will preheat the server. Once that is done, discard the water.![Kalita Wave Rinsed Filter](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/kalita-wave-with-filter.BmT44ewZ_Zsv3hR.webp)_Rinse the coffee filter using hot water directly into the center, so the edges maintain their form._ However, you do not need to rinse the filter to get an excellent cup of coffee. Erin McCarthy won the 2013 World Brewers Cup with a Kalita Wave, but he did not rinse the filter. From his interview with Kirsten Stamn: > **Don’t rinse the filter.** Because the Wave’s filters are so thin, McCarthy says they won’t impart a papery taste to coffee if you skip the standard pre-brewing rinse. Olympia Coffee Roasting’s instructional video also advises against rinsing. If you decide not to rinse the filter, using hot water to preheat the server is still good practice. ### #3 Add Coffee With most brewing methods, I like to start with a 17-to-1 brewing ratio. This means using 17 parts of water for every 1 part of coffee. We have two sizes of brewers. Here is a recipe to get you started for each one. - #155 model: 300 grams (10.1 oz) water and 17-18 grams of coffee. - #185 model: 500 grams (16.9 oz) water and 29-30 grams of coffee. The coffee grind size will be between Medium and Medium Coarse. See our [Coffee Grind Chart](https://ineedcoffee.com/coffee-grind-chart/) for a visual explanation. The timer will confirm that you have an ideal grind size. The brew time to aim for is between 3:00 and 3:30. If it goes faster, tighten the grind a little. If it goes slower, adjust your grind to be coarser.![kalira Wave Ground Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/kalita-wave-wth-ground-coffee.Dsg9woGR_Z1nu7CN.webp) ### #4 Add Hot Water (Pulse or Continuous Pour) This step in the brewing process will require the most focus. If you are using a scale, place the Kalita Wave Dripper with the ground coffee filter on top of the server and zero it out so it reads zero grams.![setup Kalita Wave](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/kalita-wave-over-carafe.cnTGA49U_Oi8CG.webp)_Zero out the scale before adding water._  There are two schools of thought when it comes to adding hot water. One is that your pour should be slow and steady throughout the brew. The other is the pulse method. This is when you pour, let the coffee pass through the grinds, and repeat during the brew cycle. Both methods work great, but I prefer the pulse method as it is easier. The pulse method involves pouring a small amount of water initially over the grounds, allowing them to bloom. Then, pause, pour again, sometimes using a circular pattern.![Kalita Wave Pour Water](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/kalita-wave-pour-close-up.CDt6Urmx_1We6oD.webp)![Kalita Wave Circular Pour](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/kalita-wave-pour-circle.KL0Enile_2edewY.webp)![Pour water Kalita Wave](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/kalita-water-pour.CvHYW4ws_DWMqW.webp) The most popular method is to pour until the coffee blooms and then use a circular motion for an even extraction. However, I have been served Kalita Wave coffee by a competition-level barista who poured it very slowly directly into the center with no circular motion, which was outstanding. His pouring technique was so gentle that it reminded me of an Olympic diver hitting the water without splashing. Whichever method you use, do not stir the coffee. ### #5 Serve Remove the Kalita Wave Dripper, pour, and enjoy.![Coffee is ready](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/kalita-wave-finished-brewing.qOzTJ4FZ_Zi9cIo.webp) ### Last Words You can still brew with the Kalita if you don’t have a kitchen scale or a fancy kettle. It will just take a little more practice. The coffee scooper in canned coffee weighs about 10 grams. Although I have and use a kitchen scale, I often still use that little yellow scoop I saved from an old can of coffee I bought 20 years ago when I knew far less about coffee. If you don’t have a gooseneck kettle, my advice is to go low and slow when you pour. ### Resources [Pulse Method Pour Video](https://vimeo.com/25068779) – Kalita Wave video by Nicholas Cho showing a pulse method pour.

# Latte Art – Barista Interview and Tips [Brewing Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/brewing-coffee/)---by [Lura Lee](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/lura-lee/)![Latte Art – Barista Interview and Tips](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/latte-art-barista-interview-and-tips/latte-art-pour.jpg) To a home roaster or coffee connoisseur, ordering a latte at a mall-based coffee shop can be a depressing experience. But my head was pounding, and I needed caffeine, so I ordered a latte at Cafe Bravo (formerly known as Shivers and Jitters). I was amazed and thrilled to find that my latte at the bar was adorned with latte art. This is a great sign. No one bothers to learn how to do latte art unless they have a deep and abiding appreciation for espresso. So it was that the latte made by the barista, Mark Christman, was one of the best lattes I’d ever tasted. Later, Mark and I had an opportunity to discuss his introduction to latte art. Below is the interview. An Interview with Mark Christman of _Cafe Bravo_ in Temecula, California**What was your first introduction to latte art?** Mark: I saw a video made by _David Schomer of Espresso Vivace_ in Seattle, called “Caffe Latte Art”.**When did you learn?** I learned how to make Latte Art about 2 years ago.**How many attempts did it take you before you mastered latte art?** I can’t even count that…I’d say 300 drinks.![mark latte art](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/yes300x281.Dqu5WLfX_ZAfsdi.webp)_Mark’s Latte Art_**What designs have you seen in latte art?** I do the leaf, but I’ve seen also seen hearts and some places do letters. The leaf is the most popular design.**Please describe the process of making latte art.** Start with cold milk and a cold pitcher always. Stretch the milk, only when it’s cold and never warm. Once you feel the milk is at body temperature, tuck the wand and get a whirlpool going spinning clockwise. Once your milk is at 155 degrees, shut it off. Tap your pitcher on the counter a few times, bringing the microbubbles to the top, presenting a nice layer of foam. Pull your shot, and espresso with thick crema helps! Cut your shot before it turns white. Tap your pitcher once again giving it a swirl, to mix the steamed milk, and the foam together. Pour your shots right down the middle of your espresso, slowly, not breaking the crema. 3 quarters the way up the cup, rock your pitcher back and forth while bringing it back slowly. Cut back across the top of your drink, creating the stem. Serve fresh and enjoy.![Pouring Down the Middle](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/latte-art-pour.DjV5obj5_Z1r7Uyu.webp)_Pouring Down the Middle_**Do you have any tips for beginners?** Don’t over-stretch, don’t stretch warm milk, have a nice fresh roasted espresso that offers excellent crema, have patience, never let your shots sit, and practice makes perfect.**What kind of equipment do you recommend?** For industrial machines, La Marzocco. For household, La Pavoni.**Can you make latte art at home?** I do.![Latte Art Design](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/latte-art-cool.BVvEfkCO_DP9Mk.webp)_Latte Art Design_**Anything else that you’d like to add?** You can only master latte art with the right beans and the right milk.

# Latte Lingo: The Vocabulary of Coffee [Cafe Culture](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/cafe-culture/)---by [Stefanie Spencer](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/stefanie-spencer/)![Latte Lingo: The Vocabulary of Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/latte-lingo/latte-lingo-coffee.jpg) Have you ever gone into a coffee shop and stared at the gigantic menu of fine print, wishing they would just write it in plain English? Well, I hope I can help! How about a crash course in Italian & French? If that sounds like too much work, we’ll just stick to the _latte lingo_ for now. You’ll be ordering that _tall mocha breve con panna_ in no time. First, the basics: most espresso beverages have a base of milk. Whole milk is _latte._ Half and half is _breve._ Heavy cream is _creme._ With whipped cream is _con panna._ Having something _dry_ means only foamed milk, no liquid. You can also have a _rice latte_ or a _soy latte_ instead of regular milk. Then you add the espresso or _caffe._ One shot is equal to one ounce. If you order an espresso, you will get a one-ounce shot of espresso in a _demitasse,_ which is French for _half-cup_ and usually holds about three ounces. An espresso macchiato is a shot of espresso with foam on top, and an espresso creme is an espresso with an ounce of heavy cream. Whether it be a shot of espresso or a shot of flavored syrup, one shot is one ounce. In a short (small) or a tall (medium) drink, there will usually be two shots of espresso, which is called a double or _doppio._ The larger sizes (grande or venti) would contain a triple or three shots. And for the daring, a quad would be four shots.![Espresso macchiato made with half and half.](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/latte-design1.B_zZDwyk_Z2es5Ff.webp)_Espresso macchiato made with half and half._- A _caffe latte_ is steamed with whole milk and espresso. - A _caffe breve_ would be steamed half and half with espresso, very rich; it is my favorite drink. It is okay to leave off the _caffe_ part (i.e. I’ll have a latte) because they assume you are not asking for just a cup of steamed milk, but need some caffeine to get you going! - The same goes for a _mocha,_ which just means chocolate, but if you ask for a _mocha_ they will assume you are asking for a _mocha caffe latte,_ not just chocolate. - A _cappuccino_ is usually 1/3 espresso, 1/3 milk, and 1/3 foam. - A _dry cappuccino_ is made with espresso and foam only. - _Caffe au lait_ is drip-brewed coffee with steamed milk. - An _Americano_ is an espresso with hot water; similar to drip coffee, but with a little different flavor. - Most coffee shops also have a [Toddy](https://ineedcoffee.com/cold-brew-coffee-with-the-toddy-coffee-maker/) or the cold-brewed coffee I spoke of last month. These drinks are all assumed to be hot unless you ask for iced. Although in Arizona on a hot afternoon you will have to watch them closely because they might assume that you want iced. Some common additions and subtractions are _con panna,_ with whip cream. _No foam_ is just as it sounds because a normal latte will have a 1/4 to 1/2 inch of foam at the top, which some people do not enjoy. _Half-caf,_ one-shot regular, and one-shot decaf. _Decaf,_ all shots are decaf. _With room_ is to leave room at the top for cream. _Add a shot of ______ can be for any flavored syrup such as vanilla, caramel, or hazelnut. Now, let’s put it all together. Start with the size, then you can specify iced (if you don’t, they will assume hot), then the drink, and finally any additions/subtractions. Okay, so we could order a _tall latte con panna_ – translation – a medium cup of steamed whole milk, two shots of espresso, with whipped cream. A _short dry cappuccino_ is a small cappuccino with only foam. And now, my current favorite drink is a large (or venti) decaf iced breve with one shot of caramel. This is Stefanie reminding you to enjoy life, one cup at a time.![](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/coffee-drinks-book.Bww9ncAz_CVev4.webp) *Coffee Drinks: An illustrated infographic guide to what’s in your cup by Merlin Jobst *_Title Photo by [Matt Hoffman](https://unsplash.com/@__matthoffman__)._ Published on July 29, 2017--- #### Stefanie Spencer Stefanie writes for the Voice in the Desert newspaper, a local paper serving Cochise County, Arizona.

# Lola’s Cinnamon Syrup Iced Coffee [Recipes](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/coffee-recipes/)---by [Lola Low](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/lola-low/)![Lola’s Cinnamon Syrup Iced Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/lolas-cinnamon-syrup-iced-coffee/Cinnamon-Syrup-Iced-Coffee.jpg) You know the feeling of waking up each morning from a sleepy haze, stumbling out of bed blurry eyed wishing it was a Saturday. You have to be at your desk in an hour. You know the drinks machine will sit humming in the background, trying to lull you into craving a cup of plastic-tasting brown water that has been flashed past a couple of grains of instant before landing in a polystyrene cup. Only a couple of weeks ago I would have told you I unquestionably hate coffee. The bitter taste. The overly-rich aroma. And not to mention the death breath after taste. Having been used to instant coffee, I now understand my former hate for it.![Cinnamon Syrup Iced Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/cinammon-coffee-drink1.COAcFjiY_2gI4D9.webp)_Cinnamon Syrup Iced Coffee_ Working for a wholesale coffee supplier has converted me into a coffee enthusiast. I’ve only been at Cafe Rico a couple of weeks, and although still not keen on straight coffee, syrups are my latest addiction. Although there are loads of flavours; white chocolate, vanilla, mint, almond, banana, and amaretto; cinnamon is my favourite. Reddish-brown in colour, and made from natural fruits, nuts, spices, water, and syrup, Monin syrups have transformed my view of coffee. My love for these syrups has got me making all kinds of concoctions. With summer looming, I thought it a good idea to try creating some kind of iced coffee creation. So I set about digging ice from the depths of my Arctic freezer, dusted off my blender, and stuck the kettle on. To try this iced creation, you’ll need: - Colombian coffee (make it as strong or weak as you like) - Monin cinnamon coffee syrup (Not too much as it can be overpowering – about a teaspoon) - Whipped Cream - Cinnamon sprinkles - Lots of ice - Milk (the amount depends on how strong you like it)![Monin cinnamon coffee syrup](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/monin-syrup-coffee-drink.BNDtGWTK_ZGdI3x.webp)_Monin cinnamon coffee syrup_### Directions 1. Mix the hot coffee with the desired amount of cinnamon syrup. 2. Blend the ice and milk together and stir in with the coffee and syrup. 3. Top with whipped cream and cinnamon sprinkles. Having devised this iced coffee infusion with coffee syrup means I now enjoy sweet-tasting coffee. No longer are there huge granules of white sugar sitting at the bottom of my cup like sand at the bottom of a tide pool until gulped down in one grainy, sugary mouthful. Cinnamon is the best; a slightly spicy, strong, piquant flavour certainly brightens up my day. And my cup of coffee. ### Resources [The Coffee Avocado Shake Recipe](https://ineedcoffee.com/the-coffee-avocado-shake/) – A delicious coffee-based drink recipe from the Philippines.

Published on July 16, 2013--- #### Lola Low Since joining Cafe Rico, Lola has developed a taste for coffee. Although she used to hate it, she now loves her coffee and is a dab hand at creating innovative recipes, especially with coffee syrups as they are her new addiction.

# LifStyl Milk Frother Review [Brewing Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/brewing-coffee/)---by [Chris Arnold](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/chris-arnold/)![LifStyl Milk Frother Review](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/lifstyl-milk-frother-review/LS-frother1.jpg)_**2016 UPDATE:** The LifStyl Milk Frother is no longer available for sale._ I was disinterested when I was first offered a chance to try out another milk frother. After all, there are many milk frothers out there; hand-powered milk frothers, battery-powered wand-type milk frothers, those attached to lower-end espresso machines, as well as those milk frothers that are the size of espresso machines. All these have one thing in common: they suck in one way or another, whether it is function, form, or price. I will tell you that the LifStyl Milk Frother is not like the others I have tried in any of those ways. If you don’t want to read any further, just hit the product link and buy it now. That is how much I love it. Otherwise, read on to find out why it has become a daily part of my routine.![LS frother](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/LS-frother1.FgX3YHtA_1h4biH.webp) Most of us that use cream or milk in our drip coffee or espresso, use it cold (at least in the US). Of course that reduces the temp of the coffee, and we don’t all have (or want) an espresso machine to steam a whole pitcher of milk just for a cup of coffee, especially when in a hurry. Even if you have a high-end espresso machine, sometimes you just don’t feel like going through the process of steaming milk and the resulting cleanup (it usually takes me about 5 minutes from start to finish this way).![frother bottom](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/frother-bottom-558x650.CuKAE9qs_Z1t5ODh.webp)![inside empty frother](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/frother-inside-empty.D45BrByF_Z2denWi.webp) This is where the LifeStyl milk frother swoops in and saves the day. The LifStyl milk frother consists of 4 parts: 1. Main pitcher (with markings inside to help you not underfill or overfill). 2. Base 3. Lid 4. Metal whisk called a Spring Head (leave it on and it froths; take it off and it doesn’t) The LifStyle milk frother is very simple to use & clean (about 90 seconds from start to finish) 1. Decide if you want froth or not, and add/remove the Spring Head accordingly 2. Add milk, half & half, soy milk, rice milk, or even skim milk! 3. Put pitcher on base 4. Put the lid on the pitcher 5. Press button 6. 60 seconds later, you have a perfect 145-158F product 7. Pour into your coffee 8. Rinse and wipe inside![frother](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/frother-1.Bb9k0RQY_1uP1Cm.webp) I only ran into one thing I would like to see changed on future models: the ability to adjust how “foamy” or “frothy” the milk gets as it reaches temp. In my case, using half & half, although the full 60 seconds brought it to temp, it was a little too foamy. One option recommended by the manufacturer is to simply hit the button early, which does work. The only downside is that the temp is a little lower than optimum, but it’s a very nice compromise. And they were very receptive to my suggestions for future products.![frothing](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/frothing.C70gZzVN_1YhrKg.webp)![milk frothing](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/milk-frothing.C7h0Y2Kc_Zuki3A.webp) I really love this product in so many ways, and it’s affordable to boot. I can highly recommend the LifStyl Electric Frother to anyone who wants an easy, affordable way to heat or froth their milk or nondairy products. And that includes you high-end espresso snobs; you would be surprised how easy the LifStyl is and how nice the results are. ### Pros - Froths & warms in just 60 seconds - Warms only (no foam) - Foam quality and consistency are great - Operation is dead simple - The pitcher is cordless and has a cool base - Very Quiet - Cleanup is easy, thanks to a non-stick interior - Small Footprint - Relatively low energy use (550 Watts) - Relatively low cost: about $40 for frother ### Cons - Could use a way to adjust the foam level![frothed beverage](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/frothed-beverage.D14ebxPZ_2k9LqR.webp) ### Resources_The LifStyl Milk Frother (no longer available)_[Sherwood SMF-1000 Automatic Electric Milk Frother and Warmer Review](https://ineedcoffee.com/sherwood-smf-1000-automatic-electric-milk-frother-warmer-review/) – INeedCoffee article._Disclosure: INeedCoffee was sent this product at no cost, which did not affect its review._ Published on August 1, 2013--- #### Chris Arnold Chris is the creator of Two Bit History.

# Lola’s Iced Chocolate Espresso [Recipes](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/coffee-recipes/)---by [Lola Low](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/lola-low/)![Lola’s Iced Chocolate Espresso](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/lolas-iced-chocolate-espresso/Iced-Chocolate-Espresso.jpg) So here I am, back again with another syrup recipe, I have conjured up over the summer months. My love for coffee syrups has grown and grown, and so has my bank of recipes. Here is one that I thought you might enjoy. This is a personal favorite for a mid-morning pick-me-up. My early mornings are spent in commuter traffic, horns non-stop and cars bumper to bumper. When I finally arrive at work, I am confronted with a large pile of posts to open and five tasks on my desk to be completed by lunchtime. So by the time 11 o’ clock strikes, I am first to the kitchen to make my creation. I don’t always remember the ice, but cold milk alone is better than no iced chocolate espresso at all.![Iced Chocolate Espresso](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/iced-espresso-monin1.pwOTzFLV_Z27esPU.webp)_Iced Chocolate Espresso_ Here is how to make my iced chocolate espresso: ### You will need: - 1 or 2 shots of espresso (Depending on how strong you like it, I prefer 2) - Cold milk (Again, the amount depends on how milky you like your coffee) - Monin chocolate coffee syrup - Whipped cream - Chocolate dust/sprinkles - Ice ### Directions: 1. Fill your glass with ice 2. Add cold milk 3. Stir in your shot/s of espresso and one teaspoon of chocolate syrup 4. Top with whipped cream and chocolate dust/sprinkles The beauty of this creation is that you can make the drink as strong or weak as you like. If you are a die-hard espresso fan, opt for more espresso shots and just a dash of milk. If you prefer your coffee weak, opt for more milk than coffee.![Iced Chocolate Espresso with Whipped Cream](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/iced-espresso-whipped-cream-cinnamon.BSkkh9FH_10wpum.webp)_Iced Chocolate Espresso with Whipped Cream_ This is my latest coffee syrup addiction and is a perfect pick-me-up with a sweet kick. Since joining Cafe Rico in June I have created several recipes, which I like to share with my fellow coffee enthusiasts. I still love my cinnamon syrup iced coffee, but have been trying out new syrups regularly to spice things up. I decided I needed to make something with a bit of a kick to help me through the morning. Lots of Monin coffee syrups are available, including almond, amaretto, white chocolate, and mint. I used to hate coffee until I started working for a wholesale coffee supplier and decided it was time to confront my coffee fears. If you like mochas, you’ll love my iced chocolate espresso. I haven’t looked back, but I will post more of my recipes soon! ### Resources [Lola’s Cinnamon Syrup Iced Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/lolas-cinnamon-syrup-iced-coffee/) – Another coffee recipe.

# How to Make Cascara Tea in a French Press [Tea](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/tea/)---by [Michael Allen Smith](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/michael-allen-smith/)![How to Make Cascara Tea in a French Press](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/make-cascara-tea-french-press/cascara-tea-french-press.jpg) Cascara has been gaining popularity in coffee circles in the past few years. With Starbucks releasing its own Cascara Latte, the term will soon become commonly known to many who frequent cafes or read coffee websites. Cascara is the dried outer skin of a coffee cherry. In Spanish, cascara means peel or fruit skin. It is collected during the pulping process. Usually, the coffee producer uses the wet production method, but some cascara is now being collected from producers using natural production. These cascara skins are sometimes dried to be used as tea. Cascara is not technically tea, as tea comes from the camellia sinensis plant. This is explained in our article [A Coffee Lover’s Guide to Tea](https://ineedcoffee.com/a-coffee-lovers-guide-to-tea/). However, it is being used increasingly to make a tea-like beverage. When brewed as tea, cascara is delicious. It tastes fruity with notes of cranberries and honey. And cascara tastes great both hot and iced. In this tutorial, we will make a pot of cascara tea using a 34-ounce French Press. You can use a mason jar if you don’t have a French Press. Using the French Press just makes the filtering process easier.![](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/650cascara-009.xBHtF6Qz_ZjJodO.webp) ### The Ratios There are wildly different recipes for making cascara tea. I’ve seen brewing ratios as strong as 10:1 (10 parts water to 1 part tea) and as weak as 20:1, but many use ratios between those two outliers. Different cascaras at different levels of freshness will taste good at different ratios. Unlike coffee, which requires more precision, cascara is more forgiving of the dose. For this tutorial, we are going to use a 15:1 ratio. This is a good middle ground. If you find it too sweet, you can reduce the amount of cascara you use the next time or add more water. If it isn’t sweet enough, you can add more cascara or extend the brew time. ### #1 Add Cascara To French Press Add 10 Tablespoons or 60 grams of cascara tea to a large French Press.![](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/650cascara-011.D22Zw6Tg_1sCSDv.webp) ### #2 Add Hot Water and Fill French Press Heat water to boiling and fill French Press. Normally when brewing actual tea leaves you would not use water this hot – but this is not tea (camellia sinensis) – so it is brewed in the same manner as other herbal teas, which is just off the boil.![](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/650cascara-015.oIRdZgoX_ZmvyGW.webp) ### #3 Steep Cascara For 4 Minutes and Stir Begin the 4-minute steep. Gently stir a few times during the brew with a chopstick. Our goal is to ensure that all the cascara is making contact with the hot water.![](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/650cascara-019.B_xofWiX_Emc1Q.webp) ### #4 Push Down and Serve There is no need to slam the filter down. Move it slowly, as the cascara will put up less resistance than you would experience when brewing coffee.![](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/650cascara-023.DDk-rFqW_1rwhJq.webp)![](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/650cascara-024.C6cYuvBS_Z1g8Sxi.webp) Enjoy your cascara hot or over ice. Jar whatever you don’t use and refrigerate for later use. ### 2nd Steep Like many tea varietals, you can steep your cascara tea a second time. It won’t be as sweet as the first steep, but it should still taste rich. Some people who find the first steep too sweet may prefer the second steep more. Follow the same instructions as above, but extend the brew time to 6 minutes.![](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/cosori-french-press500.vZu9lEg-_2tTOaF.webp)_The Cosori French Press / Tea Press_### Cascara Concentrates Until now, we have just made regular cascara tea. We can also make cascara concentrates in the same manner as above with a few changes. Cascara concentrates will be used in drinks that require a much stronger cascara flavor, such as cascara lattes, homemade sodas, and even cocktails. For cascara concentrates, we are going to increase our ratio to 10:1, which means using 90 grams of cascara for our 34-ounce French Press. We will also extend our brew time to 15 minutes. Another concentrated brewing option is to brew the cascara like you would a [cold brew coffee in a French press](https://ineedcoffee.com/making-cold-brew-coffee-french-press/). Place the cascara in the French press, add cold water, and allow it to sit on the counter for 12-24 hours. This is one way to make a stronger extract, but it is not necessary to wait that long. My preference is to increase the amount of cascara by 50% and brew for 15 minutes. Adjust according to taste. ### How Much Caffeine is in Cascara? Although there is some debate on how much caffeine is in cascara, a growing consensus is that caffeine levels are around 25% of brewed coffee on an ounce-by-ounce basis. I feel a jolt from cascara, but that is likely because I tend to drink more of it due to its sweet nature. If this topic is of interest, see the article [The Great Caffeine Debate](https://unionroasted.com/blogs/latest/the-great-caffeine-debate) by Union Hand Roasted Coffee. They measured the levels of two different varietals of cascara. Square Mile Coffee Roasters also performed caffeine tests, as shown in [Cascara and Caffeine](https://web.archive.org/web/20230603183929/https://squaremileblog.com/2013/08/30/cascara-and-caffeine/). ### Start Brewing! Cascara makes a delicious beverage and is super easy to make. More and more specialty coffee roasters have begun selling loose cascara. One last tip. If you are brewing coffee and cascara tea in the same French Press, be sure to do an excellent job cleaning the filter. This might mean running it in the dishwasher. You don’t want your cascara to taste like the last pot of coffee you brewed. *Brewing photos by Joseph Robertson of Extracted Magazine, a digital coffee magazine published for iOS and Android. * Published on January 1, 2020--- #### Michael Allen Smith Michael Allen Smith is both a coffee fanatic and a web developer.

# How to Make Iced Coffee in a Chemex [Brewing Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/brewing-coffee/)---by [Michael Allen Smith](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/michael-allen-smith/)![How to Make Iced Coffee in a Chemex](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/make-iced-coffee-chemex/how-to-make-iced-coffee-chemex.jpg) It’s time for another coffee brewing tutorial. This time, we are going to make iced coffee with a Chemex. The Chemex is a popular pour coffee brewer, which we covered in detail in the article “ [Chemex Coffee Brewing—History and Tutorial](https://ineedcoffee.com/chemex-coffee-brewing-history-and-tutorial/).” In addition to making great hot coffee, the Chemex does a stellar job of making iced coffee. Before we jump into the tutorial, I want to briefly explain how iced coffee is different from cold brew coffee. Cold-brew coffee, which has been surging in popularity in recent years, takes about 24 hours to make. Iced coffee is different. It just takes the same time it normally takes to make hot coffee. Iced coffee should taste as bright and as flavorful as the hot version without being weak and watery. Iced coffee excels at preserving the same flavor characteristics in the regular brewed hot version. Cold brew will create a low acidity profile and is higher in caffeine. The big theme with making iced coffee is that the water will come from the hot brewing water and ice cubes. A smaller amount of hot water will pass through the coffee grounds. As the coffee brews, it will fall onto the ice cubes. The ice will mostly be melted, but the drink will be chilled and not taste weak or watered down. With the Chemex, the brew time for iced coffee is comparable to that of the hot version. If you want a slow-drip iced coffee, check out our [Cold Brew Dripper Tutorial](https://ineedcoffee.com/cold-brew-dripper-tutorial/).![iced chemex coffee brewing](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/iced-chemex-brewing-close.BYPLcIL__2tGTzW.webp) ### Step by Step Iced Chemex Brewing For this tutorial, we are going to use the 6-cup Chemex. If you have the 3-cup, use half the coffee, hot water, and ice of this recipe. #### Ingredients and Water Math Besides the Chemex, you will need: - 50 grams of coffee - 466 grams of water - 234 grams of ice - Chemex filter - digital scale (recommended) Our brewing ratio will be 14:1, which means 14 parts of water to 1 part of water. This ratio is slightly stronger than the 17:1 we use for hot Chemex. What if you don’t have a scale? Wing it. A general rule is that 1/3 of the water you would normally use should be added first as ice cubes. For the 6-cup brewer, the cubes will be higher than where the brewer curves back up.![iced chemex coffee brewer - ice level](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/iced-coffee-ice-level.BREO2r-m_Z1QjEYw.webp) #### #1 Heat Water You will need enough water for both the hot water portion of the brew and to thoroughly rinse the Chemex paper filter. #### #2 Rinse Filter The Chemex uses a thick paper filter, which can impart a paper-like taste to the coffee. To avoid that, give it a good rinse first. Unlike other brewing methods, in which a quick splash of water is enough, the Chemex needs a longer rinse. Aim for 5-10 seconds. Once the rinse is complete, place the filter aside and dump the rinse water. At this point, give the Chemex a quick rinse with cold water. If we were brewing a normal hot Chemex, we wouldn’t do this step to retain more heat on the glass. #### #3 Add Ice to the Chemex Place 234 grams of ice into the base of the Chemex.![add ice cubes to chemex coffee brewer](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/iced-chemex-add-ice.JEFiKDey_Z1Crncd.webp) #### #4 Place Filter on Chemex and Add Ground Coffee Now that the ice is in the Chemex, return the filter to the top of the Chemex. Place 50 grams of ground coffee into the filter. Use a medium-coarse grind, which is in between a normal drip and a French press grind. See our [Coffee Grind Chart](https://ineedcoffee.com/coffee-grind-chart/) for visual guidance. #### #5 Slowly Pour Hot Water over the Coffee Grounds The hot water pour is the same as on a hot brew; we pour less hot water. From our Chemex Coffee Brewing tutorial: > Once the water reaches boil, remove it from the heat source and let it cool 20-30 seconds before pouring. The initial pour is very important. Instead of pouring all the water onto the grounds as you would with a press pot, only pour enough water to saturate the beans. Chemex states that wetting the grounds allows them to “bloom”. The importance of this step is to get all the coffee in contact with water. After you wet the grounds wait 20-40 seconds. During this time trapped carbon dioxide (CO2) escapes from the grounds. If you can see areas where the coffee is clumping and not contacting the water, you can use a wooden spoon to stir the brew. This is optional. We will be adding 466 grams of water in total. Having a kettle with a gooseneck spout makes this task easy.![iced chemex - add hot water ](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/iced-chemex-pour-water-start.CAguoNIQ_3Yvf3.webp) ### #6 Remove Filter and Serve Once the water has finished passing through the coffee and filter, remove the filter. At this point, the ice should be mostly or fully melted. The coffee should be cold. If you want, you can add ice to your glass before serving coffee. The ice will keep the coffee cold so you have a lot more time to sip on the beverage before it starts to water down.![serve iced chemex coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/iced-chemex-served-close.BAsLupRy_Zy4Dur.webp) ### Last Words We have another tutorial that uses a [Clever Coffee Brewer to make Iced Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/clever-way-make-iced-coffee/). That is still my favorite iced coffee brewing method. However, the larger Chemex sizes (6-cup and 10-cup) are best for making larger batches of iced coffee. If I’m just making an iced coffee for myself, I grab the Clever; however, for friends and family, I use the Chemex. ### Resources [Chemex Coffee Brewing – History and Tutorial](https://ineedcoffee.com/chemex-coffee-brewing-history-and-tutorial/) – INeedCoffee tutorial.

# Make Concentrated Cold Brew Coffee With Penguin Coffee [Brewing Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/brewing-coffee/)---by [Michael Allen Smith](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/michael-allen-smith/)![Make Concentrated Cold Brew Coffee With Penguin Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/make-concentrated-cold-brew-coffee-with-the-penguin-coffee/penguin-coffee-cold-brew.jpg) In the past few years, I’ve seen cold-brew coffee makers get better and better. How does a method of coffee brewing that requires no electricity get better? After all, making cold-brew coffee is really just a few steps: Soak ground coffee in water for a day and then filter out the grounds. How do you improve on that process? Three ways come to mind. 1. Make measuring the coffee and water easier. 2. Create a filter that does a good job of keeping tiny grounds out of the brew. 3. Make it easier to clean up. If the person making the coffee doesn’t mess up the amount of coffee and water needed, then the coffee will turn out great. The cold brew will be clean without sludge if the filter is good. And if the cleanup is easy, the coffee fan will be more likely to make cold brew coffee repeatedly. Enter the Penguin Coffee. The new version of their cold brewer accomplishes all those goals while making a true cold coffee brew concentrate.![penguin coffee cold brew](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/penguin-coffee.BYtKWbn3_GEGWl.webp)_Penguin Coffee Cold Brew_  ### The Penguin Cold Brewer I’ve made cold brew coffee with several brewers. The first thing I noticed about the Penguin is that the glass is much thicker than the others. This is one sturdy cold brewer. If you tap the side of this brewer, it won’t go flying off the counter. The second thing I noticed was the filter. The steel filter uses the smallest holes I’ve ever seen on a cold brew coffee filter. The Penguin product guide says they are microscopic holes. The smaller the holes, the cleaner the coffee. Also, the filter is larger and can hold more coffee than other cold brewers I’ve used.![cold brew steel filter](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/cold-brew-steel-filter.BSJNUQaB_Zmp9xC.webp)_The Penguin Coffee brew steel filter has microscopic holes._ Penguin Coffee Cold Brewer has two models: the 1.2 L makes 725 ml (24.5 ounces) and the 1.6 L makes 975 ml (33 ounces). Let us make some coffee. ### #1 Grind Coffee The 1.2 L model can hold up to 225 grams of coffee, and the 1.6 L model can hold up to 280 grams. You do not need to use that much coffee; those are just the amounts the filter will hold. If you want to make a concentrated cold brew, you’ll want to brew with a near-full filter, but you can always use less coffee. Use medium to medium-coarse ground for the cold brew. See our Coffee Grind Chart for more guidance, but don’t be too concerned with being exact. Cold brew is forgiving. ### #2 Place Filter Inside Glass Carafe The filter makes a tight seal with the glass, so go ahead and place the filter inside, as there is no risk that coffee grounds will get around the filter when added in the next step.![penguin cold brewer](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/penguin-cold-brewer.BWwrQPsn_m74C7.webp)_My 1.6L Penguin Cold Brewer before adding coffee grounds to the filter._### #3 Add Ground Coffee to Filter I often will reach for my AeroPress funnel to load coffee grounds into brewers, but the Penguin filter was wide enough that it wasn’t necessary. I just poured the ground coffee directly into the filter.![add coffee grounds to cold brewer](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/cold-brewer-add-grounds.Bq8mGWIG_Z1haYSe.webp)_The Penguin filled with ground coffee._  ### #4 Fill Brewer with Water Slowly add cold water to the Penguin Brewer until the coffee grounds are covered. The Penguin makes a more concentrated cold brew than other cold brewers on the market, so you will want to cut it with water later. Your other option is to use fewer grounds and more water during the brew. Either will work. For this tutorial, I am using 280 grams of coffee (the 1.6 L) model and filling the brewer with water, which covers all the grounds. ### #5 Wait 24+ Hours Put the lid on top of the brewer and wait. The lid covers the brewer fully, so no dust or bugs will enter your brew. Now place the brewer out of the way for the next day or so. I’ve gotten excellent results from brews between 24 and 36 hours. Here is an optional tip that may or may not help with extraction. I’ve gotten into the habit of periodically lifting the brewer and giving it a gentle wiggle. My thinking is that a little water movement could assist with extraction. Again, this is an optional step.![penguin cold brew](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/brewing-cold-brew.DwOPNgnH_Z12mVgk.webp)_After taking this photo, I added a little more water._### #6 Use Filter Holder to Collect More Coffee After the brew, you’ll want to collect your coffee, but you don’t want to lose the coffee still trapped in the grounds. The Penguin ships with a Filter Holder, which props up the filter so water still trapped inside the coffee grounds can be drained and collected. This is a clever way to capture the most concentrated coffee.![drain cold brew](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/drain-cold-brew.is2ln8A7_Z1gKwxn.webp)_Use the Filter Holder to collect concentrated cold brew from the filter._  ### #7 Remove Filter and Jar I was able to jar just over a quart of cold brew concentrate—I want to stress the word concentrate. For my tastes, I needed to cut it with 1.5 to 2 parts water to 1 part coffee before drinking. If you don’t do this, be prepared for a massive caffeine hit. You can use the Penguin to store your cold brew. I don’t, just because I want to prep my next brew before I run out of the previous brew.![super concentrate cold brew](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/super-concentrate-cold-brew.D8WUomm0_2aANJg.webp)_Cold Brew Concentrate_### #8 Clean Up You can discard the used coffee grounds in a compost bin or your garden. Then, rinse the filter and jar well. Unlike other cold brewers, the filter bottom can be removed for easy cleaning. All of the parts are dishwasher safe for less frequent and deeper cleaning. Occasionally, running the stainless steel parts and glass through the dishwasher can be good. Over months of use, coffee oils can build up on the inside of the filter, and the dishwasher’s super-hot water breaks them up and really cleans the filter.![penguin bottom filter](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/penguin-bottom-filter.n-ExlqSV_Z1PQcr7.webp)_The filter has a removable bottom cap for easy cleaning._### Concentrated Cold Brew Not all cold brewers are equal. The filter sizes and jar sizes vary, which means each brewer will make a cold brew of different strengths, so the level of concentration will vary. The Penguin makes a cold brew that is more concentrated than the other cold brewers I’ve used. Because cold brew is a concentrate, you must cut it with water. How much water is really up to you and what you like. I advise experimenting with your first brew by mixing water with small samples at varying strengths to determine what tastes best for you, whether you use the Penguin or another cold brewer. Once you know your best ratio, you are set.![pour cold brew](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/pour-cold-brew.CP7T6Upg_1wsNRw.webp)_Serve and enjoy!_### Penguin Coffee Review The Penguin Coffee Cold Brewer is my new favorite cold brewer. It is sturdy, doesn’t take up much space, makes a super clean, concentrated cold brew, and is easy to clean up. Because it is twice as concentrated as my previous cold brewer, I now only need to brew half as often, which saves me time as well. If you want to save money by making cold brew at home, I highly recommend the Penguin.**Update:** Version 2.0 is out now, with stronger glass and a better filter. I like how easy it is to remove the end cap of the filter now._Disclosure: This post was sponsored.

# How To Make Cold Brew Coffee At Home [Brewing Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/brewing-coffee/)---by [Chandler Unity](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/chandler-unity/)![How To Make Cold Brew Coffee At Home](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/make-cold-brew-coffee-home/make-cold-brew-coffee-at-home.jpg) Nothing creates demand for cold drinks like hot weather. Every spring and summer, coffee lovers are drawn to iced coffees and frappes to beat the heat. However, many frappes are vaguely coffee-flavored milkshakes and can contain a lot of sugar and calories. Many iced coffees are bitter and end up tasting watered down by all of the ice. However, over the past few years, cold brew coffee has been changing the coffee scene. If you’re the sort of person who wants a cold coffee drink that tastes like coffee, cold brew may be exactly what you’re looking for. A bit more like wine than coffee, cold brew is made by steeping fresh-ground coffee in cold water for hours. Unlike most other coffee brewing methods, which emphasize how fast they can make your cup, cold brewing takes between eight and twenty-four hours to steep all the goodness out of those beans.![](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/cold-brew-finished.CCZdQBEc_29WqNa.webp) However, cold brewing is also unique in that it holds onto so much of the coffee’s flavor. Hot coffee warms up the bean’s aromatic compounds and oils and releases them into the air, which is the reason why fresh coffee smells so great. Cold brewing doesn’t release any of those compounds. So, cold brew tends to have intense flavors that hot coffee doesn’t. Aficionados consider cold brew to be sweet and mellow, with less bitterness and acid characteristics than conventionally made coffee. Cold brew coffee has a long and illustrious history. The Dutch started making something like cold brew coffee in the 1600s. Dutch sailors may have wanted a coffee concentrate that could be stored for long periods of time, but also easily heated and served. The cold brew fever spread to the Japanese, who elevated Kyoto-style cold brew coffee to something of an art form. Today, cold brew coffee is available at many coffee shops in the summer. Even Starbucks makes cold brew coffee now. My adventure with cold brewing started at a coffee shop just down the street from my house. This coffee shop began offering what it called “Dutch-style” coffee last summer. They even have an elaborate cold brewing coffee maker on display. On a whim, I ordered some. This coffee served over ice in the summer, was flavorful and refreshing. While most iced coffees come with loads of sugar and flavorings, that glass of cold brew was great completely solo. So, as soon as the first hints of spring started to appear, I wanted to try my hand at it. Neither do I have a fancy setup like that coffee shop, nor do I have the space for it in my kitchen. Fortunately, cold brew is actually pretty simple to make. I made it at home with almost no special equipment beyond a coffee grinder and a Mason jar. ### Making Cold Brew #### The setup I started by coarsely grinding about a quarter cup of light roast coffee in a blade grinder. In order to really get a sense of how cold brewing affects coffee flavor, I used the same beans I usually use to make my morning cup. The coffee should be ground to about the consistency of breadcrumbs. If the coffee is too finely ground, the resulting coffee can be cloudy, so it’s not a bad thing if the coffee is very coarse. A 1:8 ratio of beans to water is ideal for cold brew, and I was planning to use a two-cup mason jar to hold the mixture while it steeps. I put the mixture in the mason jar, poured cold water over it, and closed it up for the day.![](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/cold-brew-2.S88hFUXu_Z2qlTnl.webp)![](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/cold-brew-start.CUALrJaY_1aE45i.webp) After letting the coffee steep for about ten hours, it was time to strain the cold brew and taste it. Any method for getting the grounds out of the coffee should work. Some instructions I found on the internet suggested skimming the grounds out of the coffee. Others suggested straining the coffee repeatedly. Instead, I used my handy French Press. I poured the still steeping mixture into the press and let it settle for about an hour before pressing down the plunger. The French Press method worked fairly well for me. However, if the coffee remains cloudy after pressing or filtering, it just means that the beans were ground too finely. Using a burr grinder can result in more evenly ground coffee. That means that there will be fewer fine particles floating in the coffee.![](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/cold-brew-french-press.CiSmLm0q_Z1sWMm2.webp) ### The result So, how did it work out? I made delicious cold-brew coffee right at home. I tried it a couple of different ways: plain with ice, and with cream and a little brown sugar. The black coffee was incredible. Even though it was pretty light in color, it was not weak at all. It was rich and extremely flavourful. Because I was using my usual coffee, I could easily compare the hot and cold brews from the same beans. I was really happy to conclude that the cold brew version had a much deeper flavor and less bitterness than what I usually drink in the morning. With added cream and sugar, the coffee was dessert-like.![](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/coldbrew6.DRW1x2HH_ZzJSOl.webp) Compared to other cold coffees, like an iced Americano you can get at Starbucks or your local coffee shop, cold brew has all of the flavors with none of the bitterness. Making cold brew coffee at home is really easy and doesn’t require too much in the way of special equipment.

# How to Make Pour-Over Coffee With the Gabi Drip Master [Brewing Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/brewing-coffee/)---by [Michael Allen Smith](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/michael-allen-smith/)![How to Make Pour-Over Coffee With the Gabi Drip Master](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/make-pour-coffee-gabi-drip-master/gabi-master-dripper-coffee.jpg) When I first received the Gabi Drip Master coffee brewer (aka the Master A), I had no idea how to make coffee with it. I’ve used many other pour-over coffee brewers, but this one was unique. Whereas other pour-over coffee brewers task you with controlling the water flow over the beans, the Gabi Drip Master adds a clever twist. It is designed to collect the water poured and then evenly distribute that water over the beans for you in a more uniform manner. How well does it make coffee compared to other flat-bottom pour-over brewers? I’ll render a verdict at the end of the article. First, let’s make some coffee. ### The Equipment Putting the Gabi Drip Master together the first time is like putting together a puzzle. All the parts collapse into a tight space. We will need to unpack and assemble the brewer.![gabi master A](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/gabi-packagejpg.BpUBF57s_Z4H9XX.webp) Open the shell and pull out the parts.![Gabi Master A Part](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/gabi-brewer-parts.BUo3xrgN_Z1sPCPg.webp) The part in the upper right can be opened to find another section.![Gabi Dripper All Parts](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/gabi-dripper-all-parts.Bx7Dt2fp_2phdnr.webp) Here, we have the entire brewer. On the Top Row, we have the Dripper and Waterspout. Underneath are the Water Bottle and the Multi. We’ll go through each later. Now, all we need is a mug or jar to brew our coffee. ### Measuring the Coffee Also included in the Gabi Drip Master is a scoop incorrectly labeled as 15 grams. It doesn’t hold 15 grams. It holds 6-7 grams of coffee. The mislabeling won’t be a problem because we will keep the math simple. We are going to brew 10 ounces of coffee. This means three scoops will give us approximately 20 grams of coffee. Since 10 ounces is about 300 milliliters, this works out to a brew ratio of 15:1 (15 parts water to 1 part coffee). Probably the second most clever part of the Gabi Drip Master design is that the top chamber holds exactly 150 grams of water. This means two fills will meet our water needs. **There is no need to weigh anything.** The most clever part is the Waterspout, which will be covered later. This is a different recipe than the one included in the instructions. I think mine is better. Feel free to adjust the recipe for your tastes. ### Grinding the Coffee Since this is a flat-bottom pour-over brewer, I used a [medium grind](https://ineedcoffee.com/coffee-grind-chart/), like I would for the [Kalita Wave](https://ineedcoffee.com/kalita-wave-coffee-brewing-tutorial/) or the [Stagg Dripper](https://ineedcoffee.com/stagg-pour-coffee-dripper-review-tutorial/). ## Brewing the Coffee ### #1 Connect the Water Bottle to the Waterspout The Water Bottle fits on top of the Waterspout. Connect the two. The Water Bottle will hold the water before it goes into the Waterspout. Set this aside for now.![Gabi Connect Water Bottle ](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/gabi-part.CeKsnMsU_Z1I1Oh4.webp) ### #2 Rinse the Filter (Optional) The Gabi uses the same 155 series filter as the Kalita Wave. Place the filter in the Dripper and rinse with hot water. Throw out the rinse water. Because the Kalita Wave filter is so thin and there is a debate on if it is best to rinse that filter, I’m labeling this as an optional step. For my tests, I rinsed because I had the brown filters, which impart more of a paper taste to me. If I had the plain white filters, I might not have rinsed. It all depends on whether you can taste the paper in the brew. ### #3 Add Ground Coffee and Place Over Mug Add 20 grams or 3 scoops of medium-ground coffee to the filter. Place the filter into the Dripper and set the Dripper over a mug or jar. For this tutorial, I am using a jar. The Multi is used when the Dripper doesn’t fit your mug. If the Dripper fits your mug, then you won’t need this part.![gabi Add Coffee with Filter](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/gabi-coffee-filter.ILaEkSZT_1g3UO7.webp)_The Dripper here sits on the Multi, like a stand for your mug or jar._  ### #4 Place the Connected Water Bottle / Waterspout Over the Dripper Place the connected Water Bottle and Waterspout onto the Dripper. Now the brew stack is complete.![Gabi Dripper Stacked](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/gabi-setup-stacked.ClrgPe8W_1AYO4H.webp)_Here is the full brew stack. From top to bottom: Water bottle, Waterspout, Dripper (with filter and ground coffee), Multi, and Jar._### #5 Add Water Heat water to 200° F. Fill the Water Bottle to the top. Wait until all that water exits completely into the Waterspout. Then fill it again. At this point, you will have added 300 milliliters of water, which is all we need for our 10-ounce cup of coffee.![Gabi Pour Water](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/gabi-pour-water.WEq6O7xA_ZK12CG.webp)_Add hot water to Water Bottle._### #6 Remove the stack and enjoy! Once the coffee has finished brewing, remove the stack and enjoy.![Gabi Brewing Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/gabi-brewing-outside.CgyNzmZp_Z1gn30m.webp) ### The Waterspout is Pretty Cool What makes the Gabi special is the Waterspout. Instead of having a human try to gently and evenly pour water onto the coffee grounds, the waterspout handles that task. It slows the water flow into cascading drops that hit the coffee grounds evenly. As the person making the coffee, my only task, once the Gabi Drip Master stack is set up, is to add enough water to the Water bottle. Gabi does the rest. I’ve tried many different coffee pour-over devices, and this is the first time I’ve seen this part handled for me. This is what high-end automatic drip coffee makers do so well, but at a much lower price.![Gabi Waterpout underneath](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/gabi-upside-down.B_gX9td5_2aCxEL.webp)_This is a close-up view of the waterspout._  ### The Verdict When I first test a new coffee brewer, I expect the first few brews not to go smoothly, so I don’t use my best coffee. I use my worst coffee. It is better to make mistakes and throw out coffee you don’t like instead of wasting your best coffee. So, for this brewer, I used a naturally processed coffee from Indonesia that just tasted odd to me. It was bright but not sweet, with a sour finish. To my amazement, Gabi made this coffee, which was underwhelming on the AeroPress, taste magical. It was rich, sweet, and with a clean finish—no sourness. Then I pulled out my good coffee and made several more mugs of coffee. Each one was outstanding. I’m a fan of the Gabi Drip Master. When I first stacked all those sections together, I felt silly, like I was playing coffee Jenga, but the coffee speaks for itself. It tastes great. The Gabi Master is a great flat-bottom pour-over device. ### Resources [Stagg Pour-Over Coffee Dripper Review and Tutorial](https://ineedcoffee.com/stagg-pour-coffee-dripper-review-tutorial/) – Flat-bottom pour-over device.

# Make Cold Brew Coffee Quickly with the Gourmia Automatic Cold Brewer [Brewing Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/brewing-coffee/)---by [Michael Allen Smith](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/michael-allen-smith/)![Make Cold Brew Coffee Quickly with the Gourmia Automatic Cold Brewer](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/make-cold-brew-coffee-quickly-gourmia-automatic-cold-brewer/Make-Cold-Brew-Coffee-Quickly.jpg) In several tutorials here on INeedCoffee, we show you how easy it is to make cold brew coffee at home. Soak coffee grounds in water for 12-36 hours, filter, and you’re done. The only step left is to chill the finished brew. So what makes one cold brewer better than the next? Volume, the quality of the filter, how easy it is to clean up, and how good it looks on your counter. That was it. Until now. Gourmia solved the one variable everyone else took for granted: The Wait. Why must we wait 12-36 hours for cold brew coffee? Does it have to take so long? Can we speed up the process? We wait so many hours for cold-brewed coffee because the coffee grounds are sitting in motionless water, slowly releasing their flavor—very slowly. What if, throughout the brew cycle, the water gently agitated the coffee grounds to accelerate the release of flavor? You could reduce the brew time. This is what the Automatic Cold Brewer by Gourmia does. Depending on how rich you want your cold brew, the Gourmia will softly push the water evenly over the coffee grounds for 10 to 40 minutes. This is followed by an optional cooling cycle of around 6 minutes. This means that you can have filtered cold brew coffee from set up to finish in minutes.![Gourmia Automatic Cold Brewer](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/cold-brewer-kitchen-counter.DjgY-2xD_2j9J7.webp)_Gourmia Automatic Cold Brewer_### The Equipment When you unbox the Gourmia Cold Brewer, you will see several parts. Don’t be overwhelmed. It is easy to get started, and the documentation is well-written. First, you’ll want to remove all the plastic wraps covering the different sections. Then wash and dry everything.![Cold Brewer Parts ](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/cold-brewer-the-stack.BGDkZvTM_ZcHUxV.webp)_This photo shows the different parts of the Gourmia Automatic Cold Brewer.__From top to bottom: Lid, Top Filter on the Coffee Basket, Ice Basket, Pitcher, Removable Fountain (inside Pitcher), and the Main Unit. Note that the coffee basket is used only during the brew cycle, and the ice basket is used only during the chilling cycle._  ### Cold Brew or Cold Brew Concentrate? Before you start brewing, you will decide how strong you want your cold brew. There are four settings, each corresponding to a brew strength. - Light – 10 minutes - Medium – 20 minutes - Bold – 30 minutes - Concentrate – 40 minutes Gourmia recommends using a Medium-Coarse grind for all the settings. However, if you want to make a strong coffee in 10 minutes, tighten up the grind to Medium. If you’ve used a grind too fine and your coffee is too strong, you can always add water to bring the coffee to the strength level you prefer most. ### Brew Quantities Three markings on the pitcher’s side indicate different brew quantities. Each level has a different coffee requirement. This information is in the instructions, but I’ll reprint it here if you’ve misplaced yours. - 10 ounces water – 25 grams or five teaspoons of ground coffee - 16 ounces water – 40 grams or eight teaspoons of ground coffee - 24 ounces water – 60 grams or twelve teaspoons of ground coffee The brew chamber can hold a lot more water but don’t be tempted to make more than 24 ounces because the basket that holds the ground coffee is limited to around 60 grams. Adding more water will only result in a weaker brew. You can add water post-brew if it tastes too strong for you. ### Step By Step Brewing Instructions The Gourmia Automatic Cold Brewer has two phases. 1. Brewing Cycle 2. Chilling Cycle Phase two is optional. You do not need to use the brewer to perform the cooling, but if you are having the coffee right away, use it. Otherwise, bottle the coffee and place it in the frig. #### #1 Add the Removable Fountain Twist the Removable Fountain clockwise into the bottom of the pitcher before adding water. #### #2 Add Water Fill the pitcher with cold water to the marking level you wish to make. 10, 16, or 24 ounces.![Add water to Cold Brewer](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/cold-brewer-add-water.BLupcpUl_Z2kz3Ke.webp)_On this brew, I was making 16 ounces of coffee._#### #3 Add Ground Coffee to Basket Add coffee grounds inside the Coffee Basket and place it on the pitcher.![Place Coffee Basket with grounds](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/cold-brewer-add-coffee2.D3BAfoqy_XbVIu.webp)_Add coffee grounds inside the Coffee Basket and place them inside the Pitcher._  #### #4 Put on the Top Filter and Lid Put the Top Filter over the Coffee Basket and press it into place. Then, add the Lid and turn it in place.![Top Filter in place](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/cold-brewer-coer-grounds.C5kHEWFZ_Zp80dD.webp)_The Top Filter will fit snugly over the Coffee Basket._ ![Lock Lid on Cold Brewer](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/cold-brewer-secure-lid.qb4Rpkqo_Z1F4DGi.webp)_Secure the Lid on top._  #### #5 Plug in the Cold Brewer Confirm that the cold brewer is plugged into a working outlet. If you have power, you’ll see the LED Display. #### #6 Set Brew Time and Begin Pressing the left button will cycle through the brewing times in 10-minute increments. Set the time based on the brew strength you desire, and then hit the right button to begin. If you decide you want to make the coffee lighter or stronger in the middle of a brew, you can adjust the timer.![bold cold brew 30 minutes](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/cold-brewer-bold.DxtWPGDq_ZnvVA3.webp)_Here, I have set the brew to 30 minutes (Bold) with the button on the left. Then, I pressed the right button to initiate the cold brew._  At this point, the coffee has finished brewing. You can bottle it and place it in the refrigerator or if you’ve made a concentrate, you can add ice/cold water. Or heat it and drink it hot. ### (Optional) Perform Chilling Cycle The Gourmia has a chilling cycle that moves your cold brew near the basket of ice, cooling the coffee without melting the ice. The cold brew retains its brew strength and gets chilled. #### #1 Swap Coffee Filter Basket with Ice Basket Remove the Coffee Filter Basket and place it inside the Ice Basket filled with ice cubes. #### #2 Add the Top Filter Lid and Start the Chill Cycle To start the chill, hold the left button down for 3 seconds. Once you see **CH:LL**, press the right power button. This will take about 6 minutes. During this time it may appear the machine is doing nothing, but the coffee is being circulated through the Removable Fountain by the ice.![Chilling Cycle on Cold Brewer](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/cold-brew-chill.r_CRg8mJ_ZKgDt3.webp) At the end of the chilling cycle, the coffee will not be super cold, but it will be cool enough that if you add ice, the ice will not melt right away. ### Troubleshooting Add water, ice, or both if the coffee tastes too strong. If the coffee is too weak, tighten your coffee grind and/or extend the brew cycle time. ### Review The Automatic Cold Brewer by Gourmia is pretty neat. The cold brews I made at both the 20-minute and 30-minute settings were just as delicious as the cold brew I had in my frig, which took 24 hours. Besides the extreme time savings you get with the Automatic Cold Brewer, another benefit is that with the 4 settings, all the guesswork on how long to leave your cold brew is handled for you. Repeating your brewing results will be easy with the Gourmia. As much as I like other cold brewing methods, even the newer ones with better filters, I found that the Automatic Cold Brewer brews a cleaner, brighter-tasting cold brew. When it was finished brewing, there wasn’t the sandy residue at the bottom of the pot. For those who love cold brew coffee but don’t like to wait a day, this might be the coffee brewer you need. ### Resources_Gourmia GCM6800 Automatic Cold Brew Coffee Maker_[Cold Brew Coffee is Not Rocket Science](https://ineedcoffee.com/cold-brew-coffee-is-not-rocket-science/) – An overview of the basics of cold brew coffee. *Disclosure: This post was sponsored.

# Make Your Own Coffee Pods [Brewing Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/brewing-coffee/)---by [John Wolf](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/john-wolf/)![Make Your Own Coffee Pods](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/make-your-own-coffee-pods/wolfpo10.gif) Do you really like your pod coffee maker, but wish you could use your favorite brand of coffee instead of paying a premium price for a mediocre blend — just because it is shaped like a pod? Why not make your own? ### What You’ll Need Most of what you’ll need is probably already in your kitchen. Look for a stainless steel measuring scoop that fits into the pod holder on your maker. I have a Senseo brand maker and a 1/3 cup measure fits perfectly.![scoop](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/wolfpo1.Ddipsuh4_4UhpC.webp) Next, look for a jar or a glass that fits nicely into the measuring scoop. I found a vitamin jar that worked very well. Finally, see if you have any Mr. Coffee style filters that fit the really small 4 to 5 cup machine.![jar](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/wolfpo2.CJI7IUhn_10ikzT.webp) ![coffee filter](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/wolfpo3.D46q7dPd_Z11GOI5.webp) ### Test Equipment Set the jar into the scoop and then scoop into your pod holder, just to make sure everything fits together. The better they fit, the better your finished pods will be.![align jar to scoop to pod holder](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/wolfpo41.CI44z31K_2hnbg3.webp) ### Making the Pod Next, take a single Mr. Coffee styled filter and shape it evenly over the end of your jar or glass or whatever you are using. Try to center it pretty good — but it doesn’t have to be perfect. Next, invert the jar and filter, and press it into the measuring scoop. Press and spin the jar around a little bit to get a nice tight edge in the filter paper at the bottom of the measuring cup.![filter on jar](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/wolfpo5.COElITZB_gzWIW.webp) ![arrow to](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/wolfpo6.C-Z8QEgt_ZxvqPS.webp) ![invert filter in jar](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/wolfpo7.-g0kvjk3_7J91w.webp) Remove the jar, leaving a cup-shaped filter in the measuring scoop. Add one scoop or about 2 teaspoons of your favorite ground coffee to this paper-filter cup — more or less to taste. The typical coffee scoops that come with makers hold about 7 grams of coffee which is just about right. Give the cup a slight shake to evenly spread the grounds across the bottom of the filter, and then use your finger to gently fold over the extra filter material, completely covering the ground coffee.![scoop coffee into filter](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/wolfpo8.CC9RYQu5_FcWea.webp) ![arrow to](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/wolfpo6.C-Z8QEgt_ZxvqPS.webp) ![close filter](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/wolfpo9.D-SflyjO_ZpCg91.webp)![arrow to](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/wolfpo6.C-Z8QEgt_ZxvqPS.webp) ![press down](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/wolfpo10.B0pNPz0g_5k94a.webp) For a really well-formed pod, you can place the jar into the scoop one last time and press down really hard with the palm of your hand.**Be Sure To Place SMOOTH-SIDE-DOWN In Your Machine** Finally, invert the scoop and pop out your homemade pod. They cost a lot less, work just as well as the real thing and you can use your favorite coffee instead of the standard fare. I found that the best coffee to use with this method is any of the Melitta varieties because not only is the coffee excellent, but the powdery grind makes most other brands look quite coarse by comparison.![finished pod](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/wolfpo11.PGm-dxr7_weAjx.webp) ### Please Note Be careful not to use too big of a filter or to make sloppy folds. If you plug up your machine the pressure build-up will either spray hot water all over the place or will engage the safety locks which prevent the lid from being re-opened. If this happens you’ll have to wait until the pressure subsides so that the locks release and you can remove the faulty pod. Clean your pod holder frequently and check to make sure nothing is blocking the hole(s) before each brewing cycle.**UPDATE 2012:** If you have a Senseo machine, you can now purchase an Ecopad, the Refillable Coffee Filter for the Classic Senseo, or the Coffeeduck Classic: Permanent Refillable Coffee Filter for the Senseo models HD7810-HD7812 to streamline making your own coffee pods.**UPDATE 2017:** From Mandy: > The update 2012 says you can use an Ecopad or a Coffeduck.  I have a Senso Quadrante. The Ecopads and Coffeeduck won’t work in this new Senseo.  But the Ecopad can be hacked to work. 1. Use an Ecopad. 2. Discard the lid of the Ecopad. (the lid just makes the pod too tall and the Senseo top won’t close) 3. Instead, use filter paper as the lid of Ecopad.  The coffee shops near me all sell AeroPress, and the circular filter papers used in the AeroPress are just the right size to become the lid of the refillable pod.

# Make Your Own Frappuccinos at Home and Save Money [Recipes](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/coffee-recipes/)---by [Michael Hibbs](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/michael-hibbs/)![Make Your Own Frappuccinos at Home and Save Money](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/make-your-own-frappuccinos-at-home-and-save-money/homemade-frappuccinos.jpg) Would you like to save a few bucks on your beloved Starbucks Frappuccino®? Here is a step-by-step guide to different ways you can make yours at home. We will demonstrate how to make three different flavors: Vanilla, Mocha, and Caramel. ### The Basics The Frappuccino you buy at Starbucks can be challenging to emulate. This is because Starbucks uses some specialized ingredients, such as the base, to fit its brand. However, this doesn’t mean one cannot make theirs at home, which could taste as close as the signature Starbucks brew. The Frappuccino drink is based on an iced cappuccino and is sometimes topped with whipped cream. It contains espresso, coffee, whipped cream, sweeteners, and milk. In the following recipes, we use alternatives to the Frappuccino base, such as ice cream or condensed milk, to thicken and sweeten our homemade Frappuccino.![serve-caramel-frap](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/serve-caramel-frap-650x434.DoycmgbT_Z1c0pYc.webp) ### The Coffee Component Each of the drink recipes below will have a coffee component. Starbucks uses a mix of both coffee and espresso. If you have an espresso machine, by all means, use espresso. The intense flavor of espresso will hold up well against the other ingredients. If you do not have an espresso machine, you can make strong “espresso-like” shots using an AeroPress or Stovetop espresso maker. See the article [Making Lattes Without an Espresso Machine](https://ineedcoffee.com/making-lattes-without-espresso-machine/) for more details. Another option is to use instant coffee. Starbucks makes a line of instant coffees called VIA Instant. Their Italian Roast is the best option for your homemade Frappuccino, but other varietals should be fine as well. Trader Joe’s also makes a decent instant coffee. Although using instant coffee is super convenient and cheap, the downside is that it has less caffeine than espresso or brewed coffee, so your drink may be missing the kick you require. ### Recipe: Home-made Vanilla Frappuccino The first drink we are making is the classic Vanilla. - Preparation time: 5 mins - Serving: 1 - Tools: Blender, Glass #### Ingredients - 1 teaspoon Vanilla Extract - ½ cup of milk (whole milk is best) - 1 cup ice - 2 Tablespoons of honey (or syrup) - Starbucks instant coffee – we used an espresso shot instead #### ![vanilla-frap-setup](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/vanilla-frap-setup-650x433.BGRtbxbZ_1jJq1t.webp) #### Steps 1. Add the ice cubes to your glass, followed by the milk and vanilla extract. This should be an estimate for one serving. 2. Pour this into your blender and pour the contents of one Starbucks instant coffee sachet or espresso shot. 3. Add the honey. 4. For each extra serving, add an extra sachet of the Starbucks instant coffee or espresso shot, a tablespoon of vanilla extract, and a glass of the iced milk. 5. Set your blender to medium speed, then whip until the mixture is creamy or icy. 6. Serve in your glass and enjoy! #### Notes The strength of the coffee brew will determine the final taste. You need to make it strong because it will be diluted by ice, milk, and other liquids. You can always add more coffee to dial in your ideal strength level. Use whole milk and add an extra glass of ice for a thicker blend. You can also top your iced drink with whipped cream and other flavorings.![serve-vanilla-frap](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/serve-vanilla-frap-650x434.Dy7Ug0TJ_WDRC1.webp) ### Recipe: Coffee-based Home Rendition for the Starbucks Mocha Frappuccino - Serves: 1 large glass - Time: 5 Minutes #### Ingredients - 1 shot of espresso - ¾ cup of sweetened condensed milk (or more to taste or thicken) - 1 cup ice - ¾ cup of chocolate syrup - Whipped cream #### Steps 1. Combine all the ingredients except the whipped cream in a blender with the ice on top. 2. Blend on medium-low till your drink appears smooth (or the ice is fully broken). 3. Depending on the consistency or taste you want, you can pour in more condensed milk, ice, and flavorings of your choice. 4. Serve in a glass and top with the whipped cream 5. Enjoy! #### Notes You can experiment with flavorings and toppings of your choice. Dark chocolate syrup is the best choice for mocha Frappuccino ### Recipe: Crème-based Homemade Caramel Frappuccino - Prep Time: 10 Minutes - Serves: 1 #### Ingredients - Vanilla ice cream, 2 big scoops - Milk, 2/3 cup - Ice cubes, 1 cup - Caramel sauce, 1 tablespoon (or more for topping) - Caramel syrup, 3 tablespoons - Whipped cream #### ![caramel-frap](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/caramel-frap-650x434.Dg7z7niR_ZoKtrz.webp) #### Steps 1. Add milk, ice cubes, caramel syrup, 1 tablespoon of caramel sauce, and ice cream to the blender. 2. Blend for about 30 seconds and remove. It should appear smooth 3. Pour into your glass, followed by the whipped cream. 4. You can sprinkle the remaining caramel sauce on top for a breathtaking taste and beautiful appearance. ### ![add-caramel](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/add-caramel-650x434.DkuAJShq_2k2u00.webp) ### Conclusion Starbucks definitely makes some good Frappuccinos, but as we all know, they’re not very affordable, especially if you love them so much that you want to drink one every day. These three recipes make really great copycat drinks for a fraction of the price. We’re even sure that most of you already have these ingredients at home. The taste is amazing, customization variations are endless, and preparing one of these really doesn’t take a lot of time. Pour them into a to-go cup or tumbler and spell your name wrong on it, and you won’t even notice it’s not Starbucks!

# Making a Delicious Cup of Coffee [Brewing Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/brewing-coffee/)---by [Alton Brown](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/alton-brown/)![Making a Delicious Cup of Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/making-a-delicious-cup-of-coffee/delicious-coffee1.jpg) Making a delicious cup of coffee is easy if you start with the best beans and follow some simple guidelines.![Delicious Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/delicious-coffee1.DsDk1qpY_Z1wsIBN.webp)_Delicious Coffee_ To help you avoid some common coffee-making pitfalls, Alton Brown offers these tips: 1. Always start with fresh, cool water.  1.     - Do use fresh spring or tap water    - Do use clean water with no detectable tastes or odors    - Don’t use demineralized water, such as distilled water, which lacks the necessary level of dissolved mineral solids (100-200 ppm) needed to give the water that “crystal fresh” taste2. Brew with high-quality beans. 3. Do use freshly ground beans before brewing to release their fragrant aromatics 4. Do store your coffee beans in an airtight container away from light 5. Don’t let your beans absorb moisture in the refrigerator or freezer because this hastens staling 6. Preparing coffee in a French Press is easy and fun. 7. Do preheat the glass pot before brewing 8. Do brew with fresh clean water just off the boil 9. Do fill the pot, then give it a quick stir. Cover with the plunger lid, allow the brew to infuse for four minutes, then gently depress the plunger through the grounds for 30 seconds 10. Don’t leave the coffee in the press after brewing – pour it into an insulated carafe, so it doesn’t get cold or bitter 11. Don’t ever re-use coffee grounds, because their desirable, dissolvable flavor solids were extracted during the first brewing 12. The proper coffee-to-water ratio makes all the difference 13. Do use 2 tablespoons of ground coffee per six ounces of water 14. Don’t try to make “weaker coffee” by decreasing the amount of coffee you use to brew. This only results in a bitter, over-extracted beverage. Instead, just add a little water to your cup and you will be able to enjoy a less intense, but still high-quality coffee flavor Published on April 3, 2004--- #### Alton Brown [Follow Alton Brown on X](https://x.com/altonbrown)Alton Brown is the host and star of TV’s Good Eats.

# Make Your Own Genmaicha Tea [Tea](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/tea/)---by [Michael Allen Smith](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/michael-allen-smith/)![Make Your Own Genmaicha Tea](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/make-your-own-genmaicha-tea/genmaicha-tea-blend.jpg) I’m a coffee drinker who also loves tea. When I chat with other coffee drinkers, they often don’t share my love for tea. One of the big reasons, I believe, is that often, their only experience is with low-grade bagged tea or that dreadful Genmaicha tea served at many sushi restaurants. In a future article, I’ll extend my hand and guide the coffee enthusiast into the world of quality loose-leaf tea. For this post, I’m just going to tackle Genmaicha. Genmaicha tea is a Japanese green tea blended with toasted brown rice. The history of the tea is that poor families added rice to stretch out the tea and save money. I believe the toasted rice also serves a secondary function, and that is to cover up defects in the tea itself. The most common defect is staleness. Earlier this year, if you had asked me what my least favorite tea was, I would have said Genmaicha. Then, I challenged my assumptions. What if I made my own at home and got each step right? Would it be enjoyable? Now I know some people who like the Genmaicha tea served at restaurants—good for you. However, I think it is nasty and can be greatly improved when you make your own. I’ve discovered four reasons why Genmaicha tea can taste awful. 1. Low-grade or stale tea. 2. Too much rice. Stale rice? 3. Brewed at too high of a temperature. 4. Steeped too long. ### Source Fresh Bancha Tea Bancha is a Japanese green tea that comes from the same tree as sencha. It is harvested later and has a lower market price. When I started this experiment, I first chose Sencha tea. Many Genmaicha blends use sencha, but in my tests, I preferred bancha. Sencha tastes wonderful by itself, whereas I felt the Bancha complimented the toasted rice better.![bancha tea](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/bancha-tea1.y0KreSXA_Z1Ig0I4.webp)_Bancha Tea_ Low-grade tea is often used to make Genmaicha, and some producers know that the toasted rice flavor can cover up defects or staleness, so be sure to find a fresh source of Bancha tea. Many tea enthusiasts say Japanese green tea has a maximum shelf life of just 6 months. Other teas, such as oolongs and black teas, can last longer. ### Toast Your Rice Get out a skillet and place the heat on medium-high. Pour out a few tablespoons of brown rice. It will get toasty brown, and some grains might even pop into what appears to be popcorn. Genmaicha is sometimes called popcorn tea. That “popcorn” isn’t corn. It comes from heating the brown rice. To prevent burning, I pulled most of the rice once it got a toasty look to it. Then, I returned some rice to the skillet and cooked a little longer until the grains started popping. Afterward, I post-blended the popped rice with the unpopped rice.![Toasted Brown Rice](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/toasted-brown-rice._mv2fFAx_tp4g7.webp)_Toasted Brown Rice_ Once you have your supply of toasted rice, you can add as much or as little as you like. I use just under one teaspoon for a single 14-ounce mug. I get the toasty flavor and can still appreciate the brightness of the tea. I keep my toasted rice in a sealed container. I don’t know how long it will stay fresh past roasting, so I only toast what I’ll need for the next few weeks. ### Brewing Method Japanese green tea is the most sensitive tea to heat. You want a lower temperature. I use the range of 165-175F. Use a kettle that allows you to enter the exact temperature you wish to heat your water and then shuts off when it hits that temperature. The standard brewing ratio for tea is 3 grams for every 8 ounces of water. In addition to using a lower temperature, the steep time will be shorter. About 90 seconds is all you need. The tea becomes more bitter when you brew it at a higher temperature or steep it longer. My brewing parameters can be tweaked to your liking. I have found that the lower temperature and steep time allow me to get an additional one or two steeps, whereas a longer steep or higher temperature may only yield a single good cup of tea.![Genmaicha Tea Blend](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/genmaicha-tea-blend.CyUGdWGQ_279upz.webp)_Homemade Genmaicha Tea_### A Good Genmaicha? Two months ago I couldn’t stand Genmaicha tea. Now I am a fan. Not the swill they serve at sushi places, but the stuff I make at home. It is super easy to make. Give it a try and if you want to make it even better you can add a little powdered matcha, but that is optional.

# Making Coffee Soap [Cafe Culture](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/cafe-culture/)---by [Lura Lee](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/lura-lee/)![Making Coffee Soap](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/making-coffee-soap/pile-of-coffee-soap-550.jpg) This tutorial shows you how to make coffee soap, which is a delightful gift to add to a coffee gift basket, and it’s one way to recycle some used coffee grounds. It’s not too hard, but making soap from scratch isn’t child’s play, either. Hard soap requires lye, which is a poisonous, caustic substance. The other drawback is that it’s several weeks before you can use the soap. The neat part about this soap is that it is not too feminine; it’s a unisex bar of soap that is mild — perfect for the kitchen. The addition of coffee grounds at the trace stage can turn this bar of soap into a heavy-duty soap, good for scrubbing your hands after working in the backyard.![Coffee Soap](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/coffee-soap1.DEMswMnr_1wHiEz.webp)_Coffee Soap by Linda Banning_### Supplies Needed to Make Coffee Soap - Pam cooking spray - 8 oz soybean oil - 8 oz coconut oil (on sale in your nearest health food store) - 8 oz olive oil (do not use extra-virgin; use the low-grade, cheap stuff) - 2.25 oz lye - 7 oz of double-strength coffee. (The coffee doesn’t have to taste good, so you can reuse grounds or mix different types) - 2 tablespoons extra coffee grounds in case you want to add them later - 1 oz Coffee Fragrance Oil for soap and candles **Optional** (You can buy coffee-scented oil over the internet) - 2 medium-sized enamel or stainless steel pots (never use aluminum) - Soap molds (store-bought molds, shoe box lined with freezer paper, a small pan, small plastic containers, or a capped PVC pipe) - Cooking thermometer - Blender - Saran wrap - Old Blanket or insulated pouch - Yellow kitchen gloves - Safety glasses - A long sleeve shirt Start off with at least 14 oz of distilled or filtered water (try not to use tap water as the minerals may affect the soap chemistry). Make the coffee by any method (vac pot or drip coffee works well.) When the coffee is done, place it in the refrigerator to chill. Expect some water evaporation. Grease the mold(s) by spraying Pam cooking spray liberally over the entire surface. Change into your lye working clothes: put on a long-sleeve shirt, safety glasses, and yellow gloves. Lye is very dangerous stuff and should only be handled with caution, in a very well-ventilated location. Keep your long-sleeve shirt on, and the gloves and safety glasses handy until the soap mixture is in the molds. Getting this mixture on the skin irritates the skin and can cause a burning sensation, along with welts on the skin. If this happens, follow the instructions for handling emergencies provided on the container of lye.![Lye Protection](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/lye_protection_150x119.CBXX9ibM_Z1TUTNT.webp)_Lye Protection_ Measure exactly 2.25 oz of lye; no more, no less. In a well-ventilated area, pour the chilled coffee into a medium-sized bowl. Slowly pour in the lye. The lye will get very hot and will emit caustic fumes that should not be inhaled if it can be avoided. Set the lye aside in an area that is safely away from children and pets. In a medium-sized bowl, pour in the soybean and olive oils, then scoop in the coconut oil. Slowly heat the oils to between 100 and 110 degrees. All of the oil should be in a liquid state by this point. Remove the oil from the heat. Check to ensure that the lye/coffee mixture has cooled to between 100 and 110 degrees or lower. You must be wearing your protective clothing for this stage. Pour the lye mixture into the oil mixture, being careful not to splatter.![Lye and oils mixed](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/lye_oil_150x184.DbFt_c3T_Z19xcr5.webp)_Lye and oils mixed_### Stir, then Blend Stir this mixture continuously for a few minutes. At this point, you may decide to put the mixture in a blender. This is not a mandatory step. Blending the soap in the blender will help the mixture get to the “trace” stage quicker (in 15 minutes instead of 2.5 hours), but it is not inherently better soap. Make sure not to splatter the mixture in the process of transferring it to the blender. Cover the blender with a lid and an extra towel to ensure that none of this very potent mixture gets out. Blend at the lowest settings only and expect the mixture to burp, meaning that air will get caught and a bubble will form and burst. You don’t want the mixture to burp in your eyes or face, so be very cautious about how you handle this mixture and continue wearing protective clothing.![Lye and coffee mixed](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/lye_coffee_150x200.ClATR1ml_14kzsz.webp)_Lye and coffee mixed_ Do not keep the blender on continuously. Turn it off and on (on for one minute, off for 2, or so.) You want the soap mixture to cool slowly. Too much blending defeats the purpose of heating up the mixture.![soap blender](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/blender_soap_150x178.BcAgKoM3_Z1g39JF.webp) If you blend by hand, you don’t have to blend continuously for 2.5 hours. Stir the mixture for about a minute in 15-20 minute intervals. ### Tracing There is a stage in soap making called the “trace” stage. This stage is when the mixture thickens enough that you can take a spoonful of mixture and drip it onto a bowl and it will stay thick enough to leave a trace where it was dripped along the bowl. Soaps generally trace sometime between 15 minutes and 3 hours. When I did not use the blender, this particular soap recipe reached the trace stage in about 2.5 hours. When I used the blender, the soap traced within 20 minutes. ### Adding Fragrance If you want to add fragrance or coffee grounds, you can add them at the trace stage, either by blending or stirring them in. I used 1 ounce of a coffee candle and soap fragrance oil. If you want to change the color of your soap, you can add about a quarter of a brown Crayola crayon. The crayon has to be made with stearic acid; most crayons are made this way. Since I didn’t add any color, but the coffee added some color, the soap at this stage is a light caramel color. ### Pouring the soap Pour the soap into the soap molds. You may also decide to add stuff at this point in the soap-making process. In one soap mold, I added some coffee grounds to what would become the bottom of a bar of soap. After you fill the molds, place saran wrap over the top of the molds. Lift up the molds, then gently tap each soap reservoir to make sure there are no air bubbles. ### Insulate You don’t want your soap to cool off too quickly. Place the wrapped soap molds in an insulated container or wrap them with a big blanket. Don’t disturb the soap for 1 to 2 days.![Insulate the soap](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/insulate_150x200.BS_BaYen_Z1D4mbB.webp)_Insulate the soap_ After a couple of days, you can pop the soap out of the mold. If you need to cut the soap into individual pieces, this is the time to do it because it will be too hard to do later. Place the soap on a paper plate and set it in a cool, dry, dark place for 3 weeks.![Pop the soap!](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/popped_150x153.DDT_CsNe_1tUdgO.webp)_Pop the soap!_ After 3 weeks, the soap will be ready to use. This soap produces a fairly rich lather.![coffee soaps](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/pile-of-coffee-soap-550.CXqCQJtM_ZTVcKi.webp)_Coffee Soaps by Linda Banning_### FAQ_Why does it have to be in a cool, dark, dry place for 3 weeks?_ It takes three weeks for the water to evaporate._If I use freshly brewed coffee, will the soap smell more like coffee without the addition of the oil?_ No, I don’t think that has an effect. The actual coffee doesn’t scent the soap – – only the oil scents the soap. The coffee will make the soap a caramel color, and if you add coffee grounds at the trace stage the coffee will make the soap a heavy-duty soap. However, if you want a darker brown color to the soap you’ll need to use the crayon._And finally, would you feel safe giving it as a gift even with the lye in it? Could it hurt someone? Should there be special instructions enclosed with the gift?_ ALL hard soaps are made with lye. That’s how soap is made. According to Merin at _Soap-Junkie.com_ (MAY 2011: site down), the saponification process (neutralization of the lye and turning the oils/lye combo into soap) takes 72 hours. During this time, contact with the skin should be avoided. After this amount of time, the soap is safe. However, the soap needs three weeks to harden fully; if it is too moist when used, it will dissolve away in no time._Thank you to Linda Banning for the updated photos.

# Making Cold Brew Coffee in a French Press [Brewing Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/brewing-coffee/)---by [Michael Allen Smith](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/michael-allen-smith/)![Making Cold Brew Coffee in a French Press](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/making-cold-brew-coffee-french-press/french-press-cold-brew.jpg) Here on INeedCoffee, we have several coffee brewing tutorials for making cold brew coffee. You can buy a [Primula](https://ineedcoffee.com/making-cold-brew-coffee-with-the-primula-coffee-maker/), a [Toddy](https://ineedcoffee.com/cold-brew-coffee-with-the-toddy-coffee-maker/), or a [cold brew filter pouch](https://ineedcoffee.com/cold-brew-coffee-is-not-rocket-science/). Or maybe you don’t need a dedicated coffee brewer at all. That is what we decided to find out. We wanted to repurpose one of our existing brewers to make cold brew coffee. The perfect choice was the French Press. For this article, we are using a 34-ounce French Press. The model we used is no longer available for sale, but other models should work the same. The basics of cold-brew coffee are explained in the article [Cold Brew Coffee is Not Rocket Science](https://ineedcoffee.com/cold-brew-coffee-is-not-rocket-science/). Let water steep over coffee grounds at room temperature for 12+ hours then filter and serve. Let’s get brewing. ### #1 Measure Coffee How much coffee should you use? The answer to this question will vary depending on whom you ask. The short answer is more than you would for regular brewed coffee. If you do not want to deal with math or scales, just double the amount of the coffee you normally use when making hot French Press coffee. If you want to jump into the math, read on; otherwise, skip to Step #2. In our [French Press tutorial](https://ineedcoffee.com/press-pot-tutorial/), we use a 17 to 1 ratio, which means 17 parts water to 1 part coffee. The advice for cold brew is to use between 3 to 1 and 7 to 1. Due to volume limitations, we found a 7 to 1 ratio ideal for the French Press. If you find 7 to 1 is not strong enough, I would extend the brew time by a few hours instead of adding more coffee. The sizes of French Press brewers are an interesting topic. The size listed on the box, how much liquid it holds, filled to the very top, and then the estimated coffee yield when you brew it. Seattle Coffee Gear comprehensively tested these numbers in the post [Coffee Presses: Overall Volume vs. Actual Yield](https://web.archive.org/web/20131215050955/http://www.seattlecoffeegear.com:80/learn/coffee-101/articles/coffee-press-yields). When you scan this chart, you notice that the actual yield of brewed coffee is always a few ounces less than the volume listed on the box. The difference is the coffee grounds and the amount of water lost. The more coffee added to a French Press, the more space the coffee occupies and the more water is trapped in the grounds at the end of a brewing cycle. As shown in the Seattle Coffee Gear article, we can expect to lose a few ounces when we use a regular hot French Press. We will lose more for cold brew, so using a large French Press to make cold brew coffee is advised. Smaller French Presses might not be worth the hassle because they yield so little. And unlike a hot French Press, we aren’t ready to brew again in 4 minutes. We are waiting for another 12 hours. For these tests, we used a 34-ounce French Press. For easy math, I’m going to round this to 1000 grams. I did three brew cycles, each at a different strength ratio. I aimed to keep the brew weights close and not fill it to the very top. 1. **Regular 17 to 1:**  809 grams water + 48 grams ground coffee = 857 grams brew weight. Brew Yield = 733 grams (or 26 ounces) 2. **Strong 12 to 1:** 800 grams water + 67 grams ground coffee = 867 grams brew weight. Brew Yield = 686 grams (or 24 ounces) 3. **Cold 7 to 1:** 756 grams water + 107 grams ground coffee = 864 grams brew weight. Brew Yield = 588 grams (or 21 ounces) As you can see, as we increase the strength of the brewing ratio, coffee yield declines. Using the same math, we would expect a 20-ounce French Press to yield 13.5 ounces of cold brew. ### #2 Grind Coffee You can use a medium to coarse grind when brewing cold brew coffee in a French Press. We used a coarser grind, but either will work. If you find the coarse ground cold brew too weak, tighten up your grind. If the medium grind is too strong, add more water or loosen up the grind. See our [Coffee Grind Chart](https://ineedcoffee.com/coffee-grind-chart/) for the range between Medium Coarse and Extra Coarse. ### #3 Add Ground Coffee and Water to French Press Just like you would for a regular French Press, add the ground coffee to the bottom of the brewer. Only this time, instead of hot water, you will add room-temperature or cold water. Filtered water is ideal.![add-grinds](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/add-grinds.C2i6KX7O_ZW1yq6.webp)_For this brew, we went Extra Coarse. Your grind does not need to be this coarse._ ![add-water](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/add-water.BDLjVPwn_Z2a4bo2.webp)_Add room temperature water._### #4 Gently and Slowly Stir You want to ensure all the coffee grounds are in contact with water. Stir the coffee slowly, trying to cover as much ground with water as possible.![stir-coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/stir-coffee.9GCbWu37_Z1xvBaD.webp)_Gently stir the coffee._### #5 Cover and Set Aside for 12+ hours You can cover the French Press however you like. A small plate or plastic wrap are two ideas. You could use the French Press filter; just make sure you press down only enough to hold it in place. You do not want to press the filter down until the brew is finished, which is still 12+ hours away. There is a debate about cold-brew the coffee on the counter or in the refrigerator. Either is fine. I prefer the counter because it brews faster, meaning I can, if I need to, cut the brew cycle short by an hour. However, if I were going to be away for much longer than 12 hours, I’d brew it in the refrigerator.![stir-coffee-2](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/stir-coffee-2.Ccf0ZBi8_2hz1fu.webp)_Peeking at the cold brew before pressing the filter down._  ### #6 End Brew and Serve This trick also works great for a regular French Press. By SLOWLY pushing the plunger down, you get a cleaner-tasting French Press. Strive for a 30-second plunge. You can transfer the coffee to a mason jar for storage or serve it up. Not every grinder is awesome, so you might have some fine coffee particles that make it into your cup. If you experience this, you can filter the coffee again. Place a paper coffee filter over a jar and slowly pour the coffee. This will catch any loose grounds.![pour-coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/pour-coffee.o1Vxh_Zy_ARIkn.webp)_You can pour it into your spare French Press as well._  ### #7 Clean Up The clean-up for cold-brew French Press is the same as for regular-brew French Press. You can put the grounds in compost or save them for [your garden](https://ineedcoffee.com/top-3-ways-to-re-use-your-coffee-grounds/). ### Last Words If you have limited space for your coffee gear, it is good to know that the French Press can do double duty as both a hot and a cold coffee brewer. But honestly, I found the yield not to be worth the effort, and the cleanup was more work than that of a dedicated cold brewer. If you have space and the budget for a cold brewer, check out the [Penguin](https://ineedcoffee.com/make-concentrated-cold-brew-coffee-with-the-penguin-coffee/). ### Resources [Make Concentrated Cold Brew Coffee With the Penguin Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/make-concentrated-cold-brew-coffee-with-the-penguin-coffee/) – INeedCoffee tutorial on a dedicated cold brewer.

# Making Coffee With the Cowboy Joe Coffee Brewer [Brewing Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/brewing-coffee/)---by [Michael Allen Smith](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/michael-allen-smith/)![Making Coffee With the Cowboy Joe Coffee Brewer](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/making-coffee-with-the-cowboy-joe-coffee-brewer/cowboy-joe-brewer.jpg) I recently had the opportunity to test out the Cowboy Joe Coffee Brewer. The Cowboy Joe is a single-cup plastic coffee brewer with a hole in the bottom that takes a standard 8-12 cup basket coffee filter. A plastic plug is placed inside a drain hole to allow the coffee to steep. Once the brew is complete, the plug is removed, and the coffee exits directly into the mug. The lightweight and small size of the Cowboy Joe Coffee brewer makes it a candidate for traveling and camping. Unlike a French press or other brewers, there is no risk of breakage. The only concern I see is losing the plug. One idea I had was to add a little piece of bright-colored reflective tape to the plug so it would stand out more. And to keep the plug from running away from the brewer, you could use a string to tie it to the hole on the lip of the Cowboy Joe. ### #1 Place Plug Into the Drain Hole I place the plug handle parallel to the ridges in the bottom of the brewer and then turn it one quarter or 90 degrees. This locks the plug into place.![cowboy-joe](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/cowboy-joe.BtJsgE8N_Z3tA26.webp) ### #2 Add the Coffee Filter and Ground Coffee Place the basket filter into the Cowboy Joe. As the photo below shows, the filter ridges go around the plug. Place the brewer over a mug. A tip I got from the Cowboy Joe website is to not use a mug that is too narrow as it can become _tippy_ and is at greater risk of falling over should you bump it. Also, you want to have a mug that holds enough volume to both capture the brewed coffee and allows you to add additional water and or cream. The majority of mugs are fine.![cowboy-joe-filter](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/cowboy-joe-filter.WKmKgKki_ZFVdLu.webp) Since the Cowboy Joe is small, there are two approaches you can take to brewing a cup of coffee. 1. Brew a small 8 oz cup of coffee. 2. Brew a more concentrated cup and then add water. Option #1 wasn’t for me. I’d rather have more coffee. To make the coffee more concentrated, you can either increase the dose or the steep time. I decided to use the higher dose. Now, in other coffee brewing tutorials, we pull out the scale and weigh by grams to get the 17 to 1 ratio (water to coffee), but since this brewer is likely to be used when traveling, I will keep it simple. For a single brew, I used my trusty coffee can scoop, which I’ve had for over a decade.![coffee scoop](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/scoop.CqYrJKEh_1iBuc6.webp)_1.5 scoops is about 15 grams of coffee. Start there. I got good results using a basic [drip coffee grind](https://ineedcoffee.com/coffee-grind-chart/)._### #3 Add Hot Water and Stir Bring water to a boil, wait 10-30 seconds, and then pour slowly until the water line reaches about 1/2 inch below the top of the brewer. I like to use the pour to ensure all the ground coffee is in contact with the water. If, after the pour, you see clumps of dry coffee, give a gentle stir.![cowboy-joe-steep](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/cowboy-joe-steep.huiveFGY_Z1V5dXb.webp)_Steep the coffee for 3-4 minutes._### #4 Remove the Plug, Wait, and Tilt The coffee is done brewing. Hold the brewer with one hand, then turn the plug and remove it. The coffee will begin draining into your mug. Once you can see the grounds, tilt the brewer so the side where you removed the plug is lower. This will allow the last bit of coffee to drain into your mug. ### #4 Add Water to Taste At this point, I add an ounce or two of hot water, just like I do for the [Aeropress](https://ineedcoffee.com/upside-aeropress-coffee-brewing-tutorial/). This is optional. Experiment. ### Comparisons to Clever Dripper and Melitta Pour Over At first glance, the Cowboy Joe is similar to the Clever Coffee Dripper and the 1-cup version of the Melitta Pour-Over. Like both, the brewer is placed directly over the mug. The Cowboy Joe and the Clever are full immersion coffee brewing, in that you control the steeping time, whereas the coffee immediately begins to exit with the Melitta. The standard Clever is larger and can brew more coffee at once, which means it takes up more space and is more at risk for damage when traveling.![clever-and-cowboy-joe](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/clever-and-cowboy-joe.Diby9VHY_ASjD7.webp)_The Clever Coffee Dripper (L) and the Cowboy Joe Coffee Brewer (R)._ The Cowboy Joe, like the Melitta, is dishwasher safe. Just use the top rack. The Clever is not. The Cowboy Joe and the Melitta do not have any parts that can go bad. Although it has not happened to my Clever, there are reports that the parts that initiate the seal with the Clever get stuck after a lot of use. As Chris Arnold pointed out in the [Clever Coffee Dripper Review](https://ineedcoffee.com/clever-coffee-dripper-review/), some mug sizes don’t work for the Clever. This is not an issue for the Cowboy Joe, as the coffee is released when the plug is removed from the drain hole and doesn’t require a seal mechanism to be engaged. The Clever also has a lid to keep heat in during the brew. The Cowboy Joe doesn’t, but I’ve never once used the lid, so I don’t consider it a loss. However, if you were making coffee outdoors at a cold campsite, you might want to place something over the top during the 3-4 minute brew cycle to hold the heat in. Which is best? That will depend on your needs. What is most important to you? Volume, durability, portability, or price? They all do a fine job of brewing. On my next trip, I will be leaving my Clever at home and taking the Cowboy Joe with ### Resources_Cowboy Joe Single Cup Direct Immersion Coffee Brewer_[Coffee Brewing Guide](https://ineedcoffee.com/coffee-brewing-guide/) – Our collection of coffee brewing tutorials.

# Making Bulletproof Coffee [Recipes](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/coffee-recipes/)---by [Chris Arnold](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/chris-arnold/)![Making Bulletproof Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/making-bulletproof-coffee/coconut-oil.jpg) The term Bulletproof Coffee was originally coined by Dave Asprey, founder of the website The Bulletproof Exec. His original recipe is based on yak butter tea he drank in Tibet. What is it exactly? Well, there are several variations, but it generally consists of hot coffee, MCT oil, and unsalted grass-fed butter. The ingredients are then put into a blender, and the result is a creamy, robust concoction that tastes a lot like an unsweetened latte. Note that although wet-processed coffees are recommended due to lower levels of mycotoxins (mold), I roast my own coffee, some of which are dry-processed and said to have much higher levels of mycotoxins. I generally prefer dry-processed (aka natural) coffees for flavor reasons, and dry-processed coffees have never affected me in any discernible way. For Bulletproof Coffee, I have tried everything from dry-processed Ethiopian Harrar coffee to wet-processed Brazilian coffee; flavor-wise, they all work well. There are many who dispute that mycotoxins are a problem or even exist in harmful quantities in coffee. Podcaster Joe Rogan did a show where he tested random coffee for mycotoxins and found none. The article _Dave Asprey- A 21st Century Snake Oil Salesman_ describes how trace amounts of _Ochratoxin A_ can be found in _almost everything we eat, and the body can process_ some before it causes health damage. How much? The article quotes health researcher Alan Aragon, who ran the numbers: > Under the FAO and WHO guidelines, a 80kg male could safely ingest 8000ng per week of Ochratoxin A, or 1142ng/day, before worrying about adverse health problems- that’s the equivalent of 36.8 cups of coffee, or 129.7 espresso shots. The article also goes after the fat loss claims. But enough about the health claims, this article is about making a delicious coffee beverage, back to the recipe.![Espresso Shots](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/espresso-shots.Bgs1Ivc-_Z1z6Yyf.webp) ### My Bulletproof Coffee Recipe - 1 Tbsp Organic Coconut Oil - 1 Tbsp Unsalted Grass-fed Butter (Kerrygold is good) - 2 Double Shots of Espresso + 12 Ounces of Hot Water (just below boiling) - OR or 14 ounces of brewed drip coffee Put the above in a blender for 30 seconds. I used a BlendTec, and the results are a well-mixed, frothy, and creamy result. I drink it out of a large latte mug.![Kerrygold Butter](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/kerrygold-butter.qnOk_zMo_ZbJzbB.webp)![Coconut Oil](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/coconut-oil.CWhtMRJM_gneDl.webp)![Blendtec Blender](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/blendtec-blender.6DkruPFx_28Wvgo.webp) If you want to ensure the hottest result possible, you can preheat the blender container, coffee cup, or mug and even melt the butter beforehand. ### Results Normally, when I have a triple espresso in the morning, my mind is very alert, but my body is still waking up. With the addition of coconut oil and butter, both my body and mind quickly feel energized; in other words, I am not struggling with whether to go back to bed or stay up. Even though it is recommended not to use salted butter when I initially tried Bulletproof Coffee, I only had the salted version of Kerrygold butter, so I tried it. It tasted great. I then followed up with the unsalted version, and honestly, I could not tell the difference. It might be because the amount of butter I use is relatively low compared to some other recipes I have seen. The first day, it made me a little sick to my stomach, so I reduced the amount of coconut oil and butter and just built up to the amounts listed above. Some folks use a lot more of each, though I am sticking with these ratios for now. If you use MCT oil in your recipe, gradually increase the dosage to allow your body time to process it. The standard advice is to start with 1/2 teaspoon a day and work up from there.![Bulletproof Coffee Served](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/bulletproof-coffee-served.B7Ueim6z_o3lAJ.webp) Bulletproof Coffee lends itself well to a low-carb and/or high-fat diet. ### Conclusion This Bulletproof Coffee Recipe might sound weird, but I think you will be pleasantly surprised by the flavor and how you feel if you just give it a try. ### Resources [Better Than Bulletproof Coffee](https://criticalmas.org/2012/06/better-than-bulletproof-coffee/) – Blog post by INeedCoffee founder that shows home coffee roasters how to select beans for their own BP Coffee.

# Making Cold Brew Coffee With the Primula Coffee Maker [Brewing Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/brewing-coffee/)---by [Michael Allen Smith](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/michael-allen-smith/)![Making Cold Brew Coffee With the Primula Coffee Maker](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/making-cold-brew-coffee-with-the-primula-coffee-maker/ColdBrewCoffee-PrimulaCoffee.jpg) Cold-brew coffee continues to surge in popularity. Most coffee shops offer cold-brew options, but you don’t need to spend a lot of money in the cafes because making cold-brew coffee at home is easy. Save your cafe money for espresso-based drinks. In this tutorial, we will make a pitcher of cold brew coffee using the _Primula Cold Brew Glass Carafe Iced Coffee Maker_. Although they call it an iced coffee maker, it is not. Iced coffee is coffee brewed at normal hot temperatures and then chilled. It can even be brewed directly over ice. The Primula is a cold coffee brewer, as it is brewed with cold water, takes 12-24 hours to brew, and makes a concentrate. Primula also makes a slick travel coffee brewer, which we will cover in a [separate tutorial](https://ineedcoffee.com/the-perfect-solution-for-cold-brew-coffee-on-the-go/). The filter is referred to as the Cold Brew Core in the instructions. ### #1 Grind Coffee The directions say to use 8 ounces of coarsely ground coffee. In our brewing tests, we discovered two things. First, we discovered that there was too much coffee. The coffee filter would not hold that much coffee. Also, you do not want to completely fill the filter with ground coffee, as you will be adding water. When the water hits the freshly ground coffee, it can swell and spill over the top of the filter, making a mess. Add enough ground coffee so there is at least a 2-inch (5 cm) gap between the ground coffee and the top of the filter. This works out to 6-7 ounces (by volume) of ground coffee. But instead of measuring the coffee with a scale or measuring cup, just use the actual filter. Fill it with whole bean coffee until you reach that 2-inch gap. Then remove the beans, grind them, and return them to the filter. If the coffee is already ground, just pour the ground coffee into the filter. Our initial tests supported using a coarse grind, but as we brewed more with the Primula, we began favoring a more medium grind. A good starting rule would be to use a medium grind if you plan on brewing at the low end (12 hours) and a coarser grind if you go a full day. Experiment.![cold coffee brewer - grind coffee - primula](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/cold-brewer-grind-coffee-1-608x650.C2zlXg7W_MSoBO.webp)_Eight ounces ended up being too much coffee for the filter._### #2 Add Coffee to Filter As stated above, do not overfill the filter. There is enough room between the edge of the filter and the edge of the carafe for coffee to spill out over the filter. ### #3 Place Filter in Carafe and Slowly Add Water Fill the carafe with water by slowly pouring cold water over the coffee grounds. Pouring slowly is important because you don’t want the grounds on top to float up and escape the filter. That would create a mess, and coffee grounds would slip into the brewed coffee. Once the water is in the carafe, stir using a long spoon. This optional step will ensure that all the ground coffee is in contact with the water. Once the lid is secured, you can also do a gentle rocking motion. Set the spoon attachment aside for now and secure the lid.![insert filter into primula cold coffee brewer](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/cold-brewer-prepare-526x650.BB8-v3K2_jB07u.webp) ### #4 Brew For 12-24 Hours You can brew the coffee on the counter or in the refrigerator. I prefer the counter. Brew for 12-24 hours. You can gently rock the brewer to ensure water is making contact with all the ground coffee, especially if you use a medium grind.![allow time for cold coffee to brew in primula ](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/cold-brewer-brewing-551x650.CXSMcXdL_ZQ4Imr.webp) ### #5 Remove Filter and Add Spoon Attachment (optional) After 12-24 hours have passed, the coffee has finished brewing. Remove the filter. The Primula has a spoon attachment that acts as a built-in stirrer that fits below the lid. You may decide to use it, especially if you make those fancy drink recipes included in the directions. Besides the fancy drinks, Primula has informed me that the mixer serves to aerate the coffee prior to serving. If you don’t want to use the spoon attachment, you could just use your own wooden spoon. It’s your call.![remove filter when cold coffee completes brew](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/cold-brewer-finished-489x650.C1OMT2c-_v4HOP.webp) ### #6 Add Water and Serve You now have a cold coffee concentrate that you will keep inside the refrigerator for two weeks. Unless you like a really strong coffee, you will want to add water (or milk). The directions recommend **three parts water to one part coffee**. We found that ratio will make a clean, delicious cup of coffee that is neither too strong nor too weak when brewed for 24 hours. For 12 hours, we used either less water or none at all. We advise sipping the concentrate and gradually adding water to match what you like best. ### Better Than the Toddy A few years ago, I did a tutorial on the Toddy Brewer. It did a fine job, but I prefer the Primula for a few reasons. The Primula is much easier to clean up. Just pull the filter up, empty, and rinse. The Primula also uses a permanent gold filter, so there is no need to buy replacement filters. The Toddy can brew more coffee at once, but the Primula makes enough unless you go through a lot of coffee. ### Resources [Make Concentrated Cold Brew Coffee With the Penguin Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/make-concentrated-cold-brew-coffee-with-the-penguin-coffee/) – Another cold brew option.

# Making Green Bean Extract Beverages at Home [Recipes](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/coffee-recipes/)---by [Len Brault](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/len-brault/)![Making Green Bean Extract Beverages at Home](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/making-green-bean-extract-beverages-at-home/making-green-coffee-extract.jpg) In the Brave New World of green coffee beverages, a topic that did not really exist just 5 years ago, it’s hard to find good information, techniques, and recipes. Plus a lot of what exists has been posted by people who prepare green bean extract for health reasons and seem to believe that if it doesn’t taste bad, it must not be good for you. Recent articles cite stunning research results showing that the “silver skin” of the coffee bean (the paper-like outer coating of the bean, sometimes called the chaff) can contain antioxidants 500 times more powerful than Vitamin C1 [2]. These compounds become more active with the application of moderate heat, reaching a high level by simply boiling green beans in water. Other research shows that green coffee beans have a high concentration of Chlorogenic Acid or CGA, which can accelerate fat metabolism and aid in losing excess weight [3]. This makes the idea of making green bean beverages very attractive from a health-promoting standpoint. But can this be easy, fun, and delicious? We think so! Here is a practical guide to help you on your way. ### Understanding Green Coffee Beans Coffee beans are actually seeds, and as many seeds, they are highly complex biologically. Coffee is so complex that over 40 substances are responsible for the basic taste of coffee, and there are 120+ perceptible flavor elements. Moreover, coffee is called a “polyphasic” substance. It changes constantly in every stage from “new crop” green to “rested” green, through roasting and resting after roasting, and even during the 15 minutes it sits in your cup after brewing. A listing and description of the number of active processes taking place can fill a small encyclopedia. So first, be aware that in raw green coffee beans there are many substances that are objectionable or undesirable, or even unhealthy. Please do not attempt to soak green beans in room temperature water and drink the broth. Heat needs to be applied to create changes in the substance of the green beans for them to become properly palatable.![unroasted green coffee beans ](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/green-coffee.DIuos-cL_Ziww1I.webp)_Green Coffee beans_  ### Why Green Coffee Bean Extract / Beverage? We make no health claims here for green beans; there are plenty of studies available on the Web that promote these beliefs if you would like to research them further. Most of the claimed benefits come from antioxidants and other substances that are reduced in potency if subjected to temperatures above ~300°F. Coffee is roasted anywhere from 350 °F to 600°, whereas when you boil green beans the temperature never rises above 212°F, a good temperature is just high enough to develop the antioxidants and convert the unpleasant substances into palatable ones. Dark-roasted coffee contains relatively small amounts of these substances, whereas lighter roasts contain more… and green beans have the most. ### Consider the Caffeine If you read about the Swiss Water Process® for making decaffeinated coffee, you learn that caffeine is an extremely water-soluble substance, able to leech out into the water until it is almost gone from the beans (97% removal of the caffeine is possible – sometimes expressed as being 99.9% caffeine-free by weight.) That’s a lot of caffeine coming out into the water! We can respect this fact when making green bean beverages with the best taste. We want to boil the beans long enough to get the healthy elements and flavor out of the beans, but not cause too much caffeine to come out. Caffeine is very bitter, and if you steep the beans too long, you wind up with a caffeine soup that will send you flying, making it hard to get enough of the “good stuff” without getting the jitters. ### Selecting Your Green Beans Everybody wants their food to be as clean and free of contaminants as possible. Coffee is very clean, generally testing free of any measurable contaminants, but many people are concerned about molds, as much has been written about it. The short story is that very few tests find significant mold, and the amounts found are on average far lower than many fruits and vegetables we consume daily. That being said, you will probably nevertheless feel better if you use green beans with a known origin, that have been water-washed and peeled by a milling machine, and not subjected to fermentation to get the beans ready to remove the fruit skins. The best beans for this process are high-altitude beans (they are lower in caffeine and denser) that have a clean, consistent appearance and aroma that is pleasant and like a vegetable or bean (our favorite coffee beans actually smell and look a lot like peas). Every crop and variety is a little different, but they should not have an unpleasant aroma. Two high-altitude bean recommendations are Costa Tarrazu and Papua New Guinea. Some high-altitude beans will have the designation SHB, which stands for Strictly Hard Bean. Don’t worry about the thin paper-like coating on the beans. Called the chaff or silver-skin, many researchers feel this is the healthiest part of the bean! So don’t try to scrub it off. ### Simple Steps for Boiling Beans Use a clean saucepan; a 1.5 or 2-quart is a good size.![3 water to 1 green beans](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/extract-glasses-measuring650.DSMWazLn_Gy8y4.webp) For the first batch, you may want to start with one cup (by volume) of green beans. For reference, this will probably be about 6 ounces of beans, but this recipe goes by volume, not weight. If you want to rinse the green beans because they are too “dusty” with chaff or because you just want to wash them, rinse them quickly in a colander, but don’t scrub them, and you will remove the nutrient-packed silver skin. The ratio to use is 1:3 parts beans to water, so fill the cup with beans and pour into the saucepan, then fill the cup 3 times with water and pour that in. Down the line, if you want to make larger batches, just double the beans and water, 2 cups beans to 6 cups water, etc.![simmering stirring green coffee beans](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/simmering-stirring450.BvGZvyxp_8XYYN.webp) Put the pan on high heat until the water is at a rolling boil, then reduce the heat to a simmer and set a timer for 12 minutes. Stir the beans occasionally so they are making good contact with the water and are not just sitting at the bottom.![straining green coffee bean extract ](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/straining450.SYjlWSn1_1tXI4b.webp) After the 12 minutes is up, take the pan off the heat, and pour the liquid through a kitchen strainer into a glass vessel or whatever you want to store the beverage concentrate in. Let it cool for a bit and put it in the fridge for later, or else use it immediately by pouring it over ice.![jar of green coffee bean concentrate](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/jar-of-concentrate450.DiMHqTQJ_Z1aMEwN.webp) NOTE OF CAUTION: You may find some references that tell you to let the beans steep after boiling for as long as an hour. The only reason to do this is if you want to create “rocket fuel” – a drink super-high in bitter caffeine that is basically unpalatable and probably not healthy at all. We really strongly suggest you limit your steeping enthusiasm to 12 minutes for best results. You can then discard the beans, or store them in the fridge and make another extract later on, up to a few days afterward. Then discard them. ### Delicious Green Bean Drinks![green coffee extract drink recipe](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/green-tea-recipes.C_8k1PSr_2tueFA.webp) The basic vegetable taste of the extract pairs well with sharp and acidic fruit flavors. Our favorites are cranberry and/or citrus fruits. Here are a few recipes to get you started: - Cranberry-Lime Refresher: 4oz GBE, 4oz lemon-lime soda (such as Sierra Mist) or lime-flavored seltzer, 2 tbsp cranberry syrup - Green Coffee Fresca: 4oz GBE, 4oz lemon-lime soda or lime-flavored seltzer, 2 tbsp grapefruit syrup - Blueberry GBE Lemonade: 4oz GBE, 4oz filtered water, juice of 1/2 lemon, 2 tbsp blueberry pancake syrup, sweetener to taste (such as agave syrup) - Green Tea EXTREME: 3oz GBE, 3oz filtered water, 1 green tea bag OR 1 tsp green tea leaves. Brew the tea in the water/GBE mixture for a concentrated antioxidant shot! This is good with a bit of honey, too. - Green Coffee Mojito: 4oz GBE, 3oz crushed ice, juice of 1/2 lime, five fresh mint leaves, sweetener to taste (such as cane sugar syrup)–be sure to muddle (roughly stir) the ice with the mint leaves, as bruising the leaves will release their minty deliciousness into your beverage You can also enjoy the green bean extract as a stock for cooking rice, as a soup ingredient, or for other creative uses. If it stays continuously cold, the extract will stay fresh for 2-3 days in the fridge, or you can freeze it for weeks of storage. We hope this guide makes selecting beans and making beverages from them easy and fun. ### References 1 (Antioxidant effects of coffee by-products 500 times greater than vitamin C, Science News Daily, 5/7/15, University of Granada) 2 (Assessment of Total (Free and Bound) Phenolic Compounds in Spent Coffee Extracts, Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry, 4/18/2015, Carmen Monente, Iziar A.

He would find the best heirloom coffees that remained largely undiscovered and unchanged by Western influence and showcase these coffees on the Internet. The search led him to Southeast Asian coffees (primarily Vietnamese and Philippine), established a century or more ago and still being cultivated, processed and brewed locally in traditional manners from an era gone by, unknown to the industry, markets, and media in the USA and Canada. Since that time Len has evaluated thousands of coffees in a continuing search for the original, traditional, and unspoiled, and expanded to unique Latin American coffees as well. He has undertaken the task of writing about these coffees, the cultures from which they came, and the manners in which they are brewed and enjoyed. His comment? “It’s a rough job, but somebody has to do it.” His company, Len’s Coffee, is devoted to helping indigenous producers gain access to international distribution under their own brand names so that they achieve the most “fair” of all trades, which is, eliminating commodities brokers and receiving all the fruits of their own labors. The overriding principle that guides his company is the belief that coffee, the second-highest-volume traded commodity in the world, has a tremendous and largely untapped potential to engineer social change and improve the quality of life for millions of people around the globe simply by the practice of making better choices, on the wholesale and consumer levels.

# Making Eggspresso [Recipes](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/coffee-recipes/)---by [Ryan Jacobs](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/ryan-jacobs/)![Making Eggspresso](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/making-eggspresso/eggspresso1.jpg) Recently, during a trip to Florida, I was at a coffee shop where they had a menu item called “Eggspresso”. Wondering what kind of sick concoction involved espresso and eggs, I inquired about this item. Would this be some sort of caffeinated cousin to egg drop soup, or would I find Folgers Crystals in my omelet? The real menu item wasn’t so daring. I discovered that “Eggspresso” was a method of cooking eggs that involved no espresso at all. It did, however, require the frothing wand of an espresso machine. I needed to see this dish prepared before my eyes to get my wheels turning. Most mornings, I have a double espresso and a couple of eggs. I like both items. Now, I could see a way to streamline my morning ritual and have less to clean up. ### Selecting The Equipment While making quality espresso requires you to have a high-quality espresso machine, making eggpresso doesn’t have such restrictions. Making eggspresso only requires a good steam wand. Most home espresso machines have decent frothing wands with which to cook the eggs. Next, you will need a good container to put the eggs in. Oddly enough, I have found that coffee mugs work very well because you can fit three eggs in them, and they have enough depth for the wand to reach into. Using the frothing pitcher that came with your espresso machine or even your favorite coffee mug is probably a bad idea unless you don’t mind the risk of salmonella poisoning from your next latte. ### Cooking the Eggs The first step in this dish is to crack your eggs into your container. Whip them a bit with a fork. Try not to be tempted to add such things as salsa, sauces, or other things you might find in an omelet. The moisture content of these items will add to the moisture which will come from the steam. Such ingredients should be added after the eggs have been cooked.![Add steam to eggs](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/step1_200x200.fRS3BWBe_Z1h0PFt.webp) Next, open the steam valve on your espresso machine to bleed off the excess water that has collected. Shut the valve quickly. Immerse the wand into the eggs and begin steaming fully.![continue steaming eggs](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/step2_200x200.CgVo7dVg_Z1AqztW.webp)![froth eggs](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/step3_200x200.DvKxWMo-_Gnqbi.webp) Cook until the eggs solidify. Shut off the steam valve. Congratulations! The eggs are now cooked. But before you begin greedily consuming, clean the eggs from your frothing wand.![clean wand](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/clean_200x200.BYRzXkZl_1Oi67L.webp) At this point, you can either dump the eggs onto a plate or eat them straight from the cup. Since the eggs are a bit more moist than normal, I have found that around a tablespoon of quick oats works well to absorb the moisture and doesn’t adversely affect the flavor. Going much further than this is probably a bad idea though. The idea I had for mixing espresso directly into the eggs with oatmeal was disastrous. Some might need to learn this firsthand, but at least you were warned.

# Making Lampshades and Flowers With Used Coffee Filters [Cafe Culture](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/cafe-culture/)---by [Michael Allen Smith](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/michael-allen-smith/)![Making Lampshades and Flowers With Used Coffee Filters](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/making-lampshades-and-flowers-with-used-coffee-filters/coffee-filter-lampshade.jpg) At INeedCoffee, we always want to see what artistic things can be created using coffee. We have [three](https://ineedcoffee.com/coffee-art/) [different](https://ineedcoffee.com/art-of-farr-coffee-greeting-cards/) [galleries](https://ineedcoffee.com/the-coffee-art-corporation/) by different artists that have used coffee grounds to create amazing artwork. Vilma Silveira Farrell takes a different path. Instead of using coffee grounds, she uses coffee filters to make her artwork. In a series of emails, I learned that Vilma collects used coffee filters from coffee shops. The filters are cleaned and dried, then dyed to the desired color. If you want a dark brown color, the coffee grounds are left inside the filter during the drying process. Once dry, the grounds are removed. ### Coffee Filter Lampshades The coffee filter lampshades are made with a wire mesh for sturdiness. A fire retardant is used on the filters, and the lampshades are open at the top and bottom for air circulation. > Handcrafting a coffee filter lampshade is timing consuming. It takes hours and hours and sometimes days of work but is amazingly rewarding – especially when a lamp is finished, the light switch hit, and I can see how beautifully the light filters through the shade.![lampshade-3](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/lampshade-3.Bm-PNx6q_1SIOtx.webp)![lampshade-5](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/lampshade-5.CHLUYZk8_29etwM.webp)![lampshade-4](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/lampshade-4.gW5-F4Q3_Z1wO3A3.webp) ### Coffee Filter Wall Flowers In addition to lampshades, Vilma has used coffee filters to create flowers on canvas.![flowers-5](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/flowers-5-616x650.CgnxGKb-_ZT2upn.webp)![flowers-4](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/flowers-4.CCAjeX04_1J5Lio.webp)![flowers-3](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/flowers-3.Cd71V_lp_1d6BNH.webp)![flowers-2](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/flowers-2.DUP16C1h_R8vYq.webp)![flowers-1](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/flowers-1.BPAWeiE6_Zgmg5X.webp) ### About the Artist Vilma Silveira Farrell is the artisan behind Lampada.

# Making Lattes Without an Espresso Machine [Espresso](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/espresso/)---by [Michael Allen Smith](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/michael-allen-smith/)![Making Lattes Without an Espresso Machine](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/making-lattes-without-espresso-machine/making-lattes-without-espresso-machine.png)_All price references in this article are in US Dollars._ Most coffee fans know you need an espresso machine to make a latte. Lattes, be they iced or hot, require espresso, and espresso comes from an espresso machine. And unlike most coffee brewers, which can be purchased for under $100 and often under $50, espresso machines can cost a lot. Over the years, I’ve seen home espresso machines for sale in the $300 to $3000 price range. Add another $200 to $1000 for a grinder and a few more bucks for accessories, and suddenly, you are looking at quite the investment needed to make your first latte. You also need a dedicated space in your kitchen, which some of us don’t have. This is why many coffee fans make brewed coffee at home and purchase espresso-based drinks in the coffee shops. Now, if you drink lattes daily, even a pricey espresso machine will pay for itself in time. But spending all that money upfront will turn many latte fans off from the idea of making their lattes at home. This summer, I was asked if one could make lattes at home without an espresso machine. My initial answer was no. Espresso requires pressure—a lot of pressure. Typically, it requires 9 bars, 9 times the atmospheric pressure at sea level. You can’t do that without an espresso machine. But could you fake it?![Perfect Latte](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/perfect-latte1.Nikmn06O_ZMvMf2.webp) ### The Challenge Espresso is concentrated coffee. To have a chance of faking a latte, we needed to find a brewing method capable of producing a coffee where the taste approaches espresso. Granted, we aren’t going to fool any espresso drinker or enthusiast. **The goal is to get close and create a fake latte that will do in a pinch.** Three coffee brewing methods were tested. 1. Cold Brew Concentrate 2. AeroPress 3. Stovetop Espresso ### #1 Cold Brew Concentrate The cold brew concentrate did not work at all. Even though it was concentrated, it lacked the mouthfeel, acidity, and richness of espresso. It was too clean. When the milk was added, it tasted nothing like a latte. It tasted just like coffee with milk. We would like to thank _Bizzy_ for donating the Cold Brew Coffee used to research this article. It is a fine cold brew, but it did not work as a substitute for espresso in our latte challenge. ### #2 AeroPress The AeroPress is an amazing coffee brewer. As I covered in the article [The Upside Down AeroPress Brewing Tutorial](https://ineedcoffee.com/upside-aeropress-coffee-brewing-tutorial/), there are many ways to brew coffee. Change the grind, brewing temperature, brewing time, or even the position of the brewer, and you can still make an excellent cup of coffee. You can also make concentrated fake espresso shots. I’m using the term _fake_ because even though the AeroPress generates pressure with its plunger, it is well short of the 9 bars produced by espresso machines. When making an AeroPress espresso shot, I conducted numerous tests and found that a 3.5 ratio works best. This means that for every gram of coffee you use, you add 3.5 grams of water. In the first version of this article, I stated I preferred using a traditional method over the inverted method. I’ve changed my mind and now use the [inverted method](https://ineedcoffee.com/upside-aeropress-coffee-brewing-tutorial/). The reason is that the seal tends to weaken as your AeroPress ages. The result is that the coffee passes through the chamber too quickly, which can result in under-extracted coffee. Your other option is to use the Prismo replacement filter. The Prismo was developed to help your AeroPress make more espresso-like shots. It uses a finer filter with a tighter seal than what comes with the AeroPress. For a detailed review, check out Prismo Filter Upgrade For AeroPress Review and Tips. 1. Add 20 grams of [fine ground coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/coffee-grind-chart/) to the AeroPress. 2. Slowly add 70 grams of hot water (202°F). 3. Stir enough to ensure the water is contacting all the coffee grounds. Break up any clumps. 4. Wait 60-90 seconds. 5. Plunge. If you want more espresso volume, you can increase this recipe to 25 grams of ground coffee and 87.5 grams of water.![AeroPress steep](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/aeropress-steep.OUwtSXn5_Z2jgCk5.webp) *Aeropress Coffee and Espresso Maker * If your shot tastes too bitter, you can reduce the brew time or the water. If it tastes weak or sour, you can increase the brew time or water. As a general rule, lighter roasts need more water or longer brew times, while darker roasts need less. ### #3 Stovetop Espresso Stovetop espresso makers are also known as Moka Pots or Bialetti. Despite the name, they aren’t true espresso machines because they do not produce the pressure of an actual espresso machine. On a CoffeeGeek forum*, a discussion estimated that a stovetop espresso maker generated 2 bars of pressure. Despite the lower pressure, the Moka Pot did a fine job of making a concentrated shot of coffee. For guidance on this brewer, see the article [Stovetop Espresso Brewing Tutorial](https://ineedcoffee.com/stovetop-espresso-brewing-tutorial/). I got the best results when I filled the bottom chamber with water until it was about 70% full. You may need to tweak that number to fit your personal preference. That is just a starting point. I used the 3-cup Bialetti for my test.![add coffee to stovetop espresso](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/add-coffee-to-stovetop-espresso.BH7nvqde_zWvEk.webp) ### The Winner Both the AeroPress and the Stovetop Espresso Maker did a fine job. If you already have one of these brewers, use it. With the AeroPress, I can control when water contacts the beans. Also, since I have a great electric kettle, the brew time is faster. The Prismo filter slightly improves the shots I would normally get from a standard AeroPress.However, if you need more “espresso” volume, the larger 6-Cup Bialetti model beats the AeroPress. ### Onto the Milk Now that we have our “espresso”, let us get the milk portion. Since our “espresso” shots will not be as intense as true espresso, reducing the amount of milk in your drink is a good idea. Start with half the milk you normally drink and gradually increase it to the level that suits you. If you decide to make an iced latte, you only need milk and ice cubes. Done. For hot lattes, we need to heat and froth milk. Some wands froth the milk, which cost between $6 and $15, but you will need to warm the milk yourself. In the $40-$130 range, there are dedicated milk frothers that will also heat the milk to the perfect temperature. These milk frothers have become very impressive in recent years. ### Handheld Espresso Makers If you’ve tried the ideas in this article and aren’t satisfied, yet you still don’t want to spend a lot of money on a countertop espresso machine, there is a middle option: handheld espresso makers. They run around $100 or less and have built-in hand pumps. See our article Battle of the Handheld Espresso Makers: Handpresso Wild Hybrid vs. [Wacaco Minipresso GR](https://ineedcoffee.com/battle-handheld-espresso-makers-handpresso-wild-hybrid-vs-wacaco-minipresso-gr/) for more information on this brewing method. I also want to mention the [UniTerra Nomad](https://ineedcoffee.com/uniterra-nomad-espresso-machine-review/), which costs nearly $300. ### Conclusion You can not replicate espresso without an espresso machine, but you can get closer using the AeroPress or Stovetop Espresso Maker and a milk frother. Only you can make that call if it is close enough for your tastes. But when it comes to economics, it isn’t even close. You can make a fake latte at home for under $1. With coffee shops charging $3 – $4 for the same drink, you can save $2 – $3 per order. It doesn’t take too many days before you have enough money saved to buy your espresso machine. ### References [Prismo Filter Upgrade For AeroPress Review and Tips](https://ineedcoffee.com/prismo-filter-upgrade-for-aeropress-review-and-tips/) – A filter replacement that will help you get better shots with an AeroPress.

# Brewing Coffee with the Java Maestro Pour Over Coffee Dripper [Brewing Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/brewing-coffee/)---by [Michael Allen Smith](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/michael-allen-smith/)![Brewing Coffee with the Java Maestro Pour Over Coffee Dripper](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/making-pour-over-coffee/java-maestro-pour-over-coffee-dripper.jpg) This month, I’ve been playing with my latest coffee brewer, a stainless steel pour-over coffee filter made by Java Maestro. What makes this particular pour-over coffee brewer interesting is that it doesn’t require a paper filter—the dripper is the filter. There are two benefits to not needing a paper filter. The first is economical. Not having to buy filters is one less expense. The second benefit is that you get all the oils from coffee in the cup. This gives the coffee a richness that is sometimes sacrificed with paper-filtered coffee. However, paper filters benefit by keeping all the coffee grounds out of the cup, which results in a cleaner cup of coffee. The Java Maestro Pour Over Coffee Dripper does such an excellent job with filtering that it not only makes a rich cup of coffee but also a clean one.![jm-pour-over](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/jm-pour-over.CjXJ5ufE_Z1WgS2V.webp)_The Java Maestro Pour Over Coffee Dripper_### #1 Heat Water I strongly recommend getting a Bonavita 1-liter Variable Temperature Digital Electric Gooseneck Kettle for this brewing method. As with any pour-over coffee, you are responsible for making sure the coffee is saturated with hot water. Being able to control the water flow will make that task much easier. ### #2 Hot Water Rinse The Java Maestro is made of stainless steel. Before you start brewing, give it a quick rinse of hot water from the sink. This will preheat the dripper and minimize heat loss. ### #3 Place Brewer over Mug The Pour-Over Coffee Dripper is a one-mug-at-a-time brewer. The only question is how big a mug you’ll be using. If you are not weighing as you add water, there is a risk you could add too much water and cause a mess. There is a tiny visible hole in the brewer where you can view the progress of your pour-over. This is not ideal. A glass mug or jar would be a better approach.![jm-pour-over-mug](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/jm-pour-over-mug.Cb5I5daY_1AsWEF.webp) ### #4 Add Ground Coffee Grind your coffee  [medium-fine](https://ineedcoffee.com/coffee-grind-chart/). The Java Maestro Pour Over Coffee Dripper includes a scooper that also serves as a coffee bag clip. Use 3 scoops for a single 12-ounce mug. If you lose the scooper or want to use a gram scale, I use 20 grams of coffee and 310 grams of water. That works out to a 15.5 to 1 ratio (water to coffee).![jm-add-ground-coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/jm-add-ground-coffee.CWsljagw_2evfXs.webp) ### #5 Add Hot Water With the kettle, you’ll be adding coffee in the 195 F—205 F range. For more information about brewing temperature, see section #2 in the article Hacking Dark Roast— [Tips on Brewing a Better Bold Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/hacking-dark-roast-tips-on-brewing-a-better-bold-coffee/). For the initial pour, add enough water to cover the coffee grounds and allow them to bloom. For those weighing, this works out to about double the weight of the ground coffee. So, if we use 20 grams of coffee, the initial pour will be 40 grams of water.![jm-add-initial-water](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/jm-add-initial-water.BKvhXlKo_Z2hcQl2.webp) Let the coffee sit for 20 seconds, and then continue pouring the remainder of the water. The water will be poured slowly in a circular motion, even and smooth.![jm-more-water](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/jm-more-water.CUxpr_um_Z1z4mzA.webp) ### #6 Remove the Filter and Enjoy Once all the coffee has exited the brewer, you are done. Enjoy your coffee. ### #7 Cleanup Empty the used grounds into a compost bin or set them aside for gardening. You can wash the filter with hot, soapy water. It is also dishwasher-friendly. ### Additional Coffee Filtering While playing with the Pour Over Coffee Dripper, we discovered the filter was so good that it could be used as an additional filter for other coffee brewing methods. Full immersion brewing methods such as the French Press or some cold brewing methods sometimes have a little grit, which are those loose grounds that sneak past the filter. Using the Java Maestro as an additional filter will improve the flavor of your French Press and [Swedish Egg Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/the-smoothest-cup-youll-ever-drink-swedish-egg-coffee/)._Disclosure: INeedCoffee was sent this product at no cost._ Published on January 26, 2018--- #### Michael Allen Smith Michael Allen Smith is both a coffee fanatic and a web developer.

# Making Sure the Seal Means the Real Deal [Coffee History](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/coffee-history/)---by [Paul Gallagher](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/paul-gallagher/)![Making Sure the Seal Means the Real Deal](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/making-sure-the-seal-means-the-real-deal/cib_seal_authentic4251.jpg) For generations, coffee aficionados have embraced the deliciously subtle coffee known as Jamaica Blue Mountain coffee. And for generations, only one supplier of Jamaica Blue Mountain coffee can match many fans’ demanding tastes: Mavis Bank Central Factory. Nestled in the Blue Mountains of Jamaica, Mavis Bank was founded by Victor Munn in 1920 with one goal: to be the island’s only fully integrated processing facility for the production of Blue Mountain coffee from the berry to the cup. Victor knew the value of maintaining quality in Jamaica Blue Mountain coffee; after all, his father, Cecil Augustus Munn first cultivated and processed the coffee. Victor’s nephew, Keble, has continued to carry on the tradition of producing the world’s finest coffee, all the while upgrading Mavis Bank’s facilities and expanding to include roughly 40-percent of all Jamaica Blue Mountain coffee processing.![Jamaica Blue Mountain Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/cib_seal_authentic4251.CRKUmZua_ZqHjJu.webp)_Jamaica Blue Mountain_ The challenges toward keeping quality control over such an expansive business can be daunting, but Edgar Munn, Victor’s nephew, says the rewards are worth it. As the primary licensed importer of all Jamaica Blue Mountain coffee in the U.S., Edgar works closely with the Coffee Industry Board of Jamaica, which regulates and certifies all export quality Jamaica Blue Mountain coffee. “Jamaica Blue Mountain coffee is a very special type of coffee,” says Edgar. That may sound like he’s stating the obvious, but he continues to explain that Jamaica is blessed with more coffees than what has become known as the world-class Jamaica Blue Mountain. “The coffee that is Jamaica Blue Mountain is grown in a very specified area in the Blue Mountains,” he says. In addition to tight restrictions on the geographic area, there are also rules about the elevation at which certifiable Jamaica Blue Mountain coffee can be grown. “There is Jamaica Blue Mountain, grown in a specific area, at 3,000 to 5,000 feet (in elevation); then, there is High Mountain coffee, from a specific area, grown from 1,500 to 3,000 feet; and then there is Jamaica Supreme, or Low Mountain, beneath the High Mountain coffee.” Each class of coffee requires a review and certification for export from the Coffee Industry Board. Yet, according to the New Economy Project from USAID, that seal of approval has not always guaranteed either consistency of quality or regulatory oversight beyond the time the coffee is exported from Jamaica. Edgar acknowledges that there have been difficulties maintaining the certifiable quality of Jamaica Blue Mountain coffee, especially in the United States. “There is no regulation in the United States that prohibits roasters from selling coffee that isn’t Jamaica Blue Mountain under the Jamaica Blue Mountain label,” he says. “There is not even a minimum quantity of pure Jamaica Blue Mountain coffee that must be added to be called a Jamaica Blue Mountain blend.” In Japan, where enormous quantities of Jamaica Blue Mountain coffee are exported, the minimum standard to qualify as a Jamaica Blue Mountain blend is 30-percent. In Jamaica, ironically, the standard is lower – 20-percent must be pure JBM. “But here in the United States, some roasters will use anywhere from six to 10-percent, and some will use all the photos and items they can to indicate that their coffee is quality and a certified blend,” says Edgar. “Yet, they don’t actually put what the percentage is.” Some roasters have been caught by Edgar and the Coffee Industry Board fraudulently selling Jamaica Blue Mountain coffee, and have been brought before the courts for trademark infringement. But Jamaica Blue Mountain coffee isn’t merely another brand. Its legendary balance; its subtle sweetness and delicate “mouth feel” – these have made authentic JBM both rare and embraced by consumers worldwide. When people pay a premium for such a singularly refined coffee, they’re paying for the coffee, of course, but they’re also paying for the dream. In fact, some may care less about the coffee than in the dream. Edgar readily acknowledges the power of that perception; it is, after all, part of the power behind the brand. While he sells directly to the consumer through his own website – [www.bluemountaincoffeeinc.com](http://www.bluemountaincoffeeinc.com), he’s cautious about selling to coffee brokers or coffee wholesalers. Those to whom he does supply bulk coffee (such as Gillies Coffee Company, in Brooklyn – and Cohveca Coffee) are long-term contacts in whom he can place his trust. “When we sell to some brokers, then we lose control,” he says. “We can’t afford to lose that control. It is not good for the coffee. The Coffee Industry Board must maintain and develop the best product, and we must supply the best coffee that can match everyone’s dream.” Published on November 1, 2005--- #### Paul Gallagher Paul Gallagher is the roastmaster for Cohveca Coffee.

# Manual Coffee Grinder Comparison (Thirst Friend, Ritual, and Bold Bean Architects) [Grinding Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/grinding-coffee/)---by [Chris Arnold](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/chris-arnold/)![Manual Coffee Grinder Comparison (Thirst Friend, Ritual, and Bold Bean Architects)](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/manual-coffee-grinder-comparison-thirst-friend-ritual-and-bold-bean-architects/All_Grinder_Collage.jpg)_**UPDATE (September 2020):** The grinders featured in this article are no longer available for sale._ A manual coffee grinder (aka coffee mill or hand grinder) has a few advantages over its electric-powered brethren: lower cost, portability, and, in some cases, even consistency. They can be great for those on a budget, travelers, campers, or even those looking to lower their electricity bill a few watts at a time. We will be taking a look at three manual ceramic burr coffee grinders from Thirst Friend, Ritual, and Bold Bean Architects. We will compare the ability to [grind different levels](https://ineedcoffee.com/coffee-grind-chart/): fine for espresso, medium for drip, and coarse for French press, as well as things like ease of use, ease of adjustment, size, and build quality. ### Thirst Friend The Thirst Friend Large grinder is actually the smallest in the roundup, with its reservoir holding just about 3 ounces by volume. It is very compact and easy to grip both the body and handle, even for someone with small hands. The handle does not attach with any hardware, it simply uses gravity and a keyed slot. Lack of locking hardware never seemed to be a problem, and this means it is very quick to disassemble.![Thirst Friend Manual Grinder](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/Thirst-Small-1-650x433.Cl1hrlBB_1rcKAF.webp)_Thirst Friend Large Coffee Grinder with included coffee scoop/clip_ There was no printed manual included, but it took less than 30 seconds to figure out how everything worked. The top just pulls apart, and beans are loaded in. The bottom also pulls apart where your finished grind ends up. This is also the place where you can very easily tighten or loosen the burr to adjust the grind level. The adjustment range is very wide and does a respectable job for fine, medium, and coarse grind. The fine grind worked great for espresso and was very consistent. The medium grind also did quite well for drip. The coarse grind was reasonably consistent though not perfect, and French Press did not have too much fine sediment, though consistent French press grind is one of the hardest of all to achieve. The beans were relatively easy to load and had no problem feeding into the grinding mechanism. The unit didn’t have a super solid feel, but just about everything was metal (albeit slightly thinner than the others). I expected the unit to ding if dropped, but nothing stood out as feeling cheap. They also give you a coffee scoop/bag clip combo for free, which is cool.![Thirst Friend Grind Levels](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/Thirst_Collage-1-650x488.o9QQUV0K_ZFCDyj.webp)_Thirst Friend Grind Levels. Did very well, from fine to coarse._> What I liked most about the Thirst Friend was how easy everything came apart and went back together so fast. And zero hardware to unthread and rethread. Even the grind adjustment had a nice rubber knob that stayed put. ### Bold Bean Architects The Bold Bean Architects’ grinder is relatively large but only holds approximately 5 ounces by volume. It is not too difficult to hold thanks to a thinner middle section but does take a little work to get a decent grip.![Bold Bean Architect Manual Grinder](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/Bold-Small-1-650x534.BYRkzVz3_GG70m.webp)_Bold Bean Architects Coffee Grinder_ There was no manual included, and the website instructions were not too helpful. The top section has a little plastic window that slides out of the way, exposing about half of the hopper. The beans were somewhat hard to load and had problems feeding into the grinding mechanism towards the end, which needed some help in the form of shaking. The bottom section threads nicely and tightly to the main body. The handle is quite difficult to remove and involves taking just about everything apart in order to do it. But the thing is built like a tank. There are 3 different nuts total, and 2 of them are used together for the grind level adjustment. It turns out the adjustment range is very narrow, and after fiddling for several minutes it is clear the design is to blame. As a result, it only produced a fine grind for espresso at both ends of the range.![Bold Grind Levels](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/Bold-Collage-1-488x650.CoSllzRV_1OAakk.webp)_Bold Bean Architect Grind Level. Only a fine grind was possible, given the limits of adjustment._> What I liked most about the Bold Bean Architects Grinder was it’s solid build quality. ### Ritual Grinder The Ritual Grinder is the largest in the roundup, with its reservoir holding about 10 ounces by volume. It is quite large and awkward to hold with a firm grip. There is a top rubber piece included that presumably keeps beans inside, but I found it didn’t really seat well and was sort of unnecessary.  The top piece sort of unscrews from the base but doesn’t use matching threads on the top piece, just little divots, so it took a little work to get it locked in. Beans are easy to load given the fully open hopper (with the rubber piece removed), and the beans fed fine when the hopper was full, but as it got emptier, it required some manual help to move the beans into the grinding mechanism.![Ritual Manual Grinder](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/Ritual-Small-1-650x444.H5fJkdga_Z1cngkS.webp)_Ritual Coffee Grinder_ The handle detaches with a single top nut. The grind level adjustment requires dealing with three pieces: the top nut, a middle locking nut, and the bottom adjustment nut. The adjustment range is decent and produces a good medium grind and a decent coarse grind, but I wasn’t quite able to get fine enough for espresso. Adjusting this design took a lot of time. It is built well, but the fit was a little lacking; it just felt a little loose in places.![Ritual Grind Levels](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/Ritual-Small-2-650x488.CAKyAQDO_ZPqfqq.webp)_Ritual Grind Levels. Did well on Medium, decent on Coarse, but not fine enough for espresso_> What I liked most about the Ritual Grinder was it’s extra large reservoir. ### Conclusion At $35, the Bold Bean Architect Manual Grinder can only be recommended for use with espresso. Its fiddly adjustments and other design choices leave a lot to be desired, but it is probably the best-built. At $25, the Ritual Manual Grinder is a good choice for pour-over/drip/cone, where a large volume of coffee is desired. At $25, the Thirst Friend Manual Grinder is recommended for use with espresso, pour-over/drip/cone, or French press, where a smaller volume of coffee is suitable or where maximum portability is important. ### Resources_Bold Bean Architects Grinder, Ritual Grinder, and Thirst Friend Grinder are no longer available on Amazon.__Disclosure: INeedCoffee was sent some of these products at no cost, which did not affect its review._ Published on November 9, 2015--- #### Chris Arnold Chris is the creator of Two Bit History.

# The Many Faces of Coffee [Coffee Business](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/coffee-business/)---by [Joseph Robertson](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/joseph-robertson/)![The Many Faces of Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/many-faces-coffee/many-faces-of-coffee.jpg) “Coffee Honey” – the first time I saw this, I was exploring the original Akha Ama Cafe in Chiang Mai, Thailand. I was doing as I do when checking out a new cafe – tasting their coffees and just letting my eyes wander around the shop. I usually ignore the pastry display cases because, well…I’m there for coffee, not undeniably deliciously flaky pastries that I clearly have no need for (temptation is always hiding under those lights). In this case, my eye caught on the tiny 4 oz jars simply labeled ‘Coffee Honey.’ “Excuse me!” I said with an open smile. Side note: a smile takes you miles further than any other facial expression. I would say, ‘especially in Thailand,’ which is known as ‘The Land of Smiles’ – but I think this applies anywhere. In Thailand though, it seems you can say anything so long as there is a smile with it. In any case, I was curious about this honey.![Coffee Honey](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/coffee-honey.DOnOU6Ey_26cBRY.webp) “Is this Honey made for coffee, or made with coffee in it?” I was imagining one of two scenarios. That this was just poor translation / an awkward attempt at marketing (it’s honey we made specifically for coffee!) – in Thailand it is pretty ordinary to see completely false claims about products right out in the open – or they had some strange concoction involving mixing coffee with honey. Well, I was straight wrong on all accounts. “It’s…Honey from the Coffee Flower,” the Thai girl working there said after a pause to consider her words. “It’s honey from the coffee flower? You mean, the bees did their business with the flowers from YOUR coffee plants, and you harvested THAT honey?” I said, entirely too quickly, with a mixture of incredulity and wonder. “Uh…yes!” She responded with a smile (that is, she probably didn’t understand what I was saying, but her yes satisfied me and ended the conversation).![coffee honey flower](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/coffee-flower.BPgD-MnO_Z1c0zqV.webp) I immediately grabbed a jar, and got the contact information for the owner – I just had to learn what this was all about. After returning to my apartment, I opened my new prize and had a taste. Immediately, my eyes popped open wider, and I started searching for flavors to associate with – just as I would do with a new espresso, for example. Right away, it struck me. Hiding on the back of the flavor – strong, sweet, silky smooth honey – was the very distinct floral flavor I had already tasted that same day. I had tasted it in the very coffee whose plants originated the flowers which fed the bees that created the honey I was now enjoying. Wonderous!![Coffee Honey Flower tin](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/coffee-flower-leaves.BQqNJHel_1zVALR.webp) It’s such a small thing but so very cool to discover this direct flavor, which I had tasted in the coffee itself, again in something so very different, but so well connected. I tend to think of the flavors in coffee as being something you simply connect associations with – that is, we say this Ethiopian Yirgacheffe tastes like blueberries because it gives us the same flavor/aroma sensations as walking through a wild blueberry field. It’s easier to attribute the responsibility for this flavor (the coffee seed comes from a berry). In a similar vein, I’ve declared coffees to have floral elements, but I have no strong understanding of where that element comes from. The fact that a bee can extract, transfer, and convert the exact same flavor I find in a coffee, into honey, is wickedly cool. It doesn’t stop there. I had the pleasure of meeting with the owner of Akha Ama, Lee Ayu Chupa – a young man who has gone beyond all boundaries that one in his position typically faces, and is forging a very impressive company around coffee. I asked him about the Coffee Honey, and he explained it quite simply. As his family is the owner of their primary farm, they are able to experiment in a few ways. A couple of years ago, they decided to place beehives directly on the coffee farm, so that when harvesting the honey, they could be reasonably certain that the majority of the honey was from the coffee flowers. No one else was doing it. As we know – bees love coffee – so why not enjoy honey that they make directly from that coffee? I asked Lee – well, since you are experimenting, have you thought about Coffee Flower Tea? I had the fortune to try this out at the Melbourne International Coffee Expo in May, as Ninety Plus Coffee brought some of their Geisha Flower Tea.![coffee shop thailand](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/coffee-thailand.DOZDPcXm_1xXljl.webp) Lee smiled and said, “of course.” There was a bit of trial and error involved. Lee had heard about other people doing coffee flower tea, so one year he decided to give it a shot – shortly before the petals of the flowers were to naturally fall off, he picked a few and tried to make some tea. “It was…not right,” he said, with a mildly disgusted look on his face. The coffee flower brewed as tea directly was bitter and uninviting. So his mother took a handful of the blossoms, tossed them in a pan on the stove, and roasted them ever so delicately to a slight golden brown color. He showed me the coffee flower tea – it smells absolutely wonderful. So sweet, savory, and floral…very much like smelling the coffee – but as if you could only smell the floral element. 5 minutes later, I had my face over a small cup of brewed tea – inhaling I could tell the tea was relatively strong in flavor – much less delicate than the coffee the plants eventually would produce (the Ponlamai). The first sip brings a strong flavor, smooth, and sweet tea. When I brought these components back to the states and had a little tasting event with folks in Seattle, the initial reaction of one person was “this tea is flavored, right?” It’s a remarkable balance between honey and coffee. Compared to the honey, the tea is far lighter and smoother in flavor, like the coffee. Looking at the coffee, the tea clearly illustrates the floral element that is present there. This is what tied it all together. The coffee flower tea, sweet and simple, presents the exact flavor of that flower. This flavor is evident in the honey and coffee.![Adding Coffee Honey to drink](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/coffee-add-honey.4xs4yPzU_Z2t057t.webp) Three elements, all connected, but not directly – all displaying flavors of the coffee plant as a whole, which to me just opens up the world of coffee all the more. It isn’t just a roasted seed, and it isn’t even just the seed of a cherry. What you taste in coffee is a distinct representation of the plant as a whole, and I imagine contains elements that are evident throughout the plant. The last piece of the puzzle which brought me to that final conclusion – Lee shared with me that he likes to eat the top leaves of the coffee plant, usually in a salad with some tuna (I, unfortunately, didn’t get a chance to try this). He said they are citrusy and sweet. Sound familiar? Citrus and sweetness – are two elements common among coffees. I wonder what other parts of the coffee plant could be equally enjoyed…_The Many Faces of Coffee first appeared in [Extracted Magazine #23](https://www.extractedmagazine.com/brewing-on-the-v60-issue-59/)._  ### Resources Coffee Lovers Radio #7 – Interview with Lee Ayu Chupa.

# McDonalds Should Buy Starbucks [Coffee Business](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/coffee-business/)---by [Marketman](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/marketman/)![McDonalds Should Buy Starbucks](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/mcdonalds-should-buy-starbucks/sbux-dbc-ineedcoffee1.jpg)_This article was released in August 2008._ The Starbucks stock price topped out at nearly $40 per share twice in 2006 but has been steadily falling since that double top formation and now sits at around $14.40 per share. By many accounts, 2006 was also the peak of the housing bubble, and leaky home values have issued a strong blow to consumer spending since that time. Two of the hardest-hit states in terms of housing are also two states that makeup nearly 30 percent of the Starbucks stores in the United States. A $5 latte may not have been a stretch two years ago, but in the midst of this deflating economy and credit crisis, consumers are cutting back. However, consumer spending is not the only thing that is ailing Starbucks. They are also struggling with higher acquisition costs of their two staple ingredients – coffee and milk. In fact, over the past two years, the Deutsche Bank commodity index (DBC) and Starbucks (SBUX) appear to be an exact mirror image of each other:![SBUX commodity chart](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/sbux-dbc-ineedcoffee1.DReKoWjL_Zt1huR.webp)_SBUX vs Commodity Index_ McDonald’s is another company affected by higher commodity input costs, but that fact is certainly not reflected in its share price, which has hit several 52-week highs already this year. McDonald’s healthy operating model allowed it to pay off $1 billion in long-term debt in 2007. Yet Starbucks, which operated most of its life with insignificant near-zero long-term debt, suddenly racked up $550 million in long-term debt during 2007.![McCafe - Phuket, Thailand](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/mccafe-phuket-thailand.B0NAmC9G_2euI7w.webp)_McCafe – Phuket, Thailand_ McDonald’s is also pursuing the high-end coffee market through its aggressive expansion of stores offering the McLatte. This is happening at the same time that Starbucks is reversing its expansion into McDonald’s traditional breakfast sandwich territory. It seems that in every area where Starbucks is struggling and failing, McDonald’s is thriving and conquering. However, Starbucks’s struggle will not last forever. Howard Schultz is taking significant steps to reverse the downtrend – revising the menu, closing poorly performing stores, and even offering a new customer loyalty program. Global commodity prices have also shown signs of leakiness, and any continued price relief on the milk and coffee front could be a potential windfall for Starbucks. If McDonald’s is serious about its coffee expansion plans, it must take action now. The opportunity to acquire the biggest name in coffee during their weakest days won’t last forever—Mcdonald’s needs to buy Starbucks now._Disclosure: The author of the above article holds a long position in Starbucks._ Published on August 1, 2008--- #### Marketman Marketman is a full time investor, trader and entrepreneur.

# Meet the Coffee Robot [Coffee Business](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/coffee-business/)---by [Michael Allen Smith](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/michael-allen-smith/)![Meet the Coffee Robot](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/meet-the-coffee-robot/Meet-the-Coffee-Robot.jpg) Recently, I watched a very cool video of a robot capable of making espresso drinks. This wasn’t a vending-style machine where the coffee is made under the hood. This robot had an arm that actually pulled espresso shots from an espresso machine. The coffee robot is called the Rozum Café. I interviewed Anna Kidron from the company to learn more.![razum cafe](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/razum-coffee-robot.CQZv9-UA_2dsX2U.webp) #### When did the development of the Rozum Café begin, and how long did it take to build the robot? The company Rozum Robotics was opened in 2015. The main Rozum products are the collaborative robotic arm PULSE and motors for robots. How did it all turn into the robotic Rozum Café? One day, at the beginning of 2019, our developers and engineers were in the kitchen, laughing, chatting, and programming a robot to pour and serve them ready-made coffee just for fun. A few weeks later, the CEO of the company who was also in the kitchen at that time was like ‘Hey, dudes, why not make a real robot barista?’ That was the beginning. We searched the market and found out that there was nothing like an autonomous, available-for-purchase robotic café. During the next 6 months, we built the framework, bought all the tech components like a grinder, a tamper, an espresso machine, etc, taught the robot how to work with this equipment, and asked the human baristas to share their experience with us and the robot. We conducted numerous tests and drank liters of coffee. This was a sleepless time. When six months were over, the first working version of the robot café was installed in a shop mall in Ukraine.![coffee robot reach](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/reach-cup.D_TsPIJa_ZiWKYT.webp) #### What were some of the biggest challenges you faced during the design process? The biggest problem we faced at the very start was to make a robot take a cup. Sounds banal, doesn’t it? But paper cups differ in size, structure, and thickness. A robot arm should take an empty cup very carefully not to crumple it. After the robot fills the cup with coffee, milk, and syrup, the cup gets heavier. If the robot’s grip is not tight enough, the cup will fall. So first, we had to find out how to make the robot grab carefully but tightly at the same time. And secondly, we had to develop recommendations for clients on the cup’s size and parameters. #### How well is the Rozum Café being accepted? Are you getting any negative reactions from the existing coffee market? The reaction from potential clients was positive. Automation was already in the air before the year 2020 arrived and made contactless service trendy. The USA market was maybe a bit more prepared than Europe, as some similar projects were launched here before (but were not available for purchase). In Europe, the autonomous robot barista is a novelty. We installed cafes in Emirates, Ukraine, and Belarus. The solution was also presented in tech and coffee contests in Russia. We’ve participated in exhibitions in other European countries. Many orders are in progress now. We believe this is a good result if you take into account that the first version of the café was presented less than a year ago. When describing robotic cafes, some writers use loud titles like ‘’Robot will steal baristas jobs’’. Such titles are misleading and made to grab your attention. Rozum Café will not eliminate human baristas or standard cafes with on-seat places. Our niche takes care of quick autonomous brewing of high-quality coffee. The visitors of Rozum Café are people who want to get their freshly brewed coffee quickly and want to be sure that it’s great coffee instead of the brown liquid from the vending coffee machine. Of course, in today’s situation, the coffee market is even more open to automation tools, as it is not only about speed and quality but also about safety. The owners of Rozum Cafe are people who want to start a coffee business quickly and with minimal time investments and remote control options. As I’ve already mentioned, when developing the café, we invited the human baristas to set up the coffee equipment. The robot repeats the movements that the barista would do, but espresso machine settings and grinder settings have to be tuned additionally. We deliver Rozum Cafe with pre-installed settings. The cafe owner can invite a star barista to change the settings and adjust the coffee taste to the clients’ preferences in the region. Robots have nothing to do with eliminating jobs. They have a lot to do with building partnerships and spreading good coffee service. Coffee culture has grown highly in the last 20 years. There are not as many great baristas as people who love great coffee. Why not see the robot barista as a solution to this problem?![pulling the espresso shot](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/pulling-the-shot2.D-B2ZoeI_Z16evir.webp) #### Since no barista can take an order verbally, how does one order and pay for a coffee drink? Does the customer need to download an app on their phone? In the standard version of the cafe, a client makes a few clicks on a 10 inch multi-language touchscreen. The system accepts payments by card or phone. For one of our clients, we’re developing an app as a part of a customized robot cafe.![ordering coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/order-coffee.CRUrbZOF_1WN9X9.webp) #### Whenever I make espresso, there are loose coffee grounds everywhere that require cleaning on the counter. I don’t see the robot cleaning in the video. Are there no loose grounds? How is the workspace kept clean? After each order, the robot takes the tamping holder and cleans it in the special dry cleaning system. The coffee grounds are collected in a special bag hidden inside the café. The café owner can then control how the used coffee grounds are recycled or reused. #### Does the Rozum offer different milk type choices? The standard package doesn’t include this option, but the system can work with some non-dairy kinds of milk. Each new milk type requires testing to make sure that the milk dispensers are working well, the time needed for good foaming doesn’t change, etc. Several milk options will be in the next Rozum Café update. #### In cafes, baristas need to tighten or loosen the grinder when conditions change, such as humidity or the age of the beans. Is the Rozum system capable of adjusting the grinder in real-time if the espresso shots start pulling too fast or too slow? The Café is maintained once a day before the working day of the robot starts. The maintenance includes filling in supplements and checking the grinding and tamping settings. If there are any changes in the taste of coffee, the settings should be updated following the instructions we provide with each Rozum Café. #### Can the owner of a Rozum access any metrics remotely, not just on sales, but on water temperature and the speed of shots? If so, can they remotely make adjustments? No, now there is only remote access to all sales data and video access to the Rozum Café. So the owner can get a live view of the coffee station in 1900х1980p video on any device.![robot coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/shot-extraction.BlW0Apn0_22Rktl.webp) #### Are you working on any new features for the next version of the Rozum? In the nearest time, we plan to make the brewing/cup delivery process faster by up to 30%. We also plan to add audio and visual effects. For some clients, we work on the aforementioned double milk system, ice coffee system, etc. It’s essential to understand that we are primarily a robotics company, so if a client comes to us and says that it’s important that the robot adds two syrups at once, it’s part of our task to find out how to do this. #### Thank you for sharing your invention. The vision that we would like to share not only with our clients but also with end-users of Rozum Café, is that there is no need to be afraid of automation. It might seem strange at the beginning. It might seem unusual. But then it becomes a part of our daily lives, just like cars or gadgets. Robotics makes comfort and great quality available for a wider range of people. ### Video Demonstration [Rozum Café.

# Meet the Roaster: Interview with Jesse Nelson of Conduit Coffee [Coffee People](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/coffee-people/)---by [Joseph Robertson](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/joseph-robertson/)![Meet the Roaster: Interview with Jesse Nelson of Conduit Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/meet-the-roaster-interview-with-jesse-nelson-of-conduit-coffee/conduit-coffee-jesse1.jpg)_This interview took place on July 13, 2013, between Jesse Nelson of Conduit Coffee and Joseph Roberston of Extracted Magazine._### The Studio**Joseph:** So, sitting here with Jesse at the Conduit Coffee studio, actually I was thinking about that on the way, how you call it a studio, which is pretty awesome because there’s a lot of art and craft.**Jesse:** Right, we like calling it a studio partly because its artsy, it makes sense, we do a lot of networking, it’s really just kind of active space centered around our little coffee business.**Joseph:** And you’ve had parties here, you have people visit, you have your Tuesday open house?**Jesse:** Yea we do the open houses and the parties are a lot of fun, what is really cool is we are also supporting a couple of nonprofits by providing space for them to have meetings here as well so we can cater that and it’s a nice sort of professional place where they can come, they have a table, we can bring food and we have all of the facilities here for that, it’s kind of fun to bring in other ideas and other good people that aren’t necessary related to the coffee world who come and appreciate what we are doing here.![Jesse Nelson](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/conduit-coffee-jesse1.CYhSH3Mw_Z28UDah.webp) ### Hawaiian Coffee**Joseph:** I like that. Before we get into talking about the nonprofits because I didn’t think about that but that’s cool, we are sitting here with Jesse’s brew of something, what am I drinking?**Jesse:** Let me taste it first and I’ll tell you. This is a peaberry from Hawaii, from a region near Kona, it’s a direct trade, actually, a family friend that retired and bought a farm in Hawaii, that may be the last of it, I think they are selling it because of health issues this year, but it’s nice, it’s a really nice coffee and it’s been fun to watch him grow, you can really see instantly the quality of the coffee beans when out there, less broken beans so as their business grew, it was fun to see that over the course of the last year. Hawaiian coffee is really nice and smooth, not remarkable, I shouldn’t say that on recording, David this is the best coffee I’ve ever had, I love you, thank you ha-ha.**Joseph:** It is delicious on initial impressions, I have been drinking a lot of coffee lately that has really outstanding fascinating notes to it, the other day I went to Ballard Coffee Works and I had a siphon of some Ethiopian coffee which had notes of blueberry to it, and it tasted like I was walking through a field of blueberries which was remarkable.**Jesse:** You can taste that landscape and you instantly get that image in your head of where this is growing. Coffee like this is something that Americans are generally used to, the kind of smooth full-bodied coffee and that’s why Hawaiian coffee has captured that marketing, it’s interesting because it’s grown over 1200 feet versus 1200 meters or more, so it’s really low altitude and they have an ongoing growing season there with the weather patterns that move in and move out on a very consistent basis so the beans are big, even these peaberries are a lot bigger than the other beans I get.**Joseph:** Is that due to the altitude?**Jesse:** I think that and I’d love to dive into this more with a biologist but I think that it is just that they grow easier so the beans are larger because there is more availability of sunlight and moisture versus the little tiny beans in Peru or the high altitude areas that are small because they have to struggle that much more to get that through.**Joseph:** That makes sense.**Jesse:** That’s also why you tend to get much more bright and fruity coffees from higher altitudes because there is that much more packed in there and much more effort, just like wine berries, you don’t want a wine berry to just grow and grow and grow to be big and juicy, you want them to be dense and sweet, so it’s the same concept.![Jesse roasting](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/jesse-roasting.C4STYjVz_Z1InEDX.webp) ### About Conduit**Joseph:** That’s an interesting point, I never thought about that. So Jesse, Conduit Coffee, what brought you here? Perhaps a short two-minute version of who you are and what brought you here and why conduit.**Jesse:** Conduit is a name I have used as an internet handle for a while in various forms and it’s something I took upon myself when I was an undergrad working with Paul Dixon, doing that stuff was just a conduit for information, I had a website called _PolitiConduit_ which was just a _Drudge Report_, a filter for news that I found interesting and relevant and I put it in orders and sent it out. It wasn’t like I was producing my own news but it was a conduit for information for people so that’s where it took off and then I was working with agriculture in Washington state, doing single development and alternative energy in agriculture communities and started roasting coffee. The agriculture side of coffee and the agriculture side of fine organic vegetables are very similar in a lot of ways, with a lot of the same challenges and marketing and pressures from business, so they really went hand in hand, I burned out on the politics, it was really frustrating to see these beautiful people and these farms, all these great ideas that just weren’t getting funded by the government or weren’t getting looked over by banks because they weren’t sexy enough with multimillion dollars or things like that, they were looking for 10 thousand dollars to help the family by buying a small piece of land and some farming tools, that just doesn’t sell to the banks. So I took off, went to Europe and farmed in Sicily and just really went on a coffee tour, decided after a few months that I was going to try out roasting more professionally and came back, backpacked in Colorado for a while then decided I better get back to work, I had taken about two years off from the world and sort of had a vision and a goal, at least to experiment with it, and suddenly I had some investment money. I found this space when I got some checks in the mail, kept the roaster small and the space small because at that point it very much was an experiment. I had done some work with roasters in Colorado, helping them bag and all the tedious parts of coffee roasting, beautiful coffee is easy to do, it’s the bagging and cleaning and the sales and marketing that’s the struggle. That’s definitely been the hardest part, but it was an experiment. So I bought this small roaster and just did everything ourselves, as much as we could by ourselves, here we are. The name Conduit was part of that goal of just sharing what we know and what we don’t know about coffee and food and also knowing that coffee is a catalyst for sitting around and talking and stimulating the mind.**Joseph:** Sitting next to this nice little sign here, it says “Be a Conduit”, I like that.**Jesse:** Yeh that’s all we want people to be, just start sharing what you love, share what you don’t love, the more we communicate and bring stuff to the table, the better the world will be and the more interactive we will be so that’s a part of the name.![be a Conduit](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/be-a-conduit.B6G-RQT6_Z19wV9.webp)**Joseph:** I was curious because I noticed on your bags, on the bags that you sell the coffee in, you have roasted kindly. That I think is a pretty neat touch, it says a lot to me, but I’m curious what brought you to put that.**Jesse:** Honestly I’m not quite sure, we had a lot of funny little things and we still put some Cracker Jack surprises on some of the bags, I had a sample at one point, it just said roasted kindly and the date and people loved it, so when we got the bags printed we put it on there in a more profound place, really it’s just kindness and appreciation for where the coffee is coming from, who’s drinking it and anything in between, so saying that we are roasting it kindly I think just touches that, it’s a marketing technique that just touches people and lets them know that we are putting care into this and that we notice every single batch and we are very hands-on, you don’t make nice anything if you’re angry. ### Roasting**Joseph:** So the studio, a pretty small space, in a previous issue, March I think, we had chatted. Before this time I knew nothing about roasting, I have a little bit of a better idea, but could you walk us through roasting and I guess because your space is so small and your roaster is so small, I feel like that brings out a very specific…**Jesse:** I figured that it might be the mud that’s seeping through the walls, we started off just in that little room there, 284 square feet, that’s small. It’s all part of one organ so when that fan kicks on to that roaster at 352 feet per minute, where’s that air going to come from and so we have to have another fan coming through from the hillside to the roof, and the hillside used to be an unincorporated jungle, all that air is coming from the roof and the trees so every little weather pattern and humidity change, it all ends up back in this room. We have a dehumidifier and we try and keep the humidity consistent, I believe it’s the most important but there are also temperature changes so from the moment I walk in, I walked in this morning and it was 16 degrees in this room, it’s just this habit of going in and thinking this is what the beans are basically going to do because the temperature and humidity are not at certain points, that’s all part of the roasting game. Keep stuff as clean as you can, there is always wiping down the buckets and sweeping, weighing down the coffee, then into the roaster, it takes a while to get that all warmed up. Do you want to know about the physical process?**Joseph:** No just an overview of the whole roasting process, I see bags of green coffee there, and then you have buckets of roasted coffee.**Jesse:** For anybody that’s listening, I really recommend some awesome videos on YouTube, there’s a video of one bean being roasted over a Bunsen burner and it talks about the physical changes that the bean is going through real close on the camera. So essentially you put the green beans in when they are at room temperature, they go into the hopper then into the hot drum, we use a drum buster, that’s going in and that’s hot, you put the beans in. What’s really cool about roasting is that there are very distinct stages of the roast that follow very specific changes in the physical reaction and what’s going on with the water, the moisture content, the acids and the fats in the beans, all those changes and all those have very scientific base points where those changes start to take place. When you see these changes you know that this is what’s happening with the bean, that’s why the sight and smell are so important with roasting when watching and paying attention, it’s not just a clock and timer and set it to go, that’s one reason why we have a fully manual roaster, it’s very hands-on, it’s also a lot cheaper than buying the computer package that goes with it. There’s a lot of consistency that can come from a computer control but it also takes away that element of trying to figure out what’s going on and learning, every time I roast I learn something new. So there are two coffee cracks when roasting coffee, essentially the first crack is an endothermic reaction when it’s like popcorn popping in the water, the vapors are finally expressed from the beans and that’s at that point when coffee becomes edible, you can start grinding it and they go from green and yellow stages, they hit a crack and that’s when you know the coffee is going to be edible. When you have very light roasted coffees they are cut off pretty much at first crack or during it. From there it gets darker and darker, when you get up a couple of minutes later you hit the second crack which is an exothermic reaction and that’s actually the creation of new oils and new acids in the roasting process, it’s from the heat combination, essentially its creating its own reaction, from that point is generally considered a dark roast, you keep going and those oils start coming out, you get the French roast, that’s also where fires start because with that exothermic reaction, if you have too big a batch or the power goes out or something like that, or you’re careless, that’s a lot of heat in an exothermic reaction that you can’t stop. You can’t open up the roaster and stop the drum because that’s just going to create more heat, there are a lot of roaster fires coming from that.**Joseph:** So you mention dark roast and French roast, I think there are a couple of different understandings of what that is? To clarify, how does your coffee and your scale of light to dark compare to say Starbucks for example?**Jesse:** Starbucks isn’t really a fair example, its economics when you get to roasting in that volume, I try and do a well-developed light roast, often right after the first crack but I give it some time to sit there and play depending on the coffee but sit there and play and let the sugars develop because that first crack is the caramelization stage where the sugars are starting to caramelize and that’s when you get that sweetness in the cup. It’s also where the acids start toning down a little bit, so for espressos, you want to get a little bit deeper into that roast so they are not quite as bright, theoretically, but everyone is doing something different now as far as what they want. So we take a long time, I usually hit the first crack around 9 minutes in, and then I cut the roaster, the earliest would be around 11 minutes 45 seconds, that’s a really quick light roast for us, I go as long as 16 minutes on out darker roast usually in the middle of the second crack. So we don’t even go with dark as a French roast on our dark beans but we take a long time to get there, it’s very Italian, practically northern Italian style just letting it slowly evaporate, you’re not doing any harsh curves with the beans.**Joseph:** Which coffees do you have that you roast darkly, past the second crack?**Jesse:** Our Studio Style blend. I do some other custom roasts for friends that want that darker Italian style roast but really personally I enjoy the flavors that are more natural in the coffee, there is some really cool sweetness that you can play with right at that edge of roasting. So with Starbucks, they are almost 300 million pounds a year, tremendous, it’s an unfathomed amount of coffee that we drink and that one company can produce and so they have these roasters when you are looking at the difference between 6 minutes or 15 minutes on a roast, you are looking at the difference of twice as many BTU’s, twice as many labor hours, twice as much time and energy and money that has to go into that same product, so if you take your beans and roast them quickly and efficiently, you get a more consistent product, you also save a lot of time and money when you are talking that kind of volume. Starbucks does what we are doing here but with a tremendous amount of labor costs, so their roast curve is a ski slope, get as much heat in there as quickly as possible, I believe they roast for about 9 minutes to get to that dark, that’s almost twice as fast.**Joseph:** Same amount of time but far more roasted.**Jesse:** Yes so they are reaching the first crack around about 6 minutes in, it’s a big difference, sometimes about going darker I think a lot of the history of that has just been the coffee itself hasn’t been that quality and why put the effort in to bring out the new notes of whatever farm they are from if they are not tasty, you are much better off taking the natural sugars and getting it to that caramelization because then it’s a consistent product and its cheaper.![Coffee roasting](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/coffee-roasting.thChNUgC_14ustD.webp) ### Green Coffee**Joseph:** So speaking of the green coffee, where do you get yours?**Jesse:** I work very closely with an importer, some friends of mine, they are absolutely wonderful to me, but we get coffee from all over, there are certain areas that I am not a huge fan personally so I have to eat it a little bit and get coffee that I don’t enjoy too much or roast it which I don’t think I’ll enjoy but then I get surprised. So we have some new Sumatrans, speaking of coffee which I don’t ordinarily enjoy, some good musky island coffee but it’s such an important piece of the dark roast that a lot of people are expecting. I haven’t really found any Sumatrans lately that have impressed me so I’m really excited we are going to get some of those in a couple of weeks here. We have had Ethiopian, Rwandan, and Kenyan coffees, part of our espresso blend is a Rwandan, central, and South American coffees, and we have a New Mexican coffee, twelve Salvador’s.**Joseph:** How closely do you work with the farms? I noticed you have stories of the farms over here for some of your coffee but you work with the importer.**Jesse:** I work with the importer who works very closely with the farmers, the direct trade is an area which, as a traveler, fascinates me, I would absolutely love for the business to get to the point where I do travel to go to these places, we certainly can’t afford it as a business right now and there is nobody else that is roasting. So I can’t go off and try and meet these farmers, honestly, I think it’s really important that the stories are being told and people are recognizing that which is great, it’s just as important for me to share their story as it is for me to create my own story about those farmers, trusting my importer who is doing good work with these farmers, I know a little bit of their story but I don’t think their trade is particularly important as an activity for a roasting company, telling the story is certainly important but actually meeting the farmers who bring that in, it’s a marketing thing in a lot of ways. On the other hand, if you have money going down there and building schools, replacing bridges, all that stuff is absolutely wonderful, that’s so much more than just knowing the farmer and buying coffee from them, that’s actually a two-way learning experience and training people and it is very much a co-operative thing, it’s much more than just trading with them for coffee, so I think it’s so much more than just a direct trade, what they are doing is beautiful, its micro-lending and development work. That’s probably the direction that I would like to go just to go hang out in Guatemala for a few months. So we get our coffee from all over, I said that Hawaiian is direct trade and that’s fortunate that we know the farmer, I do know the farmer from one of our Guatemalans just from the coffee industry, he has worked with the importer for long enough and now his coffee is nice enough he is selling it as a single order and so I’ve known him just because he has been to Seattle a few times. That’s a cool relationship, we are friends on Facebook and his daughter’s soccer team won the Central Americans youth cup. It’s fun knowing that stuff about him when it’s totally irrelevant to the coffee but it’s also a resource I can go and say what’s going on with the rust in Guatemala and he sent back this heartbreaking story of him and his neighbors and the rust.**Joseph:** Is that affecting you?**Jesse:** It will, we are looking at a 40% cut in all central American coffees next year across the board, everybody, I asked my importer what’s going on with the rust and she said F you for asking, do you want me to tell you you’re not going to have any central American coffees next year, that was it, it’s scary, they are panicking, they specialize in central American coffees too because their own business does that but that’s a really frightening thing for the whole coffee world and nobody really knows what’s going to happen. I wouldn’t be surprised if prices double in some ways next year.**Joseph:** I have personally been on Ethiopian kick lately so…**Jesse:** I love Ethiopian coffees. We’ve talked about this before but the bright fruity coffees are absolutely fascinating to me, the first time I had a cup of coffee that I roasted myself I was like that’s blueberries and cream this is amazing and it’s just the excitement that comes from that it’s much more, I get more excited about that than this Hawaiian even though this is delicious.**Joseph:** There are some interesting videos and articles on the origin of coffee and how Ethiopia being the origin of coffee has thousands of different varietals but how I guess most of the rest of the coffee in the world essentially originated from one point.**Jesse:** Coffee is fairly easy to hybridize. Ethiopia I believe has 12,000 known species of coffee that they have found in Ethiopia and really we use 32 different species for commercial production in the world, most of that is the top 6, and a lot of that is because of how much coffee they grow per plant, how big the plants are, how easy they are to harvest and where they grow best, there are hybrids now they are creating which grow really well in certain conditions and that’s interesting how that’s happening.**Joseph:** Getting back to the roasting aspect of things, you have a Bolivia coffee, a Bolivian roast I had a couple of months ago was fantastic but I guess you made some changes, was it changes on your end, or did you get a different bag.**Jesse:** No it’s the same bag of coffee I believe.**Joseph:** But it tasted so different.**Jesse:** I didn’t know if people could really notice the difference tremendously, maybe if you put them side by side, but that’s what’s fun about my little shop that it doesn’t matter if they notice or not because it’s part of the story that we are telling, beans aren’t the same, the weather is different, things like that. I had an epiphany actually, you know I said I learn stuff every single time I roast, I was reading up on some ideas I had about airflow and changing the airflow, I started researching some of that, and a lot of times these things strike me as a new metaphor, a new language that I am hearing, new words to describe what’s going on, it was like oh my gosh this is what I should do on some of these coffees, this is a way to bring us these much fruitier assets that make those lighter notes. So I adjusted the profile, the Bolivia is fun because it’s a really nice sweet coffee but has some really nice fruit notes in it too. It’s pretty good as a darker roast as well. I almost reversed the curve, I put a lot more heat earlier in it and less at the end, adjusted the airflow and it was beautiful, the first roast I did I could smell the difference when it came out and I made four different roasts that day, put them all side by side and you could definitely taste the difference which is fascinating that its literally just 2 degrees and ten seconds different, it’s just where that heat is entering and where that air flow is entering, makes all the difference to how that heat transfers into it and when changing how that heat gets in there makes a huge difference at the end so if you can get that heat locked in there and roast quickly, you’ve created a nice coffee whereas if you let it dry out and go long, it flattens it basically which is not necessarily a bad thing.**Joseph:** It’s really fascinating this combination of art and science.**Jesse:** I call it superstition and I get a lot of criticism for using that word so much including last night. There is so much science that goes into this and so many known scientific properties of the physics of heat transfer and the chemistry of those things changing with heat and all that stuff is very well known but what isn’t known which there are a lot of rules of thumb for are when that happens and what the telltale signs are, then you get to a room like this where the humidity and the temperature changes and stuff like that, there are so many variables that could possibly go into that roast that yes you know that this reaction is going to happen at this degree but that degree might be 25 seconds later, there are so many variables that go into it that a lot of what we perceive and enjoy about coffee is actually just superstition that they either make a big difference or they don’t, people are going to notice it. So when I buy the green coffee, one of the bags was torn open so the beans were spilling out which is fine, it’s like I wonder if that’s going to make a difference, I roast it, and its pouring with rain but its muggy and humid so it’s a totally different variable. If someone is talking to me and I miss the temperature by two seconds or ten seconds, whatever, all that comes out and the beans look fine, they taste great, then you can’t really notice the difference, you get them over to a coffee shop and brew them on 125 PSI at 202 degrees on an espresso machine which is going to extract all those differences and it may end up in a cup that wasn’t washed fully, there are so many variables that go into that fine cup of coffee at the end, you can’t possibly plan for all that so there’s a lot of superstition that defines, it is what it is and if you possibly try and control that, you’re never going to relax and never going to enjoy the coffee for what it is as an organic agricultural product.![Jesse by coffee roaster](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/jesse-by-roaster.DiDg0F7w_Z20Tzxz.webp) ### Roasting Trends**Joseph:** Whenever I am drinking a cup of coffee I always like to think about the person who sat there and nurtured the beans and created this roast and to be its an artistic process like you say, all that stuff is just another world to me so I imagine like Mickey Mouse in his wizard outfit and then a roast comes out. This is something I’ve been pondering when I’m sitting there in a cafe, how can I look at the coffee I’m drinking, what about that cup that I’m drinking is from the roaster, so much of the cup comes from the person who’s been preparing it too.**Jesse:** You can notice the difference, my color has been getting better as I’ve been roasting more and drinking a lot of coffee, you can start to tell the difference as to whether it’s a roaster air or a barista air, if it tastes grainy then it’s probably a dirty filter from the barista.**Joseph:** Even not just airs but character.**Jesse:** I think a lot of what you taste assuming the cup is prepared nicely and timely, there is personality in a roaster as to how much they want to do. Traditionally coffee has been roasted dark and we’ve talked about why, the economics, now that farmers are getting more involved because of these direct trade relationships they are learning what the American and northern European markets really want, now they are started to cater their farming operations to grow higher quality beans to get into that because they would make so much more money, rather selling for $1.30 per pound they can sell it to coffee importers for $4-$5 per pound, so much more money goes to the farmers and its better for the whole industry for people to be drinking higher quality coffee, it improves the lives of everybody in between. The new theme of roasters is to go really light and preserve the natural beauty of the farm. That’s a trend, the whole industry is changing by any means, you can taste that when you get that light fruity cup and you think that’s delicious, a lot of that is the beans, they’ve just brought enough heat to accent those natural flavors, they’re not actually putting too much of the fingerprint from the roaster on that. I really appreciate that it’s difficult, that’s a tough market to sell, and it challenges what people are used to in coffee.**Joseph:** Do you think that roasters should be invisible in the process?**Jesse:** Personally no, I think the roaster has all the right in the world to make the imprint on the coffee, it’s up to the roaster to decide, some coffees are better, some aren’t, depending on how much effort you want, how much you want to adjust that. I like calling our coffee a well-developed light roast because I really like the natural flavors but there are some really nice sugars that come out when roasting coffee, it’s not from the farm, you are actually caramelizing sugars in the roasting process, that’s where a lot of body and things like that come from. For me, I don’t like to put too much of an imprint on it but in a way, I’m putting a huge imprint on it because I see that there are these sugars that I really want to accent and that’s what I’m going to do, it’s beyond the natural bean and we don’t go too dark at all so to me maybe I’m putting more of an imprint on the dark roast, it’s like the physical roaster itself putting the imprint on the bean versus the roaster, the human that’s roasting the coffee.**Joseph:** I end up getting a lot of coffee just in the stuff that I do, people give me coffee or I just go and buy a lot of coffee and try them out but when I get a bag of Conduit versus a bag of Kuma for example, maybe if I was blindfolded I wouldn’t be able to tell, but I can smell a bag of Conduit and know that its Conduit, I don’t know why that is but I can just tell, it’s very distinct.**Jesse:** _Kuma Coffee_ is wonderful coffee, he is kind of a hero of mine, he does well to develop light roasts but they are really light and I don’t know what he does, but it’s a different roaster, he is not doing infra-red heat, the thing with real light coffee versus anything darker is that it takes longer for those gases to degas, there’s not quite as many of them and it hasn’t been developed long enough to release those in the roasting process so that’s why when you get the real dark stuff, you think that’s some pungent coffee. Those are the aromatics that come out of roasting, a lot of times I recommend letting the coffee sit. I reckon the Bolivian coffee is great after 2 weeks, it just gets time to settle down and relax and the Co2 is out of it.**Joseph:** I definitely notice the difference, I came in last week or the week before and I got a bag of Bolivian, the day after you roasted it and it had a very amazing aroma to it. But it changed, it’s still amazing but different.**Jesse:** What’s fascinating is actually this Hawaiian coffee, it was some of the most amazing education in that regard, it was like ripe papaya when I first roasted it and within 4 days it was like this nice fruity papaya, and then a week later it was like it went off a cliff and hit this chocolaty smooth full body, I was like wow there is virtually no papaya fruitiness in that at all, it had all been gassed out. Maybe it’s more than the aromatics that I taste in my nose but it’s fascinating how that stuff changes. I was talking to a roaster who doesn’t roast anymore but he comes here and gives me pointers. He was fed up with clients because one client wanted 17 days out and they wanted him to roast every day and then hold the coffee for 17 days and then deliver it to him. He basically had to cut the difference and say we will hold it for 8 days and then you’re going to have to take it and hold it because they didn’t have room. It was a couple of hundred pounds per week. That’s a lot of coffee to be sitting on the shelf for 17 days. Some people get really particular when dealing with espresso. It is really good to let the coffee age a little bit before you put it in espresso so you’re getting the full coffee and not the gases. ### Espresso and Coffee Fest 2012**Joseph:** Speaking of espresso, we haven’t talked about your Locofocos.**Jesse:** Locofocos is a silly name and people don’t often want to say it so I just want to explain real quick, everybody please just look it up, type in locofocos on Wikipedia, and you will see the first line is that it is a radical wing of the Democratic Party in the 1800s and I came across that term in graduate school and thought I’m going to name my espresso blend that. That was in 2007. There were people who were big Democrats and they were challenging the gas companies and they were pro-labor and pro-union and they were getting bullied around in New York city so when they shut off the gas light during their protest they would use candles and they got names the crazy lights, the Locofocos. That’s why it’s kind of a radical idea that goes into this, just for the record locofocos is an awesome concept. The word was really fun, the competition was, I really enjoyed it, and there is a lot of criticism…![Locofocus Espresso](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/locofocus-espresso.ZhRn-soZ_Z12zQFp.webp)**Joseph:** This was America’s best espresso competition?**Jesse:** Yes at Coffee Fest 2012. They had a call out to roasters who want to be a part of that so we signed up and did a little spiel and got into the 32 they picked in the western region, there were a lot of funny things in the competition that they could plan out better, but there was a tournament-style bracket system and there weren’t points associated with it so it wasn’t like all the judges tasted all the coffees and the one with the highest points won, it was totally informal head to head like your shots are better, your shots are better, and you just move through the bracket system like a tournament. It’s silly in the coffee world, there are no real bragging rights in there, and there’s nothing to lose. Because there were no points and it was a brackets system, you may be a roaster over there and I’m a roaster over here and you got bumped out by whoever, they move forward, it doesn’t mean their coffee is better than yours, there wasn’t anything to lose by joining this thing, it was just about how many times they were going to say our name over a microphone. Then it turned out we had pretty good espresso and we went all the way through and got second place, what I liked about it is the top 4 were no-name roasters, none of the bigs made it in. Some got knocked out right away and all these big names get really finicky and they didn’t get through it. The whole tournament itself made all these people mad because they didn’t win and they weren’t recognized and they think they make great coffee which they do, it really highlighted the community aspect of it, the whole scene at Coffee Fest was really fun, everyone was cheering and hugging, it was great. Never did I think we were going to do as well as we did, made us a lot busier of a weekend because for so long we had to rearrange all of our schedules to be there.**Joseph:** I was there but I wasn’t paying attention to that competition as much but it was pretty wild. Did they just taste the espresso straight?**Jesse:** Yep, and there’s a time limit to my friend Cole went and pulled shots, there were three judges so they were each given a shot of espresso, and in the first round, there were a lot of roasters on, they each had 6 minutes to get in there, do what was needed and pull the shots, the second days we had 10 minutes which was really funny, Cole was there and he would pull a shot, smell it, taste it, lick it, throw it away and pull another one, he used over 20 cups in 10 minutes, 20 single shots of espresso, he would taste one and think that’s good than hand it to one judge then pull another one and then do the same process over and over because he is just so smooth, that’s probably mostly why we won back then, superstition, it wasn’t just our espresso, we had this awesome character pulling our shots for us.**Joseph:** I remember listening to you just talking about espresso because I think your Locofocos has gone through some changes since then but listening to you talking about balancing the bright flavors and also the ability to work well with milk which is not something I ever think about.**Jesse:** A good espresso blend is the bread and butter of coffee roasting, that’s what sells volumes, you can love all your single light coffees as much as you want but how many are you going to sell, rarely are you going to find a client that will by 40 pounds of organic Bolivian coffee a week, it doesn’t really happen, shops aren’t that big and the industry isn’t really there yet. An espresso blend that works well with milk has enough body to carry through on a latte, you have to have that so I like to think in terms of profiles, coffee is an agricultural product and we are a small roasting operation with limited money so we cannot possibly buy all the coffee and keep the blend consistent. Plus it’s really boring, what’s fun about having a blend that’s always the same and doesn’t have the ability to change with the industry. Our Locofocos is actually two different roasts that I blend back together, there is a lighter portion and a darker portion and I use a natural process. So we have this profile where our lighter portion is definitely on the well-developed light roast side but that gives a nice acidic nuttiness to it and I don’t have a particularly bright coffee in that role, so it’s not going to be super free, I don’t want to surprise people too much. Having that lighter portion that gives a lot of vibrant character in an Americano or a single shot of espresso and then we have the darker portion that is brought up just about 45 seconds away from the second crack, the beans are just about to show a tiny bit of oil, that’s where we go with the darker portion, it gives a little bit of freeness to it, then I blend it all back together so you get this nice mixture of the two. All in all, they are not too far apart, you don’t want to have the inconsistencies between shots of espressos that you are pulling, so yes our espresso changes because the coffee changes, pretty much guaranteed to all of our clients that our espresso profile is going to be the same, there will be a lighter portion and a darker portion, we will bring it to the height of sweetness in the lighter realm, the height of the body in the darker realm and put it back together and trust us, it will be fine. It’s very hands-on, I definitely wouldn’t want to experiment with a new blend, and I may hand out a lot of samples of it to other cafes and get their feedback and see if they are interested in it. We had a really nice Ethiopian that was super fruity and like walking in a blueberry field and that was the version after the competition, people liked it but it surprised a lot of people so when the Ethiopian ran out, I replaced it with this Rwandan which is much more savory, it’s like a meaty protein sort of taste. It adds a nice standard espresso body to the whole thing, since then people love it, it’s one of those learning things.![Conduit coffee stamp](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/conduit-coffee-stamp.DVUzX5-8_B8MKY.webp) ### Final Words**Joseph:** I feel like we could talk forever. Shall we wrap up with what is your favorite coffee that you have roasted thus far with Conduit?**Jesse:** As far as big bags of coffee go, I love this Bolivian, the learning process and the quality of the coffee, even the bag, and the bags just seem vibrant colorful bags.**Joseph:** We will come back and get some pictures.**Jesse:** Look online too, we have pictures of the bags next to our beans but the Bolivian is beautiful. I’ve had a few absolutely remarkable coffees including a Kenyan, you had some of that as an espresso a couple of weeks ago, or maybe you were out of town.**Joseph:** Right before I left you had a box of something roasted that I got a bag of, I can’t remember what it was. It wasn’t a Kenyan but it was absolutely remarkable. I wish I could remember.**Jesse:** That’s the fun part about this is that it changes all the time. There are some beautiful coffees, and as we grow we have more money and figure out our routines more and the roasters get broken.**Joseph:** Jesse, Conduit Coffee, It’s been fun.**Jesse:** It’s been really fun, I love this, really appreciate it, Joseph.

# Meeting The Roaster: Arne Holt of Caffé Calabria [Coffee People](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/coffee-people/)---by [Barbara Zaragoza](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/barbara-zaragoza/)![Meeting The Roaster: Arne Holt of Caffé Calabria](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/meeting-the-roaster-arne-holt-of-caffe-calabria/roaster-check-beans550.jpg) ### Turning San Diego into a coffee capital, one roast at a time. “Roasting coffee is a culinary art,” says Arne Holt, owner of Caffé Calabria in North Park. With ten different blends sold to 150 grocery stores and cafes, Arne runs not only a wholesale roasting company but also a popular cafe. Arne started out with a coffee cart at Grossmont Hospital in 1991. Born and raised in Seattle where a coffee cart stood on every street corner, Arne spent many years in the food business before coming down to San Diego. He noticed the city had no coffee culture at the time, so he wanted to break open the business. Once he established his coffee cart, he tried his hand at roasting. “My coffee turned out terrible,” Arne recalls. By 1995 he expanded, opening another cart in Mission Valley as well as a wholesale roasting factory downtown. That’s when he realized that he’d have to take roasting as a serious art form. “Think of it as a concerto where all the flavors and aromatics have to come together in perfect harmony,” Arne says. When beans roast, more than 800 reactions happen at once. The process is so complicated that even scientists are at a lack to explain it. Roasting is an art form. Either you’ve got it, or you don’t.![cappuccino](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/cappuccino5501.CsB4xDbs_1zNi1S.webp) The passion Arne had for coffee roasting paid off. By 2001 he opened up his 14,000 square foot space that now includes thirty employees, a roasting factory, and a cafe, which, since a year ago, turns into a Neapolitan pizza restaurant in the evenings. The entire cafe is made from authentic Italian items. An apple-pie American, Arne loves everything Italian and has visited the country more than twenty-five times. His favorite place is the Amalfi Coast and to prove it, a muralist painted the hotel where he often stays as well as a barista serving coffee.![amalfi-mural](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/amalfi-mural550.BVs_6yFT_Z1FQp7a.webp) Whenever Arne visits Italy, he buys items for the cafe. His cups, saucers, water glasses, knives, and spoons are all imported from Italy. At the back wall, he uses Italian olive oil tins for his juices. The bar is made of Italian tiles, and he also has an elegant wine collection on display. Behind glass windows, customers can also catch a glimpse of Arne’s twenty batches of coffee roasted every day, five days a week. (That comes out to about 10,000 pounds of coffee per week.) Arne shows me the entire roasting process, which takes about twenty minutes. But “the finish time isn’t important,” he explains, “it’s how you get there.”![probat-coffee-roaster](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/probat-coffee-roaster550.DvrL5nss_2vcX8w.webp) He buys the raw green beans from brokers in San Francisco. When they arrive on palettes, the beans are weighed and placed in a hopper. For Arne’s house blend, he uses Sumatra beans as the foundation. That provides the low notes, and importantly, the beans don’t have a lot of acidity. For the medium notes, he uses Central and South American beans to bring some brightness and sweetness. Finally, he mixes in Ethiopian beans that provide the ‘high notes’ with hints of citrus. The bean mix must be blended just right so that one flavor doesn’t overwhelm the other.![check beans roaster](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/roaster-check-beans550.4wuf7Esp_Z4dMM8.webp) An air conveyor vacuums the beans into an overhead hopper. Then, the beans are charged into the roaster. They heat for about 5-6 minutes, which drives out the moisture, turning the beans from a green to cinnamon color. The beans begin to crackle, called the ‘first crack’. That’s when the fiber inside the beans is released. The roaster must watch the time, and the temperature and pull the tier from the roasting machine to check the color of the beans. He adds and takes away heat to develop the flavors based on what he observes. After the first crack, the beans go quiet for just a little bit. A ‘second crack’ then begins, and three reactions happen at once: the development of lipids, the release of gases, and the caramelization of sugars. Arne explains that roasting coffee is about the caramelization of sugar, which can’t happen too quickly or too slowly. The lighter the roast, the less sugars are caramelized, and you get a coffee that is bright, acidic, and even sour. When you create a darker roast, you’ll find the sweet spots. The first notes that come out of darker roasts are nutty, then caramel, then chocolate. Arne’s ‘gold standard’ is reaching the chocolate notes. When the beans are finished, the roasting machine opens quickly, and the beans spill into a vat, where they are rotated for about five minutes. A fan underneath blows to cool the beans evenly.![Coffee roaster cooling](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/coffee-roaster-cooling.tDvGF-_I_1Nc1oH.webp) Every morning, Arne and his team take several batches of beans and test them upstairs to the cupping room. They taste coffee with a spoon and pull it through their palate to see if the blend meets their standards. You can have excellent beans and a well-crafted roast, Arne says, but if the barista doesn’t know how to have the water hit the coffee just right (for either espresso or drip) then the coffee cup won’t come out well. All three have to work together to create an excellent cup of coffee. Arne has plans for exporting his blends to Asia and expanding his cafes to other parts of San Diego, but he also has to convince cafe owners to learn the craft of making a good-tasting cup. San Diego isn’t a coffee capital – yet. But if anyone can turn that around, Arne has the vision and patience to make it happen. ### Resources [Caffé Calabria](https://caffecalabria.com/) – Caffé Calabria is located at 3933 30th Street, San Diego, CA 92104.

# Meeting Up With The Green Coffee Buying Club [Roasting Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/roasting-coffee/)---by [Michael Allen Smith](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/michael-allen-smith/)![Meeting Up With The Green Coffee Buying Club](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/meeting-up-with-the-green-coffee-buying-club/The-Green-Coffee-Buying-Club.jpg) While researching the economics of home coffee roasting, I wanted to learn more about a green coffee buying cooperative. Green bean coffee cooperatives are groups that pool their money together to buy sizes of unroasted coffee that are usually only available to commercial roasters. Fortunately, I knew that INeedCoffee contributor Chris Arnold was active with the _Green Coffee Buying Club_. He agreed to an email interview.**INEEDCOFFEE:** When did the Green Coffee Buying Club start?**Chris Arnold:** The _Green Coffee Buying Club_ started approximately April 2005. It started out of a desire for a laid-back approach to getting great coffee at lower prices. Thus the motto, “_Splitting bags of Green Coffee, and have fun doing it._”**INC:** What is your role with the site?**Chris:** I mainly handle the technical side of things. I maintain the website, technical support, user permissions, etc. However, I also am one of four other founding members. We all discuss certain site-wide (and even user-specific) issues that come up from time to time, and always come up with a game plan that is agreeable to all. We always try to do what is best and try to maintain a few goals such as keeping the site ad-free.**INC:** How many members are there?**Chris:** We currently have upwards of 3,000 members, but in the past, we were more aggressive with deleting inactive users. Had we not done that, I suspect we would have somewhere around 8,000-10,000 members. We have never advertised, and I don’t even think we come up in many Google searches. Bear in mind that most of our free membership is from word of mouth.![Open bag of green coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/large-bag-of-green-coffee1.Ccm67sgZ_1rMizi.webp)_Open bag of green coffee_**INC:** Do you have any recent examples of pricing and quality?**Chris:** We get a wide variety of specialty grade coffees, as well as COE (Cup of Excellence) coffee. Pricing can be as little as $2 per pound on an Ethiopian, on up to $20+ on something like a Jamaica Blue Mountain or COE. Most of the coffee is “Cupped” by our more experienced members, and based on that taste test, the decision is made whether to go forward or not. Point is, I have always gotten a good coffee and in most cases very good to excellent. We don’t want to distribute something that we don’t enjoy drinking ourselves.**INC:** Walk me through a typical transaction, from locating the beans to having the individual roaster receive his portion of the shipment.**Chris:** Several of our distributors maintain relationships with coffee importers, so they can get bulk pricing. Once a coffee of interest comes up on the position sheet of the importer or broker, the distributor makes a post in our “_Potential Offering_” area. This is simply to gauge interest. Once enough interest has been shown, then the post is moved to the “_Open Offering_” area where people can post firm commitments. Sometimes a prepayment is required, but in general, the honor system is pretty much the standard. The coffee usually comes into port cities in places like San Diego or even New York. The distributor may pick up the coffee or have it shipped to him. Once at his place, he will ship it to those who have paid, and from there, the buyer gets to enjoy some really great roasting sessions and the resulting coffee.**INC:** What can the home roaster expect to pay for a 5# or 10# order?**Chris:** Like in the retail world, prices fluctuate, but our entry point starts quite a bit lower. Also, since most shipments are done with US Postal Service Flat Rate boxes, your best price per pound will be when that box is maxed out. Most boxes hold between 10-15 pounds of Green (unroasted) Coffee. So a typical nice Ethiopian Harrar, for example, might come in at $2.50/lb. So on 15 lbs, the coffee is $37.50, shipping is about $10, and the “PayPal, insurance, & packaging fees” are about another $10. So $37.50 + $10 + $10 = $57.50/15 lbs = $3.83/lb, or about $4/lb in round numbers. That is a pretty good deal, considering most of the coffee we get is of very good quality. In the retail world, there is a lot of average or below-average coffee, not to mention old coffee that has been sitting on the shelves for some time.**INC:** Is there a certain type of home roaster that this club is best for?**Chris:** I think any level of home roaster can benefit from the GCBC. I have never been a fan of ordering 1 or 2 pounds of a given coffee, especially for beginners. They will burn through that before they even know how to roast it. That is why five or more pounds actually works out well (which is the typical minimum anyway on GCBC).**INC:** And is there a type that would be better off going through traditional stores?**Chris:** Traditional online stores are where most of us bought our first Green Coffee. So if you want to get your feet wet, retail is fine. However, as I said before, 1 pound is not enough to get a feel for a certain coffee. The only real advantage to a retail outlet is when they get that one special coffee, that nobody else can get. I think those situations are rare, but certainly, do come up.**INC:** How does one become a member?**Chris:** Very easy.

# Melitta Home Roasting Mishap [Roasting Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/roasting-coffee/)---by [Michael Allen Smith](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/michael-allen-smith/)![Melitta Home Roasting Mishap](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/melitta-mishap/smoke1.jpg) Last month, I located a Melitta AromaRoast Coffee Roaster on eBay. Even though I already have several other home roasters, I figured it would be fun to tackle a new one and, in the process, write up a roasting tutorial for INeedCoffee. My initial research told me that roasting in a Melitta AromaRoast would be more difficult than most roasting methods. What started as a roasting challenge almost burned my house down. But I’m getting ahead of myself. ### History The Melitta AromaRoast is an electric fluid-bed home coffee roaster. According to Kenneth Davids, the author of the home roaster’s bible Home Coffee Roasting, Revised, Updated Edition: Romance and Revival, the AromaRoast was imported by the Melitta Corporation from Hong Kong in the early 1980s. The roaster apparently infringed on the American patent holders, who successfully removed it from the consumer market. Even though you can no longer purchase an AromaRoast from the store, you can still find them occasionally on eBay or other auction sites. I ended up buying mine for around $30 with shipping.![melitta roaster](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/ma125x208.Ca_tBMBc_ZBQczS.webp)![melitta roaster box](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/box137x208.D8BQjlU2_1d5kE.webp) ### A Roasting Challenge One goal of home roasting is not to roast the beans too fast or too slow. If you roast too quickly, the beans won’t fully develop the flavors one associates with home-roasted coffee. On the other hand, if the beans take too long to roast, they are baked, which results in a very flat taste. The AromaRoast has a reputation for being underpowered. My first roast confirmed this. After 11 minutes of roasting, the beans still had a lightly roasted cinnamon hue. Another problem with the AromaRoast, besides its being underpowered, is that there is no way to monitor the roast visually. Other roasters such as the [Hearthware](https://ineedcoffee.com/home-roasting-with-the-hearthware-precision/) and the [Fresh Roast](https://ineedcoffee.com/home-roasting-coffee-with-the-fresh-roast/) have a glass casing so the operator can stop the roast when the roast gets to the desired color. Getting perfect coffee out of the AromaRoast would take a little practice. To roast the beans quicker, I needed more power or some way to trap the heat. I decided to use the box concept Ryan Jacobs described in his article [Cold Weather Roasting](https://ineedcoffee.com/cold-weather-coffee-roasting/). At this stage, I made three big mistakes. The first mistake I made was using a small box, which ended up trapping way too much heat. The second mistake I made was bending the flap back, which trapped even more heat. Finally, the biggest mistake I made was leaving the roast unattended. ### Burning Down the House Instead of monitoring the roast, which all home roasters, regardless of method, should practice doing, I was upstairs surfing the Internet looking for Melitta roasting tips. Exactly 5 minutes into the roast, I went downstairs and saw my porch filled with smoke-filled mounds. Oops! Without a moment’s pause, I sprinted to the backyard. I leaped to the outlet and yanked the cord from the wall. The box was still spitting out a column of smoke. Grabbing only the box, I shook the red-hot roaster onto the concrete. The coffee that spilled out was black as charcoal and still smoldering. The inside of the box was scorched. The coffee was destroyed. ### Coda Day one of roasting with the Melitta AromaRoast was a complete failure. The first batch was under-roasted, and the second was, to put it mildly, a tad over-roasted. The next weekend, I struck out in search of the holy grail of getting perfectly roasted coffee. Armed with a stopwatch, a notebook, a larger box, and a bucket of water, I was ready to master this roaster. However, it was too late. The inferno from the previous week had toasted the machine. It was dead. The important lesson here is **don’t leave a roast unattended**, especially when it’s a new roasting style.![unattended coffee roast](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/smoke1.CJTg57cX_UxtMI.webp)_It wasn’t this bad, but the coffee and the roaster were ruined._### Related Resources Many home roasters will tell you that you can roast better coffee cheaply and easily with a popcorn popper. Once you have mastered the basics and would like to fiddle with the electronics, search the Usenet (aka Google Groups) for Melitta posts by Ken Mary.

# Mike Griffin Knows His Beans [Coffee People](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/coffee-people/)---by [Bill Giduz](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/bill-giduz/)![Mike Griffin Knows His Beans](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/mike-griffin-knows-his-beans/griffin1.jpg) For the past four years, Davidson student Michael Griffin has pursued an insatiable curiosity about coffee with the passion of a connoisseur and the discipline of a scientist. Some of his friends claim he’s gone too far. His student apartment is equipped with “a few grand” worth of the finest grinders, stainless steel milk pitchers, and espresso machines worldwide. He wants more, too. “My mom won’t let me, but I want to sell my car to buy an espresso roaster,” Griffin admitted. “They start around $5,000… I think it’s perfectly reasonable, though. I’d save a lot on car insurance!” He also stores about 30 pounds of green, unroasted coffee beans, bagged by the pound and labeled carefully to indicate the very plantation from which they originated in a dozen or so countries around the world.![Mike Griffin](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/griffin1.B0q-aEWE_ZY2lI2.webp)_Mike Griffin_ He brews some of those beans in his apartment as espresso or cappuccino for personal consumption. But he also subjects them to experimentation in the Martin Chemical Laboratory as he seeks to discover the molecular components of the ultimate bean. “Research is imperative to the quest for better coffee,” he stated. This undergraduate chemistry major from Los Angeles is quickly becoming one of the foremost coffee experts in America. He has read scores of scientific papers about coffee and spent the last two years conducting his own experiments in the lab. He has studied “latte art,” from some of America’s foremost “baristas,” learning from them how to pour heart and rosetta shapes into the steamy foam of a cappuccino. He also worked for eight months as a barista in a Charlotte Starbucks, learning first-hand how coffee houses both educate consumers and compromise quality for commerce. Griffin refines his palate by studying a coffee “flavor wheel” poster that hangs on his wall, and by sniffing a set of 24 vials of coffee aromas he bought. The most valuable lessons come from taste-testing brews from different origins four at a time. “The key for me was brewing four at a time and comparing them,” he said. “When you do that you can begin to discern their different aspects.” He has held several “tastings” for campus friends, and many have gained a new appreciation for the common beverage. But Griffin is wary of spending too much time serving his friends. “If you convert them you have to make them coffee all the time,” he laughed. Griffin grew up in Los Angeles and began drinking cafe mochas at age 12. “I would have started earlier if I had known what I was getting into!” he joked. He became a serious aficionado of fine coffee in about 1995, then launched his career as a coffee scientist two years later when the coffee world was rocked by an amazing crop of Kenyan beans. The coffee harvested from the Kagumo plantation in 1997 carried an extraordinary amount of “brightness,” making it a very hot and expensive commodity. Experts speculated that the desirable “brightness” was a reflection of the phosphoric acid content of the beans. Griffin realized the opportunity to contribute meaningfully to the science of the subject and decided to initiate his own experiments on the Kagumo bean’s phosphate levels. He proposed the study to his academic advisor, David Blauch, associate professor of chemistry, and conducted it in Blauch’s class, and as part of an honors thesis research class. “It ended up being quite a detailed study of how phosphate levels vary with roasting levels,” said Blauch. “Michael did a really nice piece of work.” So nice, in fact, that his final paper is being published in a scientific report, _The Proceedings of the 18th Colloquium of the Association Scientifique Internationale du Cafe._ That initial investigation launched Griffin into a frenzy of scientific experimentation that has continued for almost two school years and during the past summer. He is now being funded by the Specialty Coffee Institute to conduct chromatographic experiments on coffee acids. He plans to continue at the graduate level, with the eventual goal of learning to identify the origin of any coffee based solely on its chemical components. “That’s never been done,” he said, “But it would allow you to figure out if you’re buying what you paid for.” To extend his outreach, Griffin learned HTML and established an Internet domain for an informal organization he calls The Coffee Research Institute. Its attractive Web pages educate the visitor and impress with their precision. For example, his description of espresso reads, “Espresso is a 30-50 mL extract that is prepared from 14-17 grams of coffee through which purified water of 88°-95°C has been forced at 9-10 atmospheres of pressure for a brewing time of 22-28 seconds.” But lest one think that the author approaches his subject solely as a calculating scientist, the description concludes, “Espresso brewing is defined by four “M’s”: the Macinazione is the correct grinding of a coffee blend, Miscela is the coffee blend, Macchina is the espresso machine, and Mano is the skilled hand of the barista. When each factor of the four M’s is precisely controlled, the espresso beverage that is produced is the ultimate coffee experience.” He views that perfect brew with an artist’s eye, writing that it drips out of the porta-filter “like warm honey,” with a deep reddish-brown color, and a golden-red crema. He approaches coffee with a rare combination of enthusiasm and discipline. Griffin understands there’s a proper way to do everything and applies that equally to his work in the lab and in preparing a cup to enjoy. It is just as important to him to keep his apartment coffee equipment sparkling clean as it is to maintain his lab apparatus. Measurement and technique are equally important in preparing a cup of espresso as they are in preparing coffee grounds to analyze with a gas chromatograph. As he roasts, grinds, doses, and tamps a shot of espresso, he describes in fascinating detail the proper method for each step, and why it is important to the taste of the resulting coffee. “There are at least 30 variables that affect the taste,” he concludes. “If you’re not precise about each one, you’ll never be able to isolate those factors that change the taste.” Griffin feels fortunate to live in a time of coffee renaissance and is eager to find purpose and meaning in a career in coffee science. But as much as he loves the lab, he knows he can’t complete his education there. Despite his encyclopedic knowledge, he has never visited a coffee plantation, held a coffee cherry, or smelled the fragrant jasmine aroma of coffee blossoms. Toward that end, he’s written a proposal accepted by the college for presentation to the Thomas J. Watson Foundation. If funded, it will take him next year to plantations in Brazil, Costa Rica, and Guatemala to learn about coffee from those who plant and cultivate it. The proposal also involves travel to Italy and Vienna to study the art of espresso making in lands where “coffee permeates the culture and espresso is a national pride.” Despite how much he has already accomplished and learned, Griffin recognizes that the world of coffee is almost boundless, and is passionately eager to explore it all. His proposal to the Watson Foundation concluded with the statement, “My journey is only beginning.”**UPDATE (April 4, 2000):** _Michael was one of sixty students in the United States to receive the Watson Fellowship. He will be studying the art and chemistry of espresso in Brazil, Guatemala, Costa Rica, Italy, and Vienna._ Published on January 8, 2000--- #### Bill Giduz Bill Giduz is the staff newswriter and photographer at Davidson College, and takes his morning coffee sweetened and creamed with Half-and-Half.

# Mike Rohde: Coffee Achiever [Coffee People](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/coffee-people/)---by [Alex Scofield](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/alex-scofield/)![Mike Rohde: Coffee Achiever](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/mike-rohde-coffee-achiever/sketchtoon-coffee-calendar1.jpg)_Editor Note: This coffee profile was published in December 2008. An update on Mike’s book, The Sketchnote Handbook, was added in December 2012._ When Mike Rohde was 5 years old, he spilled hot coffee on himself at his grandmother’s house. It was an unlikely introduction to the beverage for the Wisconsin-based visual designer who created the [Sketchtoon Coffee Calendar](https://ineedcoffee.com/creating-the-sketchtoon-coffee-calendar/). While the Sketchtoon Calendar may not be among the ones in the seasonal stand in your local shopping mall, it has a major online presence. Google “coffee calendar” late in 2008, and Sketchtoon is one of the two organic (standalone) hits on the first page. The “colorized” ink sketches have a steady theme, they’re informative, and they are the work of a true coffee lover. “Coffee is very important,” Rohde said in a recent e-mail interview. He and his wife start each morning with home-brewed coffee, and there’s more coffee to come at the workplace. “At Northwoods Software, where I work, I often pull shots of espresso or make cappuccinos on the office DeLonghi Magnifica, which I have to say is great to have around. … I also have a Krups espresso maker at home, which takes pods as well as ground coffee, a French press, and a handy Moka pot.”![sketchtoon coffee calendar](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/sketchtoon-coffee-calendar1.DDWy2e3E_2ngxex.webp)_[Sketchtoon Coffee Calendar](http://www.flickr.com/photos/rohdesign/2111160077/in/set-72157600161864325/) by Mike Rohde_ As for local coffee spots, Rohde is especially fond of John Harbor’s Main Street Coffee House in his hometown of Menomonee Falls, as well as Milwaukee-area roaster and cafe chain Alterra Coffee. “Now and then I like getting away to my local cafe for coffee to read, or do a little sketching or design work in a relaxed environment,” Rohde said. In general, Rohde gravitates toward premium coffee – he likes darker roasts and prefers cappuccino or a well-pulled espresso – but he’s not a snob about it. “I like exploring a wide variety of coffee and surprisingly, some diner coffees aren’t so bad. I think in the US there’s been a positive effect of Starbucks and other coffee establishments improving the quality of coffee overall,” Rohde said. “But I will say that when I encounter truly bad coffee I won’t drink it. Life is just too short to torture my taste buds.” ### Sketchnotes: Visually Noted The coffee artwork in Rohde’s calendar is an outgrowth of his Sketchnotes. They’re a twist and a major upgrade on the margin doodles of a note-taking student – Sketchnotes capture an event utilizing visual elements and fonts that are as crucial as the text in the overall presentation. Rohde created [his first Sketchnotes](http://www.flickr.com/photos/rohdesign/sets/72157600139569147/) in 2007 when he attended a UX Intensive event put on by Adaptive Path in Chicago. “I decided to try intentionally including drawings and fonts in my notes to see if it was possible and how well I would be able to capture the event,” Rohde said. “It worked out so well, I’ve continued to take [Sketchnotes] at other events.” Since then, organizers of such events as SEED 3 and An Event Apart have asked Rohde to be the official “sketchnoter.” His Sketchnotes will also cover upcoming events this month and in March 2009. “I’m very excited about these and other future sketchnoting opportunities,” Rohde said. ### Flavoring the Notes So how did the Sketchnotes get their coffee flavor? Rohde and his wife have a friend with a coffee-themed kitchen and sought a coffee calendar for her as a Christmas present. Rohde took matters into his own hands. He and his wife first created a coffee calendar with photography, but as Rohde began sketching more, he created a coffee calendar with Sketchnote-style art. In 2006, he began the sketches that would eventually form his calendar. All of Rohde’s SketchToon coffee sketches are originally [done in black-and-white](http://www.flickr.com/photos/rohdesign/2059959887) in a pocket Moleskine sketchbook. He then “colorizes” them through Photoshop, and the result is a color-themed sketch immediately recognizable as Rohde’s own. “I’ve found a few special brushes in Photoshop to create the mottled look for the dark brown, and the color for the coffee drinks was painted so it overprints the black artwork,” Rohde said. It’s a technique he’s used with some of his graphic design in the recent past, including some sketch work for the Archdiocese of Milwaukee. “I like this approach because I can easily change direction or colors by simply re-doing a layer of the Photoshop file,” Rohde said. Most of the time, Rohde sketches from experience – he’s had most of the drinks portrayed in his calendar and has sketched some of them with the real beverage before him at a local cafe. ### Conclusion: Artistry and Professionalism Last year, Rohde posted his calendar on Cafe Press, and he sold more than 100 copies. He said this demonstrated to him that there is some general interest in a coffee calendar. “It’s been very popular as a gift, I think, because there are so few good coffee calendars out there,” Rohde said. One exception he goes out of his way to praise is _The Coffee Calendar_, the work of his friend Ricardo Levins Morales. (It’s the other organic hit on the first page of a ‘coffee calendar’ Google search.) Both Rohde’s and Morales’ calendars blend an artistic edge with substantive coffee knowledge. [Mike Rohde’s website](https://rohdesign.com/) demonstrates his ability to blend artistry with professionalism, tradition with technology, and the visual image with the written word. A look at the 2009 Sketchtoon Coffee Calendar may inspire one to ask why nobody has done something like this before, but the question is moot. Mike Rohde was the one with the artistic talent, sketchnoting technique, initiative, and love of coffee to make the calendar a reality, and INeedCoffee salutes him as a Coffee Achiever._Mike Rohde hosts an [interview version](https://rohdesign.com/weblog/2008/12/2/coffee-achiever-interview-at-ineedcoffeecom.html) of this article over on his site rohdesign.com._### (December 2012) The Sketchnote Handbook Mike Rohde has taken what he has learned about sketching and written a book titled _The Sketchnote Handbook_. The description on his website says: > You can create visual notes that are a fun, engaging, valuable reference. Anyone can do it – especially regular people who feel they can’t draw. Sketchnoting is about ideas, not art. This book gives you tools to start sketchnoting right away.

# Military Orders More Caffeine For Everyone, Starting in 1832! [Coffee History](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/coffee-history/)---by [Andreanne Hamel](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/andreanne-hamel/)![Military Orders More Caffeine For Everyone, Starting in 1832!](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/military-orders-more-caffeine-for-everyone-starting-in-1832/stay-alert-gum1.jpg) Although none of the soldiers were likely to have complained, it probably didn’t take long for military generals to realize that those alcohol rations they were giving the soldiers were doing more than just boosting spirits (pun intended)… they were increasing morale to the point where the soldiers were having more fun drinking than heading out on the battlefield. And as great as it is to have your soldiers fired up for work… that’s not really the kind of firing that President Andrew Jackson wanted to see! It was in 1832 that the President signed an Executive Order that would replace each soldier’s allotment of alcohol with coffee and sugar – and to this day, caffeine has remained an essential part of a soldier’s complete breakfast. And lunch. And whatever else he’s eating! In fact, for one year during the Second World War, the entire American production amount of Nescafe’s instant coffee was purchased by the military. While there is no denying that this prior strategy of caffeine rations was the best way to ensure that the army’s soldiers stayed awake and alert on the battlefield, it always seemed like there was room for improvement. After all, in order to have a coffee, a soldier needs to boil water, get out his mug and coffee grinds or plastic one-cup dripper, pour, and wait… all of which can be a bit of a hassle for mobile troops. Fortunately for American soldiers across the nation, the military has no shortage of resources when it comes to developing new technology – and in 1998, the first packages of Stay Alert chewing gum hit the public shelves.![Stay Alert Gum](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/stay-alert-gum1.CfSyQen__Z47PRJ.webp)_Stay Alert Gum by [mr smashy](http://www.flickr.com/photos/wmode/3499255158/in/photostream/)_ Originally developed for public consumption, the concept of chewable caffeine piqued the interest of the military and since Stay Alert had a short-lived, rather unsuccessful test run in the general public, the military was able to take control of the gum’s production and develop it for their own purposes. An initial study was done in 1999, and after numerous tests on the product and its impact on the human body and reaction times, approximately 300 cases of Stay Alert gum were shipped off and rationed to soldiers on active duty. It turns out that Stay Alert gum is actually 5 times faster than coffee in delivering caffeine to the human digestive system – and the bonus for soldiers is that unlike coffee, which is a diuretic, chewing caffeinated gum won’t cause someone to need a bathroom break. After years of testing and development – and use in the field – the military’s secret tactic for wakefulness is now available to the general public. According to the studies, the gum is perfectly safe for an average user, however, the best approach is to chew one piece, wait 5 minutes and then take a second piece if it’s needed. Talk about being able to answer the call of duty!

# Minos Moka Pot Espresso Maker Review and Tutorial [Brewing Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/brewing-coffee/)---by [Michael Allen Smith](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/michael-allen-smith/)![Minos Moka Pot Espresso Maker Review and Tutorial](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/minos-moka-pot-espresso-maker-review-tutorial/Minos-Moka-Pot-Espresso-Maker640.jpg) Recently, I’ve had the opportunity to make stovetop espresso with the Minos Moka Pot Espresso Maker. The Minos is a beautiful coffee maker. It is made from heavy stainless steel with a Mirror finish, not polished aluminum, which Bialetti uses. The brewer ships with three different-colored handles (yellow, light blue, and red), so you can customize the Moka Pot to match your kitchen. For this tutorial, I will be brewing coffee using the Minos Moka Pot’s 3-cup model. There is also a 6-cup Model. The 3-cup model makes 5 ounces of stovetop espresso, whereas the 6-cup model makes double that at 10 ounces. The Minos Moka Pot has an intuitive design, but I learned a few things after brewing several cups of coffee.![Minos Moka Pot Espresso maker - 3 cup](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/minos-moka-pot-espresso-maker.w9PSw9ln_Z2lK6xP.webp) *Minos Moka Pot Espresso Maker *### #1 Add Cold Water to the Bottom Chamber Before you add water, look inside the brewer for the safety valve. Add water up to 1 cm below the safety valve. If the safety valve is submerged, the coffee will not brew properly.![add water to Moka Pot](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/moka-pot-inside.Td2lGTFG_zxFHw.webp)_Looking inside the Minos Moka Pot._![Moka Pot safety valve](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/moka-pot-safety-valve.DgXYUQqe_1kJq8z.webp)_Find the safety valve before adding water to the Moka Pot._### #2 Place Funnel in Brewer and Add Ground Coffee Minos recommends using a medium to coarse grind, as a fine grind could cause blockage. View our Coffee Grind Chart to see what a Medium Grind looks like. Fill the funnel until it is full, which works out to about 18.5 grams. ### #3 Smooth with Tamper The Minos Moka Pot ships with a metal tamper. Use this to smooth and flatten the coffee grounds. Do not pack the coffee in the funnel like you would for a traditional espresso machine. A gentle press is all that is needed.![Moka Pot - filter](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/moka-pot-tamper.Drle4XDj_Zwn1K2.webp)_Once the grounds are in the funnel, use the tamper to smooth the coffee level._  Wipe off any loose grounds that remain on the funnel’s lid. Make sure the tamper is removed before proceeding to the next step. ### #4 Attach the Coffee Pot to the Bottom Chamber Screw the coffee pot onto the bottom chamber tightly. ### #5 Make the Coffee Open the lid of the Minos while brewing and keep it open during the brew cycle. Monitoring this will let you know when the coffee has finished brewing. Once finished, you can close the lid and turn off the heat. You can use whatever heat source you like to brew the coffee. I am using an electric stove set to medium, which is the same as is recommended for the Bialetti. If you have a gas stove or campfire, Minos advises that the flame not exceed the diameter of the brewer.![Moka Pot - coffee is exiting ](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/moka-pot-brewing.D1IW52II_Z16mkCr.webp)_Around 3:30 in my brew, the coffee begins to exit the center tube of the Minos._![Moka Pot brew finished](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/moka-pot-brewing-end.jF8KUiQc_Z1afdYu.webp)_The coffee is almost finished brewing._### #6 Serve Once the coffee stops coming out of the tube in the center of the coffee pot, it has finished brewing. Close the lid, take it off the heat, and serve. The handle can be very hot (more on that below), so either pinch it or use an oven mitt to shield your thumb from the metal part of the handle.![Moka Pot handle](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/moka-pot-handle.BNMgY-mY_Z25YofK.webp)_The Minos Moka Pot with a yellow handle. Light blue and red are also shipped with the brewer._### #7 Cool Before Cleanup Unlike other coffee brewers, which can be cleaned shortly after brewing, the Moka Pot will remain hot. Give it time to cool completely before you break it down for cleaning. You can use dish detergent to clean the Minos Moka Pot. ### Classic Bialetti vs Minos: Battle of the Moka Pots Is the Minos Moka Pot better than the classic Bialetti Moka Pot? Even though both brewers make coffee in the same manner, a few differences stood out to me. #### Design I really like the Minos’s mirrored design combined with the interchangeable colored handles. This look is a modern take on a coffee brewing method that has been around since the 1930s. See our article The Story of the Bialetti Moka Express to learn more about the Moka Pot’s rich history. I also like the Bialetti’s classic design. I don’t have a strong preference for which I like better, but I give the Minos a slight edge. #### Stainless Steel vs Polished Aluminum The biggest difference between the two Moka Pots is that the Bialetti is made with polished aluminum, and the Minos Moka Pot is made with stainless steel. Which is better? To get that answer, I found a resource on the site Metal Markets that breaks it down. In the article “10 Differences Between Aluminum and Stainless Steel,” I focused on the items that would be most relevant for coffee makers. - Aluminum is prone to corrosion. Stainless steel is not. - Aluminum conducts heat better than Stainless steel. - Stainless steel can be used at higher temperatures than Aluminum. (Aluminium gets soft over 400 F) - Stainless steel is stronger than Aluminum. - Aluminum is more likely to react with foods than Stainless steel. I could not taste any metallic elements in either brew. My Bialetti, which is several years old now, is starting to look a little worn, but there is nothing to be concerned about. The Bialetti brewed faster than the Minos. Using my electric stove set on 6, the Bialetti and the Minos first saw coffee exit the tube at 3 minutes and 30 seconds. However, Bialetti finished the brew at 5:20, whereas Minos finished at 6:44. The differences may not have been due to the difference between aluminum and stainless steel. The Bialetti filter is wider and less deep than the Minos. The Bialetti also has a larger opening for the coffee to exit. Regardless of the reason, if you are an impatient coffee drinker, the edge here goes to Bialetti. And because stainless steel holds heat longer, the Minos took longer to cool down. This could be a factor if you do multiple brews back to back. A reader informed me that if one has an induction stove, that aluminum will not work. Stainless steel will. #### The Handle The Minos handle is pretty but may not be safe to grab at the end of a brew cycle. As you can see from the photo above in Step #6, the colored portion, which is safe to touch, only partially covers the handle. Depending on how hot your burner is and how long the Moka Pot remains on the stove, the metal portion of the handle can vary in temperature. You might be fine if you always grab a handle in a pinching manner. I tend to wrap two fingers inside the handle and then use my thumb on top before I close my grip. So, I need to grab a dish towel to protect my thumb before I remove the Moka Pot from the stove.![Minos Moka Pot Handle - bad touch](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/moka-pot-bad-touch.D-KqWXRM_Z1Qjksm.webp)_Depending on how long you leave the Moka Pot on the burner and how hot your burner is, this handle design can potentially burn your thumb. Use a dish towel or something to protect your hand or pinch so your fingers are only touching the silicon part of the handle._ The entire Bialetti handle is covered and safe to grab when the brew is complete.![Bialetti Moka Pot handle ](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/bialetti.BbUzDcXV_2eGcdW.webp)_Bialetti covers the entire handle._  ### Price At the time of this writing, the 3-cup Minos costs $80 USD, which is triple the price of the 3-cup Bialetti. ### Taste I could not tell much difference in the taste between the Minos and the Bialetti. Both produced a rich, strong _espresso-like_ coffee. I use the term _espresso-like_ for reasons explained in the article [Making Lattes Without an Espresso Machine](https://ineedcoffee.com/making-lattes-without-espresso-machine/). Some users of the Bialetti have reported a slightly metallic taste, which is not present in stainless steel Moka Pots such as the Minos. My Bialetti did not impart a metallic taste, but it is several years old. Had I tested with a brand new Bialetti, perhaps I would have given the taste edge to the Minos. ### The Verdict Right up until I went to pour the coffee, I liked both Moka Pots equally, but for different reasons. Then I got too close to the metal part of the Minos handle and came close to burning my hand. Even if the pinch grab method is always used to remove the Moka Pot from the burner, it is not the ideal grip for pouring. If Minos redesigned the handle so that the silicon part covered the entire handle like the Bialetti, it would have the edge. However, since I prefer not burning my hand first thing in the morning when I’m trying to wake up, I like the Bialetti more than the Minos. However, if you have an induction stove or are sensitive to any metallic tastes, the Minos is a better option.**UPDATE:** Shortly after this review was published, a reader informed me that Bialetti now makes a line of Stainless Steel Moka Pots, which would also work with induction stoves. If I can brew with one of them, this review will be updated.![Bialetti Stainless Steel Espresso Moka Pot](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/bialetti-stainless-steel-moka-pot.Ci90AeKL_Z1vViw8.webp) ### _Bialetti Stainless-Steel Stovetop Espresso Coffee Pot_### Resources [Stovetop Espresso Brewing Tutorial](https://ineedcoffee.com/stovetop-espresso-brewing-tutorial/) – INeedCoffee tutorial._Minos provided INeedCoffee with a brewer for this review/tutorial, which did not affect our review._ Published on August 14, 2017--- #### Michael Allen Smith Michael Allen Smith is both a coffee fanatic and a web developer.

# Mission: Java (Short Story) [Cafe Culture](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/cafe-culture/)---by [DeWitt Henderson](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/dewitt-henderson/)![Mission: Java (Short Story)](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/mission-java/cappuccino-coffee.jpg) In a dimly-lit cabin, in a black spaceship careering through the outer reaches of our solar system, a large alien sniffed, sniffed, and sniffed again, his snout wedged into the top of a large mug. His eyes were closed; his face carried an almost mournful expression. “Zytor! Watch the monitors, you idiot! They’ll be plenty of time for that after we make the run!” Mengwan leveled a menacing look at the crewman for a moment, then turned his large, reptilian, striped form back to the ship’s main console. He gestured at the screen with one of three meaty fingers. “There’s the strange little green planet ahead – I can just barely make it out.” Raktoff was flipping through a mag-vid. He kept returning the display to a digitized image of Juan Valdez. Looking up cautiously at Mengwan, he said “Sir, could we try the Kona blend this time? I mean, I don’t think we had that one on the last go-round, and…” Mengwan turned around even more quickly than he had in response to Zytor’s actions. “Quiet! One more uncalled-for comment and I’ll cut off your third leg! And put away that mag-vid. You’re supposed to be monitoring the ship’s vital signs, you imbecile. This is not a pleasure cruise.” Muttering further to himself, Mengwan rounded again to face the master control panel. After gazing without expression at the slowly enlarging image of Earth for a moment, he then turned his attention to a small side-screen. Quickly punching in the necessary commands, he brought up a geographical database and began to zero in on a particular area of the Earth, using smaller and smaller grids. “Here it is, you worthless excuses for a crew!” Mengwan pointed at the screen, swiveling his head around to make sure everyone was watching. “Blast the seven moons of Hrenipus! Snark, put down that comic-vid and pay attention! We’re nearing the planet. I’ve got Seattle on the grid. Raktoff! Lock in on the coordinates!” “But sir, hadn’t we discussed that before? According to the galactopedia, the principal growing regions of the required bean are to be found in what is known to the Earthlings as Central and South America, are they not? And if I remember correctly, the ‘Seattle’ you refer to is in North America.” Mengwan stared incredulously at Raktoff. “That just about borders on insolence. I give the orders here, and I say we go to Seattle, because I am party to a little bit of information that you may have missed while poring over your precious galactopedia, Raktoff, and that is: Seattle happens to be at the very pinnacle of coffee consumption in this hemisphere.” He turned around, focusing once again on the grid. “But sir, wouldn’t it be better to go to the source?”, said Raktoff, a little meekly this time. Before Mengwan could offer a rebuttal to this latest outrage, Zytor jerked his nose up and out of the mug. “No, Raktoff! Don’t you see? The captain is right – let’s go to where huge quantities exist of ready-to-prepare coffee, and better yet, ready-to-drink coffee!” He held his mug up during this last remark, as if hoping for a refill from out of nowhere. Mengwan turned his gaze to Zytor. “I appreciate the vote of support, Zytor. I also do not forget that we wouldn’t even be making this little trip if you hadn’t picked up that crate full of this insidious beverage on our last trip.” He swiveled his head this way and that, taking in the whole crew. He gave them a small smile. “Right! It’s on to Seattle, then.” “Coordinates locked in, sir. May I suggest something, sir? I saw something else in the galactopedia that…” “Yes, yes, what is it?” Mengwan glanced back impatiently. “Well, sir, it seems that there are establishments which serve the ready-to-drink beverage, as well as the unbrewed form, which are known as Starbucks. I was thinking that perhaps, given their name, they cater to a clientele consisting of beings more like us.” A large, fleshy lid lifted from a drooping position over one of Mengwan’s eyes. “Raktoff, that may be the first intelligent thing you’ve said since we left Dahrvonn.” He began to play with the database, attempting to locate a Starbucks. * * * * * * * * * Evelyn was just stuffing some bills in the cash register when she heard — and felt to some degree — the sudden ‘thump’ on the roof. She looked up at the ceiling, shook her head, and began making yet another of the cappuccinos-to-go that seemed to disappear as fast as she could make them. Frantically busy, she’d almost forgotten about the unexplained noise only a couple of minutes later when Dennis suddenly pointed excitedly at the front windows. “Look! What the hell is that? There’s a ladder being lowered from the roof!” Dennis’s eyes were wide behind his wire-rimmed glasses. Half of his customers turned their heads to see what he was getting agitated about, but the other half looked up from their newspapers with red-rimmed eyes that only reflected a deep need for caffeine. One customer, a large man in a heavy overcoat, quickly folded his Wall Street Journal and glared at Dennis. “Can you speed it up? I’m a very busy man, but I’d still like my double hazlenut vanilla decaf latte.” Dennis snapped out of his haze and met the man’s eyes. “Yes sir, I’m sorry, but I don’t understand what’s happening outside. Maybe it’s some kind of fireman’s training exercise.” He turned his attention to the large mugs in front of him. “Yaaaaaaaaaaaagggggghhhhhhhh!!!!” Evelyn screamed as she dropped a cappuccino on the floor. This time all customers – well, almost all – turned to follow Evelyn’s eyes, which were riveted on the front windows. A rather large dark green and brownish foot, with three toes ending in large, sharp nails, appeared on the first visible rung of the ladder. Another foot followed closely, then another, which were soon joined by a massive, fleshy tail that waved aimlessly around the three legs. Pandemonium erupted. Customers screamed, plowed into one another, and ran out the front door. Others scrabbled over the counter, joining Evelyn and Dennis. A few crashed directly through the windows and fled down the sidewalk.![Cappuccino](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/cappuccino-coffee.FOVJsOST_1nL4HF.webp) Evelyn grabbed the phone and dialed 911, watching a fairly slow-moving… dinosaur? …reaching the sidewalk, while other feet began to follow down the ladder. “Yes, quickly! Send police, Army, whatever, to the Starbucks on… aaaaaaagggghhh!!” She dropped the phone and held both of her hands to her cheeks, ignoring the frothy milk on both palms. The reptile was coming through the front door, which was actually a tight squeeze for it. Another was on the sidewalk by now, followed by yet another down the ladder. The large man who had been impatient with Dennis was cowering behind the counter, trying to light a cigarette, but his hands were shaking too much. Dennis glanced down momentarily, and just for an insane moment, thought about reminding the man of the store’s no-smoking policy. No one remained in the store save Evelyn, Dennis, the overcoat man, a petite woman, and a young man sporting a bright red, punkish haircut with earrings in both ears. Actually, a lone customer remained in the far corner, engrossed in the New York Times crossword puzzle. He paused often, glaring at the newspaper while slurping noisily from a steaming mug. Mengwan walked toward the counter. In his right forefoot was a small, bulging sack. Several large sacks were slung over his left shoulder. The closer he got to the counter, the more the people behind it hunkered down. Mengwan reached the counter. He looked around quizzically for a moment as Raktoff, Zytor, and Snark trooped through the door behind him. Opening the small bag, he quickly turned it upside down. Hundreds, if not thousands, of small silvery disks clattered loudly on the counter, some falling onto the floor. “One million Dahrvonnian Wambenis. We trust this is sufficient payment for your goods”, Mengwan said in English (in a low, gutteral, grating accent), to the surprise of everyone behind the counter. Evelyn jumped up and pushed through a door with an “Employees Only” sign on it. The overcoat man groaned loudly and fainted. The young man said, “Cool, like, an alien.” Mengwan smashed a fist through the glass in front of the coffee beans and began to fill a sack as Dennis watched, speechless and trembling. The petite woman suddenly leapt on top of the counter and began hitting Mengwan over the head with her briefcase. “I’ve got an important meeting in fifteen minutes, mister, and I wanted a nice big cup of cappuccino to carry in there with me.” ‘Bam!’ went the briefcase again. “How dare you terrorize innocent people like us.” Mengwan ignored her as he continued to fill his sack. “Maybe she has not consumed a sufficient quantity of the beverage today”, offered Raktoff. “No doubt”, said the young man, sipping on a latte he had picked up behind the counter. “We mean no harm, Earth people”, said Raktoff, rather perfunctorily. He, like the others, was cramming loose coffee beans and bags of coffee alike into large sacks made of a burlap type of material. He suddenly noticed Snark shoveling beans from a bin labeled “decaf” into his bag. Snark and Zytor had not spent quite as much time with the English edu-vids as the others had. “Snark! That is decaf!”, he said sharply in their guttural, native tongue. “It is no good. It… does not produce the desired effect.” Mengwan looked up from his sack-loading. “I didn’t travel three hundred and seventy-seven light-years for DECAF, you moron!” Snark looked sheepish, dumped out the sack, then moved on to another blend of coffee. Raktoff read the label, making sure it was not another decaf variety and nodded to Snark. Zytor walked to the end of the counter and began to move behind it. Dennis and the petite woman gasped and backed up into a corner. The young man moved out of the way as well, but a little more casually. Zytor stepped over the overcoat man and moved quickly to a large coffee dispenser. Bending his knees and tilting his head to one side, he opened his large mouth and began dispensing coffee directly into it. It spilled over and out of both sides of his mouth, although he was making a valiant effort to swallow all of it. He began making low, pleasured, moaning sounds. “Zytor! That is not our primary objective! Get back to work filling your sacks, er… why don’t you fill a few of those containers first, say, one for each of us?” Mengwan tugged on a leathery tie strap at the top of his sack and set it aside, only to begin filling another. The man in the corner suddenly cried out. “Damn!”, he said, as he slammed his fist on his table. He grabbed his mug and slurped some coffee. “I hate these questions! I mean, listen to this: 13 Down, 8 letters – ‘popular dessert in Portugal’”, he said, shaking his head slowly, but still not looking up. Raktoff began stuffing sugar packets, stir sticks, and a few mugs into another sack. “Ah, sir, do we want this ‘Sugar in the Raw’? I know the Earthlings routinely put sugar in their coffee, but…” He tore open a packet and squinted at its contents. “I only drink the undiluted form, Raktoff”, said Mengwan. “Yes, yes, bring it”, said Zytor, who passed around large ‘to-go’ containers of coffee – today’s special variety, an Indonesian blend. Snark opened a container of half-and-half and sniffed. “What about this?”, he said, waving the container around. Raktoff looked up. “No, leave it. It is a hybrid of by-products of a large hooved animal. It will not successfully complete the journey with us. We have learned to manufacture a powdered substitute, for those who require it with this beverage.” Raktoff moved over to another shelf, and began placing randomly selected Thermoses, coffee makers, and cups and saucers into his sack. A young policeman burst through the front door, waving a pistol around wildly. He starting to say something, but only succeeded in moving his jaw up and down like a dying fish’s shuddering gills as he took in the scene in front of him. The petite woman noticed him, and rushed to the counter. “Stop them, officer! They’re stealing all the coffee, and they’ve made me late for an important meeting.” The officer looked at her, then at Mengwan, and said “ah, well, ma’am, I…” He pulled a handkerchief out with his free hand and wiped his forehead with it. “Are you boys in some kind of costumes? I mean, it’s not exactly time for Halloween, anyway, and you should’ve known you’d still get caught. Now put those sacks down and put your hands up.” He pointed the pistol at Mengwan, but his hand wavered considerably, as he tried to keep an eye on the other three as well. “We mean no harm, Earth people”, Raktoff repeated as before. He had no other response to trouble, as they hadn’t really discussed what they’d do if they encountered any. Mengwan looked at him, seemingly unsure of what to do, but then said “Let’s go.” “Wait! I can’t let you leave the premises.” The officer continued to wave his handgun, now toward Raktoff. “Bob, having trouble here? What the…” A tough-looking, middle-aged cop with a crew-cut stepped through some of the wreckage in the floor-to-ceiling front windows. “Just what the hell is going on here?” The aliens picked up their sacks and began to move out the front door. The young cop started to say something, but Mengwan held up his coffee container and said “the blend is a very good one today”, and smiled in a way, or at least it seemed like a smile. Sharp, pointed teeth were showing. “Yeah right, buddy”, said the older cop. “Just hold it right there in your little Godzilla suit, or you and your cup are gonna spring a few leaks.” The aliens did not stop moving. Snark and Zytor grunted as they trudged up the ladder with the weight of several sacks. The two cops stepped out onto the sidewalk with them, continuing to point their guns at the aliens. “I told you to stop! This is your last warning!”, said the older cop. He suddenly noticed the hulking black spaceship on the roof. Rows of small red lights blinked consistently, almost as if they were parking lights. Raktoff followed the others up the ladder. Mengwan faced the officers as he waited his turn. “We paid, your excellencies. I assure you. Full payment is to be found in the establishment.” Bam! A shot was fired from the older cop’s gun. The bullet ricocheted off Mengwan’s thick, leathery hide, near the left shoulder. He raised a fleshy eyelid in question, but said nothing, turned, and began to climb the ladder. The young cop looked incredulously at Ralph, the older cop. “You tryin’ to get us killed?” “Look, kid, we’ve got to stop these freaks.” He fired another shot, this time missing Mengwan’s tail as it disappeared over the rooftop. The two cops backed up toward the street, trying to get a better look at what was happening on the rooftop. Dennis, the petite woman, and the young man came out of the storefront, looking around cautiously. In seconds, a whirring sound, resembling an enormous vacuum cleaner, increased steadily in volume until it drowned out all other sounds in the immediate vicinity. Ralph squeezed off a couple more shots, which bounced harmlessly off of the battered black hull. The spaceship began to lift slowly from the rooftop. Once aloft, it quickly increased in speed, accelerating past the city skyline, becoming smaller and smaller, resembling a black speck, then finally disappearing from view. The odd little crowd watched, speechless. “Hey–they left their ladder”, offered the young man, still sipping on his latte. “I just don’t get it”, said Dennis. “I mean, coffee? They came for coffee?” “Nobody’ll believe me. I know they won’t”, said Bob, looking blankly at Ralph. “I still need my cappuccino before I go to work!” The petite woman glared at Dennis, as if he’d been intentionally slow in filling her order. Everyone slowly walked back into the store, including the police. The overcoat man snored peacefully behind the counter. Evelyn was nowhere to be seen. The man with the crossword puzzle stood up and stretched. He walked toward to the counter, stepping over glass shards and overturned chairs, reaching it just as Dennis slipped behind it. “Could I get a refill?”, he asked. * * * * * * * * * Aboard the ship, now cruising through the upper layers of the Earth’s stratosphere, lay an odor of coffee so thick and so strong, that sleep was likely to be a problem for the crew later, as simply breathing would probably cause them to absorb too much caffeine. Mengwan sat in front of the ship’s console once again, monitoring several screens simultaneously. Raktoff busily set the coordinates for a direct voyage to Dahrvonn. Zytor and Snark flipped through mag-vids as they stirred coffee in new travel-sized mugs with their free forefeet. “Well, here’s to a successful voyage, crew, even though the local hospitality seems to leave a little to be desired.” Mengwan beamed as he waved his coffee container around, carelessly spilling a few precious drops before indulging in another gulp.

# Mocha Chip Cookie [Recipes](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/coffee-recipes/)---by [Stefanie Spencer](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/stefanie-spencer/) The only thing better than coffee is chocolate, or is it the other way around? Either way, they are both fabulous and go great together. You could have a cup of hot coffee while enjoying a chocolate cake or mousse, but how about putting the two together? Hershey’s now makes a dark chocolate espresso bar to give you that extra boost of energy from caffeine and sugar. Coffee can add that touch of distinction to your favorite chocolate confection. One of my favorites is a super easy and fast Mocha Chip Cookie recipe. Preheat Oven to 350 F - 1 box Chocolate Cake Mix - 2 Eggs - 1/2 cup butter - 2 oz. Espresso (or substitute) - 1 cup Chocolate Covered Coffee Beans and/or Chocolate Chips If you do not have the espresso, that’s fine. Use two slightly heaping teaspoonfuls of instant coffee and add enough warm water to make 2 oz. Put this in the refrigerator to cool to at least room temperature. Mix all items on low just until mixed, and then add the chocolate chips or chocolate-covered coffee beans or some of both if you would like. Drop onto cookie sheets and bake at 350 F for about 12 minutes. If the cookies fall when you take them out, cook the next batch a couple of minutes longer. This easy recipe also has some great variations. Leave out the espresso and add 1/2 cup of all-natural chunky peanut butter for a chocolate peanut butter cookie, or add some cinnamon to make a chocolate spice cookie. This is one of my favorite cookie recipes, and I hope you enjoy it, too!

# Moka Pot Coffee Dispenser Review [Espresso](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/espresso/)---by [Michael Allen Smith](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/michael-allen-smith/)![Moka Pot Coffee Dispenser Review](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/moka-pot-coffee-dispenser-review/Moka-Pot-Coffee-Dispenser.jpg) To be honest, I don’t often brew coffee with my Moka Pot. It seems like too much of a hassle. Getting the perfect amount of coffee in the filter without packing it too tightly or without making a mess on the counter with loose grounds gets old really fast, especially when you are half-awake at 6 a.m. So, I rarely brew with or even think about my Bialetti Moka Pot. Then I received an email from an authorized distributor for the company Meliconi about a gadget they made to streamline the moka pot’s dosing process. I was unaware that anyone was working on ways to improve the process of making stovetop espresso, so I had them send me their Dosacaffe Espresso Dispenser to try out for myself. ### The Dosacaffe Espresso Dispenser The Dosacaffe Espresso Dispenser is a simple device. Take off the top of the dispenser and fill it with ground coffee. Remove the bottom lid. Place the bottom portion of your Moka Pot underneath the dispenser and dock it into place. Turn the knob clockwise until it stops moving and then let it return. Repeat the turn. Your Moka Pot is now dosed. The lid may not want to come off initially.

The ideal customer would be someone who makes Moka Pot on a regular basis. Having another coffee gadget might be a problem for some, but the dispenser also serves as a place to store ground coffee. If you only make Moka Pot occasionally, purchasing the dispenser is unnecessary. Wiping the counter would be less work than cleaning and drying the dispenser. But for daily Moka Pot brewers, the Dosacaffe Espresso Dispenser is worth considering. The Dosacaffe Espresso Dispenser holds 250 grams of ground coffee. ### Resources [How to Brew Espresso in a Moka Pot](https://ineedcoffee.com/brewing-espresso-in-a-moka/) – INeedCoffee tutorial that uses sugar.

# Monsooned Coffee [Coffee History](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/coffee-history/)---by [Stefanie Spencer](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/stefanie-spencer/)![Monsooned Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/monsooned-coffee/monsoon-coffee-india1.jpg) In the 1600s coffee made its way to Europe, first through the port of Venice, Italy. By sea, it traveled, and traveled, and traveled some more. In the days before FedEx (can that even be imagined), people were eagerly waiting for any new shipment and were patient with the not-so-great shape of some of the items. Monsooned coffee was born out of this unlikely situation. The coffee beans, in large wooden sailing ships, made their way across the sea, which could take up to 6 months to arrive in Europe from the Indian and other tropical coffee growing regions. In the bottom of a wooden vessel, conditions were dark, damp, and musty. It could become wet and even moldy before it reached its European port. Since coffee only grows in tropical regions, these people did not have a clue what fresh, clean coffee tastes like. They welcomed the coffee as it was, not knowing any different. In the ship, the beans would soak up moisture, swell in size, change color to a pale yellow (fresh, unroasted coffee beans would be green), and, with a great effect on taste, lose much of their acidity. This coffee with a unique earthy, slightly musty taste (okay, just call it mold), coupled with low acidity, quickly became a preferred drink.![Monsoon Coffee India](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/monsoon-coffee-india1.Dmz3R6wX_Z93xvj.webp)_[India Monsoon Coffee](http://www.flickr.com/photos/kpradeep/4127610385/in/photostream/) by Pradeep Kumbhashi_ As the shipping methods and vessels improved, the taste of the coffee changed. No longer were the coffee beans subject to these “sub-standard” conditions. The coffee arrived fresh, now tasting brighter, spicier, more acidic, and less earthy. They said, “What happened to our coffee?!” All the great new shipping methods that kept the items nice turned out to be a problem instead of an improvement. The people were upset, wanting again the coffee they had grown to love. The original taste of this coffee was lost, but not forever. In India now there is a common process, called monsooning, that recreates this taste. After the coffee beans are washed, instead of the normal drying process, they are spread out on a warehouse floor during the monsoon season. They are not directly rained on but instead soak up moisture from the humid air blowing through. This process can take up to 16 weeks to complete, recreating the humid, long journey that once brought this beloved bean to Europe. If you would like to take a journey back to the 1600s, brew a cup of Monsooned Malabar and let your imagination run away. Some supermarkets carry it, but it is easily purchased on the internet. Rev. Edward Terry, the chaplain to Sir Thomas Roe, who was ambassador at the court of Emperor Jehangir, provides a detailed account of its usage (in 1616): > _Many of the people there (in India), who are strict in their religion, drink no Wine at all; but they use a Liquor more wholesome than pleasant, they call Coffee; made by a black Seed boiled in water, which turns it almost into the same colour, but doth very little alter the taste of the water: notwithstanding it is very good to help digestion, to quicken the spirits, and to cleanse the blood._ Published on February 1, 2007--- #### Stefanie Spencer Stefanie writes for the Voice in the Desert newspaper, a local paper serving Cochise County, Arizona.

# My Name Is Java [Cafe Culture](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/cafe-culture/)---by [Rena Rogers](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/rena-rogers/)![My Name Is Java](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/my-name-is-java/espresso1.jpg) I silently wait every morning, afternoon, and evening. It is so cold and dark in the mornings. Will she rise early today, or will she be late? I ask the same question every day. You see my name is Java. I know this because I see the reflection of the writing on the front of me. I share all of her time, and I know she loves me. We awake together, read the paper, watch the news, and at times, I lay next to her in the evenings. She is unable to function without me. My friend Mr. Coffee howls each morning, to let her know it is time to rise. She rushes in and grabs me; I feel the warmth, the sweet smell, and the taste of cream and sugar. And when it is a good day, my cup runneth over. I know that her love for me is real, that she will always defend me. I can still hear her say: “No, that’s my Java.” I am irreplaceable. And I will never let her down. There are moments when she is not able to spend a lot of time with me. Nevertheless, I will wait, until we meet again.![espresso](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/espresso1.2Ux6ppGQ_Z7yGJv.webp) Just recently Mr. Coffee spewed some words to me, “You know, you’re not the important one here! It’s the java.” “What do you mean ‘the java’? My name is “Java.” Again hissing at me, “You dummy, the java is what she puts in you”. But not even his words could dampen my spirit. I know that I am the important one! Without me, she could not enjoy this so-called java. For I am the java cup. So another day begins with me!

# My Coffee Tis of Thee: America’s Patriotic Coffee History [Coffee History](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/coffee-history/)---by [CB Miller](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/cb-miller/)![My Coffee Tis of Thee: America’s Patriotic Coffee History](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/my-coffee-tis-of-thee/coffee-history-gabby-orcutt.jpg) It is not stretching the truth to say that coffee played an important role in the founding of this country. From its introduction to European culture, coffee had been considered synonymous with intellectual discourse. Because of the connection between coffee and politics, it is perhaps the most important drink for American history. ### On American Soil The great thinkers of the 18th Century would gather at colonial coffee houses/taverns, such as the **Green Dragon** in Boston, to discuss the important issues of the time. In 1765, a crowd gathered to burn an effigy of Andrew Oliver a Liberty Tree. Oliver was doing the unpopular work of King George III by selling stamps, a form of taxation. The group eventually dispersed, but they gathered the next day at the Green Dragon to discuss the political events of the previous day. In so doing, they formed a group that they dubbed the Sons of Liberty. The Green Dragon Inn Tavern and Coffee House was their regular meeting place. (2)![Green Dragon tavern - Boston](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/650px-Green_Dragon_Tavern1.CeuUGBrH_owiGt.webp)_Green Dragon Tavern in Boston – credit BPL (Wikipedia)_  ### Coffee as Patriotism When the British sought to punish the colonies by unfair taxation on tea, coffee became not only the preferred drink but the patriotic one as well. The East India Company couldn’t conceive of the colonists doing without tea, so they sent over a full cargo of tea in a marketing scheme that would pay the taxes to the King, but cut out the middlemen merchants. This scheme infuriated the colonists. A particularly energized group in Boston carried out the event which became known as the Boston Tea Party. They threw the tea overboard and vowed against drinking tea, in favor of coffee. With the advent of the Revolutionary War, coffee houses soon became the preferred meeting place of the newly formed Continental Congress. The most famous coffee house of the time was the **Merchant’s Coffee House** in Philadelphia, also known as the **City Tavern**. It was there that the Declaration of Independence was first read aloud to the public. One could argue that America began to define itself by its connection with coffee as opposed to tea. So stand up for something you believe in, drink coffee, and make our forefathers proud.![declaration-of-independence john trumbull](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/declaration-of-independence-john-trumbull.30Pe9eyq_1y1WlV.webp)_Founding Fathers at the signing of the Declaration of Independence.

# Moka Pot Stove [Brewing Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/brewing-coffee/)---by [David Laaneorg](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/david-laaneorg/)![Moka Pot Stove](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/moka-pot-stove/moka-pot-stove-setup.jpg) Being a person who appreciates a good cup of coffee, I have always been interested in doing everything possible to ensure that my cup is a good one. I have also been a person of sub-average means, so although a full-on espresso maker is something I would love to have, I can’t bring myself to buy one of those really cheap machines that will never really do a good job. As well, I love to spend time camping and canoeing, so having something low-tech fits the bill quite well. It was here at INEEDCOFFEE that I learned how to use a [Moka pot](https://ineedcoffee.com/brewing-espresso-in-a-moka/), which is something I have really enjoyed. It also is something that would be easy to bring along when I’m out in the woods to help me make a good cup of coffee. But making coffee at home without a gas stove makes things a little more interesting. As you notice, the Moka pot is much smaller than the smallest electric stove element. Most of the heat is wasted, and the handle does get quite warm. Yes, I realize that turning the pot will place the handle off to the other side, but still, there is a lot of wasted energy.![moka pot](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/md6478721.BKr256UK_ZRprnN.webp)_Moka Pot_ I needed another option. I also needed something for camping because most camping stoves are larger and put out a lot of heat. Searching the internet (something I have been mocked quite a bit for), I have found a solution that meets my needs for making coffee, a solution that can also be used while camping, and my third need for tinkering and making things myself. I found a solution at _Zen Backpacking Stoves_, which describes several options for making alcohol stoves yourself out of recyclable and readily available materials. Plus, it’s not hard to make one. Here’s a picture of my current setup.![moka pot stove setup](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/moka-pot-stove-setup._v_ffDar_1oe6Yl.webp)_Moka Pot Stove Setup_ The small stove has been modified slightly to make it specific for brewing. A stove made for boiling water will heat up the Moka pot too quickly, and the brew just won’t be what it should be. I tinkered with it a bit and found that four breather holes in the sides of the stove worked best to produce the 3-minute brew time recommended for a Moka pot. I also tinkered with the size of the main burner hole a little, starting with a hole sized with a penny, then nickel, then quarter. I found a nickel-sized hole to be the best. The stove will prepare a 4-cup-sized Moka pot using about three teaspoons of fuel. Not bad at all. I use methyl-hydrate for the fuel, and I leave the exhaust hood fan running to help get rid of any fumes, even though alcohol stoves don’t produce much fumes, but it’s better to be safe when using it inside.![moka pot on burner](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/m50f13e34.Cc-xSdoI_1hCwWf.webp)_Moka Pot on the burner_![stove burner](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/m3f3d0477.u9KuJO7t_Z1y6AAn.webp)_Stove Burner_![Brewing Moka Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/m589126c7.BR8huCAN_Z2h5Lpe.webp)_Brewing Moka Coffee_ I made a stand out of an empty coffee can and some coat-hanger wire. Light the stove, place the stand over the top, and put the Moka pot on top. In the magical three minutes, I have a fresh pot of Moka pot espresso to enjoy! With practice, I have found just the right amount of fuel so that it extinguishes itself shortly after the coffee is ready. Let the stove cool, and just put it away. Always keep fuel away from children and follow reasonable practices. ### Resources [Zen Backpacking Stoves](https://zenstoves.net/) – Provider of alcohol stoves.

Alex Scofield did such a good job on [Alex’s Worst Cup of Coffee Ever](https://ineedcoffee.com/alexs-worst-cup-of-coffee-ever/) that I never told my tale. I think it is time I shared my worst cup of coffee ever story. I was 17 years old, and I had never tasted coffee. I had no interest in the beverage. I was interested in finding a way to pay for college, so I joined the Army National Guard. My basic training was at Fort Benning, Georgia. On a military base (or at least ours), all the soldiers needed to have their shirt sleeves up or down. We were coming out of summer and heading into the cool autumn, so our sleeves were still up. Each morning got colder and colder.![Future Coffee Fanatic](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/mas-army-basic-training1.B-tZbLyw_1muK5.webp)_Future Coffee Fanatic?_ On one bitterly cold morning, all the troops were told to wait outside the barracks. I don’t recall exactly what the vessel carrying the coffee was, but it was a multi-gallon. I had no interest in coffee, but I watched as a few soldiers grabbed a Styrofoam cup and poured a cup of coffee. They sipped the coffee, and it appeared they were warming up. I was still a few months away from my 18th birthday, and that was the first moment of my life when I considered drinking coffee.![army basic training](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/taking-notes-basic-training.CI_yJMbZ_2jLU99.webp)_Photo of a future coffee drinker (left)._ I didn’t want coffee, but that morning, I was painfully cold and needed to take action. There was no milk or sugar available. My indoctrination would be black coffee. I poured myself a cup and held the cup with both hands. My hands were warming up. I put my head over the rising steam of the coffee. My face was warming up. But I was still cold, so I took my first sip. My taste buds revolted. It was the most horrific taste of my life. Bitter. Dirt. Poison._Is this what coffee tasted like?__Is society mad?__Do people drink this crap?_ I stepped away from everyone and spit out the coffee. Then I did a few more spits just to remove every drop of the vile substance from my mouth. The coffee in the cup was poured into the ground. At that moment I vowed never to drink coffee again. Well, we all know how that vow turned out. 🙂 Published on April 8, 2010--- #### Michael Allen Smith Michael Allen Smith is both a coffee fanatic and a web developer.

# My Cat Kato vs. The Kona Coffee Plant [Cafe Culture](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/cafe-culture/)---by [Michael Allen Smith](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/michael-allen-smith/)![My Cat Kato vs. The Kona Coffee Plant](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/my-cat-kato-vs-the-kona-coffee-plant/kato-stairs.jpg)_This article was written in November 1999. The original photos were located and added to the article in November 2011._ Next week many boxing fans will tune in to see Evander Holyfield fight Lennox Lewis. Not me. I’ll be watching a continuing battle in my own home. The two warriors are my 6-month-old kitten and my Hawaiian Kona plant. The plant is doing its best to stay alive outside of Hawaiian soil, and the kitten is doing her best to rip every leaf off. As much as we try to keep our kitten, Kato, away from the Hawaiian Kona plant, she still manages to sneak over and rough it up now and then. Will the plant survive Kato’s wrath? Will Kato show mercy? Or will the plant survive regardless of whatever Kato dishes out? Which contender has more stamina and strength? ### In this corner: Kona Coffee Plant By most accounts, the Kona plant should have been dead a long time ago. How does a delicate Kona coffee plant survive in Alexandria, Virginia? The DC Metro area is hardly an ideal region for a coffee plant. Not only has the plant survived, but it has also grown to a height of almost five feet tall. Granted, it won’t produce coffee, but it is a cool plant regardless.![kona coffee plant](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/kona-coffee-plant1.CTfujaCa_1voTI0.webp)_Kona Coffee plant_### In this corner: Kato the Kitten Kato is a feisty kitten full of energy with a devastating right jab. Her reach is extensive, and her vertical leap is impressive. She can easily grab the leaves of the Kona plant’s lower half and has on more than one occasion.![Kato nears Kona](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/kato-nears-kona.BOB5sh9i_ZrPA5I.webp)_Kato nears Kona_### Tale of the Tape - **Speed:** Kato can “hit and run.” The plant can’t move. Edge Kato. - **Reach:** Kato has an impressive reach, but at 5 feet tall, the Kona plant towers over the kitten. Edge Kona. - **Endurance:** The plant has tolerated both the weather and the kitten. Kato gets bored quickly. Edge Kona. - **Attack Skills:** Kato has an excellent strike capable of tearing a leaf in a single swipe. Kona is unwilling to fight the cat. Edge Kato. - **Summary:** Both opponents have their strengths and weaknesses. Too close to call.![Kato surrounds Kona](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/kato-surrounds-kona.BCclJAF7_Z1lEgwo.webp)_Kato Surrounds Kona_![Kato vs Kona](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/kato-vs-kona.DCSA8H0Y_Zbkq5o.webp)_Kato vs Kona_### Who will win? In our household, we hope Kato will throw in the towel and announce her retirement. We do our best to keep Kato from Kona but aren’t always successful. Maybe we can get Don King to convince Kato to move on to a new challenge, like attacking the cat in the mirror. Meanwhile, the Kona continues its **rope-a-dope*** strategy. Is the Kona conserving energy, or will Kato deliver the knockout punch? Ding!_**Rope-A-Dope**: In 1974, Muhammed Ali fought heavily favored George Foreman in Zaire in a fight known as “The Rumble in the Jungle.” Foreman was considered the hardest puncher in heavyweight history, but Ali won. Ali backed up against the ropes and let Foreman punch him until he tired himself. Later, Ali came off the ropes to win the fight. Muhammed Ali called this his “rope-a-dope” technique._**UPDATE June 2000:** The Kato vs. Kona battle winner turned out to be the Kona plant. The Kona plant hung in through several beatings until, eventually, Kato got bored and started picking on the leather couch. Prior to moving from Alexandria to San Diego, the plant was donated to our neighborhood coffee shop. Today, that plant sits proudly in the front window of the Starbucks at 1464 N. Beauregard Street in Alexandria, VA. Kato also moved to San Diego. There are no plans for a rematch.

# Nanopresso Portable Espresso Maker Tutorial [Brewing Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/brewing-coffee/)---by [Michael Allen Smith](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/michael-allen-smith/)![Nanopresso Portable Espresso Maker Tutorial](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/nanopresso-portable-espresso-maker-tutorial/Nanopresso-Portable-Espresso-Maker.jpg) Recently, I received a cool little coffee gadget called the Nanopresso. Without power, this little coffee maker uses a built-in pump to generate enough pressure to make espresso shots. If you are looking for something that makes espresso but are on a budget or don’t have the counter space for a dedicated machine, read on. The Nanopresso comes in several colors. Since I could see taking this device on a camping trip or backpacking, I opted for a bright orange color. This way, I would have less of a risk of losing it in the darkness, and I just like the color orange. Some other colors include yellow, red, black, and various colors of “tattoo”.![nanopresso ](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/nanopresso-box.DC6qBfGZ_MoMVF.webp)_Nanovessel and Nanopresso_ Wacaco also makes an attachment called the Nanovessel to store extra hot water for the Nanopresso. It attaches directly to the Nanopresso, so there is no heat loss when pouring hot water. Let’s make some espresso. ### Before You Brew Nanopresso recommends running a brewing cycle using just hot water and no coffee to minimize heat loss. Pre-heating your cup with hot water is also a good idea. If you do not preheat everything, you might find the espresso is too cool for your liking and slightly weak due to under-extraction. ### Add Ground Coffee to Basket Add 8 grams of finely ground coffee to the basket. The Nanopresso ships with a scoop that holds exactly 8 grams, so you don’t need to weigh anything. After filling the scoop, place the filter basket over it. Then flip. The ground coffee will fall directly inside. Then tamp firmly using the bottom of the scoop. Brush away any loose grounds.![nanopresso add espresso](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/nanopress-add-espresso.52O87pEf_ZsDhLa.webp) ### Prep the Coffee For Brewing Cover the filter basket with the portafilter and then place it on top of the main body of the Nanopresso. Then screw the nozzle firmly to the main body. The nozzle is the name for the entire top part (plastic + portafilter).![nanopresso cover](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/nanopresso-cover.CWosneZo_R3F68.webp)![nanopresso attach](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/nanopresso-attach.D2kUaFDi_2mMGO9.webp)![nanopresso top cover](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/nanopresso-top-cover.C-dJOjTE_Z1HPYvl.webp) ### Prep the Water For Brewing Add boiling water to the water tank. The Nanopresso holds between 50 to 80 ml of water. The lower range would be ideal for darker roasts and ristretto shots. Use the upper range for lighter single-origin coffees. Screw the main body tightly to the water tank, which fits right below.![nanopresso water](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/nanopresso-water.KFRXWESI_Fu5GS.webp) ### Pull Your Espresso Shot The first step to pulling a shot is to unlock the piston. This means turning the knob until the espresso pump pops out from the body. At this point, flip the brewer upside-down over a cup. Press once per second. After eight pumps, the espresso will begin flowing. Continue pumping until all the coffee exits the brewer.![nanopresso pump](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/nanopresso-pump.BFiz2XDN_1v5iqu.webp)![nanopresso espresso shot](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/nanopresso-espresso-shot.IOcdCdCn_2lNhA5.webp) ### Clean Up Nanopresso outlines three levels of cleaning in the instruction manual. For normal use, cleaning just involves disassembling the brewer and rinsing with hot water. Every 20th brew, they advise using the brush included with the brewer for a deeper clean. Then every 6 months, pull out your screwdriver to remove the filter mesh to allow cleaning underneath it. ### Overview Nanopresso uses the person making the coffee’s pressing action to generate enough atmospheres of pressure to make espresso. No electricity is required. It’s pretty cool. ### Resources [Wacaco – Portable Espresso Machines](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-y91EU3KtDG_yZuSxeMI6w?view_as=subscriber) – YouTube channel with recipes and more.

# New Marketing Opportunities for the Tea Industry [Coffee Business](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/coffee-business/)---by [Andrew Hetzel](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/andrew-hetzel/)![New Marketing Opportunities for the Tea Industry](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/new-marketing-opportunities-for-the-tea-industry/teacupflower4501.jpg)_The full title for this article is **Explosion of Specialty Coffee Shops Creates New Marketing Opportunities for the Tea Industry**_ As I travel around the world consulting with coffee retailers, several trends keep coming up: more teas and more exotic choices are on the menu, specialty sources are becoming the norm instead of the exception, and most importantly, the pseudo-adversarial position is now the start of a beautiful friendship of cooperation between the tea and coffee vendors. Tea has infused the consciousness of the savvy coffee retailer who understands that catering to tea-drinking companions of coffee drinkers can literally double the profits. For both markets, riffs on classics and hot and cold tea “drinks” make everyone happy. Ten years ago, a green tea frappe was unheard of, now it’s a staple for many shops with many delicious interpretations.![tea cup with flower](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/teacupflower4501.C6aurGSd_HMCCU.webp)_Tea Cup_ Each year, the American palate grows more sophisticated as more people explore countries and cultures through conventional travel and electronic journeys through their televisions. Once they taste and learn about different beverages, they seek them close to home. The choices for teas follow in the happy steps of European-style, espresso-based beverages that have become ubiquitous on the coffee house menu. A regular cup ‘o Joe may not be extinct but it embraces the sophisticated specialty coffee niche of the “single-estate” or–at least–country of origin when customers order 100% Kona or Kenyan AA by name instead of black, one sugar… By duplicating this niche marketing with tea, coffee retailers can go beyond English Breakfast or Earl Grey to serve organic Darjeeling from the Makaibari Estate that’s like apricot nectar or an exclusively organic lushly aromatic Kanro Gyokouro Japanese green that can make tea lovers weep with joy. Even less-adventurous tea drinkers like an iced tea flavored with passionfruit or an Earl Grey with true bergamot essence rather than the harshness of synthetic flavoring. Retailers can savor strong selling points with tea as they have with coffee. Often, tea provides even greater profits: 30-40 cups per pound of coffee and 180-200 cups per pound of tea means “black” on the bottom line and then some. Specialty coffee and tea sellers also cash in on the current love affair with organic and Fair Trade (R) choices, whether they’re single estates or beans and leaves from cooperatives. Spectacular value is added beyond the flavor in the cup and the concepts are easy to sell: hand farming, fair trade labor, pricing practices, and the exclusivity of limited supply. The elegant tea salon is diminishing as tea retailers pursue the casual consciousness of twenty-somethings who like the wireless, hip environment to enjoy who the taste, the meditative qualities, and the variety of tea. Reaching out to the coffee retailer as a burgeoning market for tea is a fantastic opportunity for the tea vendor and an equal opportunity for the coffee sellers to rethink the menu and enhance it with profitable showplace teas, hot and cold mixed tea drinks, and the specialty niche of organic or single-estate teas. Cross-marketing possibilities between coffee and tea shops are endless and it wouldn’t surprise me if mergers of the two make a multi-beverage shop the retailing center of the future.

# Next Generation Instant Coffee Reviews [Brewing Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/brewing-coffee/)---by [Michael Allen Smith](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/michael-allen-smith/)![Next Generation Instant Coffee Reviews](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/next-generation-instant-coffee-reviews/next-generation-instant-coffee-2.jpg) In the early 2000s, I recall reading an article online that made a strong case for why instant coffee didn’t have to suck. I’ve forgotten where I read it, but the core message stuck with me. If one used a really good coffee, it could, in theory, preserve much of the flavor we experience when we brew it normally. Instant coffee has a long, interesting history, going back as far as 1771. It is a history of innovation. In the 1960s, the freeze-drying method was implemented, and it is still used today. It would be sad if the story of instant coffee ended there. Thankfully, with rampant innovation in the coffee space, it was just a matter of time before someone made a better instant coffee. In 2009, Starbucks released the VIA “Ready Brew,” an instant version of a few of their coffees. You may or may not like the darker Starbucks roast, but they did an impressive job of capturing the flavor of their coffee with the VIA. Starbucks demonstrated that you could copy the taste of a darker roast. Could it also be done with a lighter-roasted, higher-quality coffee? Perhaps even single-origin coffee? Third-wave instant coffee? ### Meet Sudden Coffee and Joe Coffee This month, I’ve had the opportunity to taste the future of instant coffee, and I’m impressed. The article I read many years ago that made the case that instant coffee could be great has come true. Both Sudden Coffee and Joe Coffee sent me samples of their instant coffees, and both exceeded my expectations for how good an instant coffee could taste. Let’s dive into both products. #### Sudden Coffee Sudden Coffee ships its instant coffee in these cute beaker-like capsules. They partner with world-class coffee roasters such as 49th Parallel, Equator, and Intelligensia to source and roast the coffees for their instant offerings. I tried the Peru Rayos Del Sol, a light sweet roast roasted by Intelligentsia Coffee, and the Colombia Cristalina, a juicy medium roast by Equator Coffee. Both were very tasty. They captured the flavors that I experience when I make pour-over coffee. Inside each capsule is 5.7 grams of instant coffee. The cap is recyclable, and the beaker part is compostable.![sudden instant coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/sudden-instant-coffee.BrgVAYss_Z1Ey8nK.webp)_Sudden Coffee – Getting ready to make a mug of coffee._#### Joe Coffee Joe Coffee uses a traditional paper packet with 4.8 grams of instant coffee. I tried both The Daily House Blend and the La Familia Guarnizo from Colombia. Both were excellent, but I preferred the single-origin Colombian with deep chocolate notes.![joe coffee instant](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/joe-coffee-instant.To4kKTqX_JWAhC.webp)_Joe Coffee – 2 packets of instant coffee_### Instant Iced Coffee I hadn’t thought about using instant coffee for making iced coffee, but the package that shipped with Joe reminded me that the coffee brews just as well in cold water. So, I tried making iced coffee with both the Sudden and the Joe, and it worked just as well as its hot version. It’s awesome to be able to carry a few packets of quality instant coffee in your backpack or car, knowing you don’t even need hot water. Just get a cup of ice water, pour in the packet, stir it, and have a tasty iced coffee ready. ### A Winner? For this review, I asked some friends to vote for their favorite. It was a split decision. We liked both the Sudden Coffee and the Joe Coffee about the same, with half of us giving the edge to Sudden and the other half to Joe. High-end instant coffee is not cheap. The price per cup ranges from $2.50 to $3.30, depending on the brand and quantity purchased. You could get Starbucks VIA or Trader Joe’s Instant Coffee at a much lower price, but they don’t taste nearly as good. As a coffee fan, if you can try these next-generation instant coffees, do so. I think you’ll be impressed. The body of instant coffee is not as rich as brewed coffee, nor would I expect it to be. The good news is that the flavor profiles are far better than ever. ### Resources [The History of Instant Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/the-history-of-instant-coffee/) – INeedCoffee article covering the origins of instant coffee.

# Naturally Flavored Coffee [Recipes](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/coffee-recipes/)---by [Chris Arnold](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/chris-arnold/)![Naturally Flavored Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/naturally-flavored-coffee/zest450.jpg) Flavored Coffee. You either love it or hate it. Purists say that traditionally flavored coffees are nothing more than a foo-foo way of covering up and obfuscating the natural flavors of coffee varietals. Others find comfort in Pumpkin Spice drip coffee in November or a Blueberry-Mango iced coffee in July. Whichever camp you are in, read on. Most of the traditionally flavored coffee beans have flavoring oils sprayed and mixed with the beans after roasting. These coffee flavor oils are many times a combination of natural and synthetic flavor chemicals, which are concocted by professional flavor chemists. Sometimes, certain flavors require nearly 100 different compounds to achieve the desired taste!![Natural Spices](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/spice4501.Cgu5cmGI_1AEBcx.webp)_Natural Spices are a great option for flavoring coffee._ If you want these chemicals in your flavored coffee, then just buy any flavored coffee, and you should be good. However, if you are a coffee purist or would like a healthier, natural alternative, read on. You are going to be shown some very interesting 100% natural flavors that can be added to your favorite cup without all those nasty chemicals on the outside of the coffee bean. There are basically 2 ways to flavor your coffee. You can add certain ingredients to the ground coffee, so the flavors are extracted with the hot water along with the coffee. Typically it works well in a drip machine by adding to the brew basket. Some of the ingredients can also be added to a French Press or [Press Pot](https://ineedcoffee.com/press-pot-tutorial/). The other way is more familiar to some. This involves adding flavors (such as cinnamon or nutmeg) to the cup after brewing. The ingredients can be sprinkled on top for an intense but brief burst of flavor or stirred in to give a more subtle but long-lasting enhanced coffee-drinking experience. Here is a list of a few suggested recipes taken from the list of ingredients at the bottom. Remember, this is a partial list. Think of anything that might sound good in coffee, and try it – you may be surprised. Generally, no quantities are listed since that is up to you. Also, the types of coffee used are up to you. Some nice choices would be something like a Brazil Daterra, Costa Rica Tarrazu, Sumatra Mandheling, or a Galapagos Island Coffee for the spiced recipes, and perhaps an Ethiopian Sidamo, Guatemala Antigua, or Papua New Guinea for the citrus-based recipes. ### Sweet Home Comfort - Coarsely grind pecans and cinnamon, finely chop 1/4 vanilla bean, and add all to the ground coffee for extraction while brewing. - Add sweetener (optional). - Add a splash of your favorite Bourbon (optional) - Sprinkle nutmeg on top - Serve hot, and don’t drive. ### Summer Citrus Cafe Cooler - Attain the zest of orange, lemon, and lime and add to the ground coffee for extraction while brewing. - Add sweetener (optional). - Serve iced. ### Cocoa Mint Melody - Muddle mint leaves and add them to the ground coffee for extraction while brewing. - Stir in ground cocoa and sweetener (optional). - Serve hot or iced.![Lemon and Lime zest](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/zest450.DxiI29ye_Z15t8X5.webp)_Lemon and Lime zest_### Suggested Ingredients - Real Vanilla Bean - Real Cinnamon Stick (ground as needed) - Ground Nutmeg - Ground Clove - Ground Cocoa - Ground Almonds - Ground Pecans - Cardamom - Real Fresh Mint or Spearmint - Fresh Orange Zest - Fresh Lemon Zest - Fresh Lime Zest Now you can drink flavored coffee and not only feel healthier but stand up and proudly say, “I have an addiction…I drink flavored coffee”! And the best part? None of your ristretto-pulling, home coffee roasting, coffee snob friends will be able to say anything.

# One Thousand and one Words about Turkish Coffee [Coffee History](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/coffee-history/)---by [Natasha Williams](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/natasha-williams/)![One Thousand and one Words about Turkish Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/one-thousand-and-one-words-about-turkish-coffee/Johann_Sebastian_Bach.jpg) ### A Best Friend And here it sits in front of me my little demitasse cup of bittersweet dark crown mud, my addiction, the best friend of my every lonely night when everyone on earth seems to be asleep and I have to stay up sharp to work, like tonight typing my thousand and one words about Turkish coffee. A sip of inspiration and let it flow….. ### Bach Remembered ….”Ah, how sweet coffee tastes! Lovelier than a thousand kisses, sweeter far than muscatel wine! I must have coffee….” these are the words from KAFFEE KANTATE composed by Johann Sebastian Bach in 1732. True, very true, but, alas, I don’t have his genius to celebrate coffee as well as he did. Instead, I can make a great cup for someone who does…![Johann Sebastian Bach](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/Johann_Sebastian_Bach.BwW0x5qw_Z11vKw5.webp)_Johann Sebastian Bach painting by Elias Gottlob Haussman_### Decaf Doesn’t Count What does humanity owe coffee besides this wonderful piece of music? I am afraid to even start speculating, or it may look like at least a millennium of our history is the way it is mostly due to the discovery of coffee. So, use your imagination and blame it all on coffee to the extent that you personally drink it. And keep in mind: DECAF DOESN’T COUNT. As for me, I drink it strong and heavy Turkish style, the way it has been drunk by at least twenty generations of devoted coffee drinkers all over the world. But let’s start at the beginning. ### From the Cradle Coffee came from the same place we now know as the cradle of humanity. Of course, you know ……….Africa. We don’t know much about its history prior to 1000 AD, but not because it had none, but simply because WE don’t know. The only thing that managed to slip into available records is the fact that members of certain Galla tribes in Ethiopia discovered a perfect remedy for lethargy: they took certain berries, ground them up, mixed them up with animal fat, took it and went and did what they were supposed to be doing. ### The dawning of the Coffee Age About 1000 AD, when some Arabs came traveling through, they must have looked a little too anemic to their African hosts. So, generous Africans supplied them with a good amount of magical berries which industrial Arab traders took back to their homeland and started cultivating the plant for the first time on plantations. Thus the COFFEE AGE BEGAN. ### The First Coffee Shop Alas, it took another four centuries to figure out that coffee drinking was a communal thing, and the first coffee shop in the world opened. They called it “Kiva Han” and it was opened in Constantinople in 1457 AD. I don’t know how it looked, but I know for sure that the way coffee was made there is exactly the same way I made it in my little cafe in Lexington, Kentucky, 538 years later. They brewed coffee in little pots called ibriks or cezves, invented in Egypt to cook coffee in hot sand but doing pretty good on the stove tops ever since, in Middle Eastern and Greek restaurants and in people’s homes all over the world. ### Importance You can judge the importance of coffee in 15th-century Turkey from the fact that at the time it became legal for a woman to divorce her husband if he failed to provide her with her daily coffee quota. “For better or for worse” but no morning coffee sounds like too much of a nightmare. Well, our husbands have nothing to fear — we work and earn enough to buy our own coffee, and for as long as they can pay for the rest of the dinner, our marriages are okay. Is coffee still a family value? For a family, it certainly is. ### Coffee Spreads in Europe For another two centuries, Europeans didn’t have the privilege of having a good conversation over a cup of this delicious stimulant in the company of total strangers until 1645 when the first coffeehouse opened in Italy, in 1652 in England, in 1672 in Paris, in 1721 in Berlin and on, and on, and on until there’s not a spot on the map where coffee doesn’t accompany all sorts of communications from the most intimate confessions to passionate political debates. ### American Grounds Captain John Smith, who helped found the colony of Virginia at Jamestown in 1607, introduced coffee to North America. Since then, the magic bean has been perfectly naturalized, acquired citizenship, and seems to be doing great business-wise. It has fully fulfilled the American dream of every immigrant: it makes billions of dollars, keeps Congress awake, and thus influences the politics of a major superpower.![Captain John Smith](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/captain-john-smith.DfeZK-lf_j8i2X.webp)_Captain John Smith_### Coffee Changes Many things have happened to coffee in its long journey through the ages. Every century has delicately added something new to the perfection of the art of coffee drinking until the 20th rushed in with its passion to improve everything to the point when the improved version has nothing to do with the original. Coffee was not the exception. In 1901, Japanese-American chemist Satori Kato of Chicago invented “instant” coffee, and there goes the little hand mill and the impatient waiting of a thirsty connoisseur for the little ibrik pot to boil. Instant coffee is like love-making without foreplay, a rape of taste, a satisfaction of physical urge without love. Just two years later, in l903, German coffee importer Ludwig Roselius turned a batch of roasted coffee beans over to researchers, who perfected the process of removing caffeine from the beans without destroying the flavor. And here comes Decaf– a zombie drink stripped of its soul. Not all of the innovations were that radical. In 1933, an Italian named Calimani developed an alternative coffee maker that separated coffee grounds from the liquid part of the drink without hurting its strength or flavor: The “presso” coffee maker. In 1946, another Italian, Achille Gaggia, perfected his espresso machine and created cappuccino, named for the color of the robes of the capuchin monks. Well, I use my presso when I am in a hurry, and I make a cappuccino when not on weight loss control. ### Conclusion Anyway, I am not really writing about all these other coffee drinks, not even the ones on our menu, not a delicious Abbot’s Cappuccino, made with fresh cream instead of milk, not about sweet Chococcino, not about Coffee Zebra or Coffee Kilimanjaro, not about the Dublin Mud made with Irish Cream liquor not about Cappuccino or Borjia shakes and definitely not about our famous Ivan the Terrible, the favorite of those who go for heavy caffeine. Neither am I writing about the history of coffee. All I was going to do was write a 1001-word passionate hymn of love to the best, the oldest, the most authentic of all, the one “sweeter than a thousand kisses,” to my favorite demitasse cup of Turkish coffee. Alas, I am way over 1001 words and I have not even started. Well, stop by “Natasha’s Cafe” and I’ll simply make you your first cup. Tasting is believing, isn’t it….PS I don’t know when and who designed Mr. Coffee. I don’t want to know. And if you know don’t tell me. This thing has nothing to do with coffee, and if you love coffee, YOU know why….. Published on July 28, 2014--- #### Natasha Williams Natasha and Gene own Natasha’s Cafe and Boutique in Lexington, Kentucky. It is a relaxed European style cafe with an active online business that features products for Turkish coffee. In their online boutique you’ll also find clothing, artifacts and exotic jewelry from around the world.

# Popper Roasting Tips [Roasting Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/roasting-coffee/)---by [Michael Allen Smith](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/michael-allen-smith/)![Popper Roasting Tips](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/popper-roasting-tips/cooling-coffee-beans.jpg) For those unfamiliar with roasting coffee using a popcorn popper, I strongly recommend reading Ryan Jacobs’ [Roast Your Own](https://ineedcoffee.com/roast-your-own-coffee/) tutorial before proceeding. That article provides a detailed step-by-step walk-through of the roasting process and is the perfect starting point for any new home coffee roaster. This article picks up where that one left off. Experience has given me a few minor enhancements to make home roasting in a popcorn popper even better. Like the original tutorial, these tips are also geared toward the beginner. The popper used in this tutorial is the West Bend 2. ### Yanking The Cord It didn’t take too many roasts before I got sick of pulling the cord out of the wall to stop the roast. Unlike other roasters such as the [Fresh Roast](https://ineedcoffee.com/home-roasting-coffee-with-the-fresh-roast/) or the [Hearthware](https://ineedcoffee.com/home-roasting-with-the-hearthware-precision/), the West Bend 2 has no OFF switch. _Note: the original West Bend Poppery does have an off switch._ The way to stop a roast is simply by pulling the cord out of the wall. Pulling on anything electrical isn’t my idea of fun. The simple solution is to get a dedicated power strip for the roaster. This will allow the roaster to manually turn on and off the roaster from a switch. Far more elegant, and if you’re roasting multiple batches, it becomes a slight time saver. ### Cooling the Beans Method 1 The common method of cooling beans is using a cookie tray and the wind. This works fine enough unless it’s a warm day without a breeze. In a previous article, we learned that [cold weather](https://ineedcoffee.com/cold-weather-coffee-roasting/ "Advice on roasting in the winter.") is an enemy of roasting. On the flip side, hot weather is the enemy of cooling. If the freshly roasted coffee doesn’t cool, it’s still roasting. And if it’s still cooking, the coffee will be over-roasted and flat. Cooling the beans quickly is essential to great-tasting coffee. I found that a perforated metal colander works best. Because of the dish shape, the roaster can shake the beans around more than on a flat tray. The perforations allow air to get to the beans and accelerate cooling. Another added benefit is that rolling the beans around will shake off some of the chaff.![cool the beans](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/cooling-coffee-beans.5d3plUYc_2iBUgj.webp)_Use a perforated metal colander to cool your coffee roast._### Cooling the Beans Method 2 The next cooling method is by spraying a light mist of cold water onto the beans immediately after the beans have been placed into the colander. Only use this method if you are in a very warm environment with minimal airflow. I used this method when I lived in Florida. A fine mist of cold water will evaporate immediately and cool the coffee beans. Don’t drench the beans; just lightly mist cold water over them. If your squirt bottle can’t mist, don’t use it. Anything more than a mist will do more harm than good. ### Chaff Removal A cool technique that I’ve read about, but never implemented is using a shop vac to remove the chaff. Holding a shop vac up to a perforated holding tray or colander will strip off any excess chaff. It has the added bonus of immediately cooling the beans. My guess is that this method would work extremely well for cooling [oven roasted coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/home-roasting-coffee-in-an-oven/) which doesn’t lose any of its chaff during the roasting process. ### Volume or Weight Coffee beans will vary in size from country to country. Although using the 1/2 cup rule is fine, you may achieve better results by measuring the coffee beans by weight. A small kitchen scale like the one shown below will work best. If you want to test your equipment’s accuracy, place 11 US pennies on the scale. It should measure exactly 1 ounce. The popper should be able to roast 4 ounces. Some models, such as the West Bend Poppery, can handle up to 5 ounces. Experiment and keep a journal to find your popper’s limitations. ### Conclusion Innovative ways exist to improve the home roasting process. As you gain experience with home roasting, you’ll be able to enjoy delicious, fresh home-roasted coffee and the joy of discovering new and creative techniques to improve your roasting processes. ### Resources [Roasting Coffee in a Popcorn Popper](https://ineedcoffee.com/roasting-coffee-in-a-popcorn-popper/) – A tutorial on roasting coffee using the West Bend Poppery.

# No Coffee or Tea For At Least 2 Weeks [Coffee and Health](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/coffee-health/)---by [Michael Allen Smith](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/michael-allen-smith/)![No Coffee or Tea For At Least 2 Weeks](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/no-coffee-or-tea-for-at-least-2-weeks/empty-espresso1.jpg) My new dentist then turned to me and said something I’ll never forget. > _No coffee or tea for at least two weeks._ Excuse me? > _You need to avoid coffee or tea for at least the next two weeks. If you do have coffee, you must drink it using a straw._ I messed up. I messed up bad. A few weeks ago I got a direct mail advertisement for a dentist offering new patients a free _Zoom!_ teeth whitening with the purchase of a cleaning and X-rays. Now that I’ve moved to the Seattle area, I needed a new dentist. I saw the _Zoom!_ machine on _Extreme Makeover_ and my favorite word is free. What could go wrong?![empty espresso](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/empty-espresso1.DvnM0m2V_hpFqt.webp)_Empty Espresso_ I didn’t ask any questions or do any research. Only after the procedure did I learn about the coffee and tea restrictions. Drinking coffee or tea after tooth bleaching can cause staining. The dentist was a little shocked that I left in a state of panic, wondering how I could drink espresso through a straw. Soon, I would find out. The _Zoom! Whitening_ procedure lasted almost an hour. After prepping the teeth, a bright light is focused on the teeth. Not exactly laser teeth whitening, but a cool technology. Oh, and did I mention the cost was free? According to the official site: > …Hydrogen Peroxide is broken down, oxygen enters the enamel and dentin, bleaching colored substances while the structure of the tooth is unchanged. The Zoom! light aids in activating the hydrogen peroxide and helps it penetrate the surface of the tooth. The procedure does cause some tingling with periods of sharp shooting pain. The price of beauty. My hunch was living with teeth sensitivity would be less traumatic than living with coffee restrictions. The first morning I pulled a shot of my latest espresso blend. Then, I did the unthinkable. I dropped a straw into the demitasse and started sipping. Maybe my TV memory is a little fuzzy, but I don’t recall ever seeing anyone on _Extreme Makeover_ drinking espresso through a straw. It was less than a satisfactory experience. ### The Longest Two Weeks Ever Having just moved to Seattle, I was in espresso heaven. The legends are true. Seattle has the best coffee of any place I’ve ever been to. Carrying a straw into some of the world’s top coffee houses was not an option. I’d have to figure out a _compromise_. My coffee schedule would not make it easy for me to avoid coffee. I was enrolled in a four-part coffee cupping class at _Victrola Coffee Roasters_ and also scored a ticket to Coffee Fest. This means not just a lot of espresso but a lot of excellent espressos. The straw idea was too silly, so I developed my own technique for sipping espresso that gets almost no coffee on the teeth: tilt head back, round tongue, and pour. It needs to be a little cooler in temperature. At one of the coffee cuppings, my class sampled the five different beans that made up the _Victrola Streamline Blend_ as individual espresso shots, and then we sampled the espresso blend itself. The exercise was to isolate the different flavors inside the blend. Since this was a cupping and most mortals probably shouldn’t drink six shots of espresso in an hour, they advise spitting the espresso into a cup. The tilt technique I had perfected minimized the coffee that touched my teeth. Spitting out the espresso would guarantee the espresso would coat my teeth on the exit. Not an option. Plus, the espresso was too tasty and could not be fully enjoyed. Six espressos later, and my teeth were still white as the driven snow. My heart was racing as I had just run a 100-meter dash, but I looked good. ### Results Well, except the first day, I didn’t drink my espresso using a straw during those two weeks. I didn’t even cut back on my coffee intake. I probably ended up consuming more. My tilt technique wasn’t perfect, but I did develop some slight coffee staining. In the end, my teeth ended up just slightly whiter than before. If I had to do it again, I would schedule the _Zoom!_ whitening during the summer (or use the Crest 3D strips) and drink iced lattes with a straw instead. I would also confirm that _Coffee Fest_ was not in town those two weeks. Published on July 30, 2012--- #### Michael Allen Smith Michael Allen Smith is both a coffee fanatic and a web developer.

# Organic Coffee – Your Cup o’ Joe? [Coffee Business](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/coffee-business/)---by [Eyal Rosen](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/eyal-rosen/)![Organic Coffee – Your Cup o’ Joe?](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/organic-coffee-your-cup-o-joe/coffee-cherries3.jpg) Organic crops, coffee included, are grown without synthetic fertilizer or artificial pesticides. This doesn’t mean though, that the coffee is free of fertilizer or pesticides. Growers just use natural fertilizers and natural insect repellents. An organic product is essential to many coffee drinkers because coffee is a highly pesticide-sprayed crop. Coffee beans are worth much more per pound than other products like wheat, corn, or soy, so farmers have an incentive to protect their crops and increase output with whatever pesticides and fertilizers work. Also, some pesticides that are banned in the United States and Europe are still used in other coffee-growing countries. Hence, there is a perception that organic coffee is healthy and natural. Many consumers reason that if they’re drinking a few cups a day of anything, it might just as well be pesticide-free. In his book “Espresso Coffee,” Andrea Lilly claims that the more advanced coffee growers, aware of the need for an environmental-friendly product, are using improved land management, organic fertilizers instead of synthetic ones, reduced pesticides, and reduced water use and pollution during post-harvest handling. These advanced coffee growers are certainly more likely to produce a higher quality product. ### So, should it be certified organic coffee? How about Fair Trade? Organic coffee is a fast-growing phenomenon. By now it is grown in more than 40 countries, including Hawaii. The fast growth is fueled by the universal organic food trend and by the rapid adoption of fair trade practices. Because of the quality of the farmers adopting fair trade practices, 60% of that coffee is certified organic. It is essential to note that there are quite a few organic coffees that are actually not certified. The certification procedure is notoriously difficult and expensive and demands certification along the whole food chain including not only the growers but also the roasters and even the truck drivers. Surely, this is way beyond the means of small farmers in developing countries such as Yemen and Ethiopia. Actually, in these countries, the coffee farmers are so poor they tend not to use pesticides or fertilizers at all.![coffee-cherries](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/coffee-cherries3.CBmgGn0h_Z2lpQsS.webp)_[Photo](https://www.flickr.com/photos/ljguitar/455706920/) by Larry Jacobsen_### Is organic coffee really healthier? Health-wise, you can’t go wrong with organic coffee. That does not mean though, that standard coffee is any worse. There are no studies comparing the health of standard coffee drinkers with organic coffee drinkers. It just might be the case that coffee, grown inside an actual fruit, may not be as vulnerable to synthetic substances, as other fruits. ### Is the quality of the coffee better at all? So, if you are just looking for a superior cup, certified organic might be the way to go, but there are other (cheaper) ways, too. If you are looking to make a statement, though, certified organic coffee is certainly a good way to do it. ### Sources OTA – Organic Coffee – (page removed November 2014) [Are Fair Trade Certified products also certified organic?](https://www.fairtradecertified.org/get-certified/frequently-asked-questions/) Published on March 1, 2009--- #### Eyal Rosen [Follow Eyal Rosen on X](https://x.com/eyalrosen1)From the Jerusalem Post: “A self-proclaimed ‘coffee geek,’ Eyal Rosen recently traveled all over the world visiting coffee houses in search of the ultimate cup of coffee for his forthcoming book, Coffee Tales.

# Picking Your Top 10 Coffee Accessories (2009) [Brewing Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/brewing-coffee/)---by [Michael Allen Smith](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/michael-allen-smith/)![Picking Your Top 10 Coffee Accessories (2009)](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/picking-your-top-10-coffee-accessories/pino-digital-tea-kettle1.jpg) INeedCoffee contributor Eyal Rosen recently created a list of the top 10 accessories for coffee. The page is no longer online. There will be little disagreement on a few items on the list. - **Coffee Grinder** – Amen! The path to every great cup of coffee starts with the grinder. - **Permanent Gold Coffee Filter** – If you like drip coffee, I agree that this should be on your Top 10 Coffee Accessories list. - **French Press** – Penny for penny it is the best coffee brewing system ever invented. No disagreement from me. This belongs on the list. - **Espresso machine and coffee maker cleaner powder** – Yes, but with a caveat. I personally **love** espresso, and if a fire broke out, I’d probably grab my espresso machine as I headed out the door. _My guests can walk themselves out._ 🙂 However, I do not like espresso machines under $500. Setting up an espresso savings fund would be a better idea. I would never include a few on Eyal’s list in the Top 10 Coffee Accessories. - **Coffee pods holster for a Keurig coffee maker** – I don’t own, nor desire to ever own, a single-serve pod coffee machine. - **Handheld Milk frother** – I had one of these many years ago. Junk. A good espresso machine will make this accessory obsolete. - **Handpresso** – I think this was listed as a joke. I’ve never played with one, so I will reserve judgment on how good it is. I suspect it doesn’t belong on a Top 10 Coffee Accessories List. The MyPressi seems like a better option for campers hell-bent on getting espresso shots with enough atmospheric pressure while “roughing it” in the outdoors. What would I add to my Top 10 Coffee Accessories List that didn’t make Eyal’s list? - **Electric Kettle**—It is essential to quickly heat water for coffee. Don’t waste your precious moments on Earth waiting for water to boil. Get a good [electric kettle](https://ineedcoffee.com/avoiding-plastic-3-stainless-steel-electric-kettle-options/). - **Espresso Knock Box**—I have to confess that I went a long time without a knock box. I was a fool. If you have an espresso machine, get a decent knock box. - **Eva Solo**—Very few people seem to know about the Eva Solo, my favorite non-Espresso coffee brewer. Check out the [Eva Solo Coffee Brewing Tutorial](https://ineedcoffee.com/eva-solo-coffee-brewing-tutorial/) to learn more about this brewer.![Pino Digital Tea kettle](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/pino-digital-tea-kettle1.1MFTFGGm_Z2lqncJ.webp)*PINO Digital Kettle Pro *### Resources Top 10 Coffee Accessories List – Eyal’s original list.

# Pan Roasting Coffee [Roasting Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/roasting-coffee/)---by [CB Miller](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/cb-miller/)![Pan Roasting Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/pan-roasting-coffee/pan1.gif) You can admit it here, we won’t laugh. You want to roast your own beans. There now, doesn’t that feel better? It’s not a crazy idea. Green beans are far less expensive than those roasted ahead of time and can be safely stored for up to two years without loss of flavor. By roasting your own you also know you’re getting the freshest possible cup of coffee. As far as the flavor of your coffee, well that depends a lot on you. If you favor the light roasts you will find it very difficult to approximate their flavors using the pan method. If you favor the darker styles, you stand a good chance of success simply by using a common skillet.![pan roasting coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/pan1.CZ19J96-_Z18VeGQ.webp)_Pan roasting coffee._### Want to get started? Okay, start by selecting from the hundreds of green beans that are available on the Internet. Then take a common skillet and place it on a burner set to high. You need a temperature of approximately 500F to roast coffee. When the skillet has heated sufficiently, pour the beans in and begin shaking. This is the first key – never let the beans come to rest on the pan surface. If you do they will burn. As you shake you will begin to notice the beans changing color, from olive green to a yellow-green hue. The second key is wrist strength: you will have to keep the beans moving in the skillet for at least six, up to approximately nine minutes, and perhaps much longer (depending on the roast style you prefer). If you can keep the pan shaking at the 6-9 minute mark you will hear the beans begin to pop. This is what the roasters call “First Crack”. Once this crackling stops the beans should have turned a light, golden brown and you may stop. If you do you have what many call a New England Roast. If you’re experimenting go ahead and stop and, when they’ve cooled, grind these freshly roasted beans and sample the results. Be exact. Precisely measure the amount of ground coffee and water you use, and then take notes on the flavors you perceive in the cup. If you know you want a darker roast when that first crackling stops keep shaking. The longer you go the easier it is to burn the beans so shake it baby, shake it. The beans will be getting darker and darker and at some point, you will hear the “Second Crack”. Get ready now, when the crackling stops this time you will be at what is called “Full City Roast”. There was a time when the ‘chore’ of roasting coffee was replaced by the ubiquitous can. In a world where clothes were still scrubbed by hand, anything that lessened the labors of life was seen as an improvement. But today we have the luxury to choose to make our own pasta, bake our own bread, or roast our own coffee. Today we realize that though it is often a lot of work, it is well worth the effort to revisit the days of the home-grown, the hand-made, the home-roasted. Published on July 1, 2001--- #### CB Miller Small coffee roasters are perking up all over the country, recreating styles and blends which were nearly impossible to find just a few years ago. The quality of these blends remains unparalleled by those of the giant coffee companies. However, it is difficult to experience these wonderfully fresh roasted coffees because the roasters are scattered all over the country.

# Hacking the Orville Redenbacher Hot Air Popper to Roast Coffee [Roasting Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/roasting-coffee/)---by [Sam Hampton](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/sam-hampton/)![Hacking the Orville Redenbacher Hot Air Popper to Roast Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/poplite-coffee-roaster/ineed-coffee-PopLite-article_html_m250080ad.jpg) Looking for information on coffee roasting machines, I felt exhausted trying to find the “perfect” popper on eBay, which was out of my price range, or in the local thrift stores, which had not seen a West Bend popper in years. WB Poppery and Poppery II are, by everyone’s estimation, two great modifiable machines that will roast coffee beans. I looked at the post dates on the articles, and most were printed from 2005 to 2011. Here I am in August of 2014, trying to find a roaster. After searching for months, I came across the Presto PopLite, which looked like it could roast coffee. But it was listed as a probable no show by Sweet Maria’s and, if possible, one model to avoid. I came across the INeedCoffee article [The Poplite Air Popper: a Cheap Home Coffee Roaster](https://ineedcoffee.com/the-poplite-air-popper-a-cheap-home-coffee-roaster/) by Eugene Hanks that said with modification, the PopLite was a good coffee roaster. I read the article several times and within a week had located one in a thrift store for $3.99, my price to try and modify. The model was 4821 (the Orville Redenbacher gourmet). ### Slowing Down the Roast The first roast in the Orville Redenbacher PopLite was quick. The 1440 watts heated up the beans so quickly to 1st crack and 2nd crack that the roast was over before I had time to evaluate it or really think about it. I noticed a little scorching of the beans in the first minute of the roast. I read several articles on the PopLite and was amazed at the number of innovations and procedures worked out by roasters to solve the various problems associated with the PopLite roaster. The first was the speed of the roast. Dropping the voltage by adding an extension cord seemed to work out by prolonging the roasting cycle. I solved this problem by getting a Router Speed Control from Harbor Freight for $17.00 (net price on sale and 20% off coupon). The router control lowered the speed of the fan and heating element, so it takes longer for the beans to roast. The only downside was the lowered fan speed required agitation of the beans in the roasting chamber. ### Preventing Scorching The next problem was the scorching. The dip in the roasting chamber and lower fan speed were the cause. I solved this by disassembling the popper and inserting a light wire screen to flatten out the bottom of the roasting chamber. The screen fits under the aluminum popping chamber, where it is inserted into the base heating unit. The screen gave an additional half-inch of space between the round heat orifice and the beans at the bottom of the roasting chamber, which allowed the heat to dissipate just enough and not scorch the beans during the first part of the roast. The screen makes the beans easier to stir. When it was necessary to agitate the beans with the top on the popper, it seemed to require three hands, and agitation was necessary as the beans needed to be stirred or agitated during the first few minutes of the roast cycle while the beans were still heavy with moisture. The roasters at Browngrounds.com used gloves to manhandle and shake the hot PopLite popper during this part of the roasting cycle to agitate the beans. This solved the problem for them and gave them a nice even repeatable roast. The top also needed to be in place later in the roasting cycle to keep the beans from being blown out of the roasting chamber, as the beans lost moisture and became lighter. I solved both of these problems with a 5 by 7-inch plate display hanger from Home Depot ($2.98). I cut the hanger wire into two separate spring holders and hooked it on each side of the PopLite to hold the top on. ### Measuring Roast Temperature During the first days of my roasting adventure, I used a thermometer to check the heat of the roasting chamber and learned what, when, and where the 1st and 2nd cracks occurred. The thermometer was located in the chamber against the aluminum sleeve. It registered cooler than the ambient temperature of the beans but gave a reliable indication of what was happening during the roast. I was able, with observation, to find out when 1st and 2nd cracks occurred and relate this in a chart to the information from Sweet Maria’s and others as to what kind of roast I was getting. By having control over the heat and fan and the ability to agitate when needed, I am able to use the Orville Redenbacher PopLite to achieve a repeatable roast to the level I desire, all for less than $25.00 and no unusual modifications to speak of. The photographs are commented on, but If you have any questions, let me know.![thermometer ](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/ineed-coffee-PopLite-article_html_m66686881.ClGBvA-w_21LOye.webp)![mount thermometer](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/ineed-coffee-PopLite-article_html_2ce45118.CFQD6NTF_Z18ldHO.webp) I wanted to mount a thermometer without having to bore a hole in the Orville Redenbacher PopLite. I used a wooden batten to mount the thermometer inside the chamber as shown. The pocket thermometer is a 50-550 deg F unit I got for $5.00 sometime before and have used it in roasting coffee and my BBQ pit. ### The Modification![poplite bottom](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/ineed-coffee-PopLite-article_html_m7b76612.BXQCjKWA_13jKOT.webp)![poplite remove bottom](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/ineed-coffee-PopLite-article_html_5dc170fd.B9uxviSj_Z1zhby9.webp)![poplite side remove](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/ineed-coffee-PopLite-article_html_39b42426.Cu6NCMxU_Z1Xqk4s.webp)![poplite place screen](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/ineed-coffee-PopLite-article_html_m40f76c57.BBmcCUXx_1O3sok.webp) The seemingly most difficult part of fixing up the Orville Redenbacher PopLite is putting a screen at the bottom of the roasting chamber. You do not need to do this if you are not scorching beans. Take out the four screws on the bottom. Mark the orientation of the bottom of the plate for reassembly (so you will know how to put the popper back together). The heating and fan are shown in the second photograph. Carefully take out the unit. It is not necessary to disconnect the electrical cord. Carefully twist the cord around and set the unit on the table. Holding the bottom unit, twist and remove the aluminum roasting chamber from the heating and fan unit.![poplite aluminum ](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/ineed-coffee-PopLite-article_html_m3673cd65.zBTquyma_ZkakLf.webp) Take a light piece of aluminum (uncoated) screen wire material and place it over the heating and fan unit. Replace the aluminum roasting chamber over the screen and with a little pressure reseat the chamber into the heating and fan unit.![poplite invert](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/ineed-coffee-PopLite-article_html_6f5d730c-650x486.0rMq35nY_Z1iLtwB.webp) It may be necessary to invert the unit and apply pressure to make sure the chamber unit is reseated and the screen wire is tight in the bottom.![trim wire screen](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/ineed-coffee-PopLite-article_html_m557ac66.BjYuoI9Z_2m3NXV.webp)![poplite aluminum chamber](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/ineed-coffee-PopLite-article_html_d9b58c6.CB2lGUom_dUIr1.webp)![poplite screen in place](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/ineed-coffee-PopLite-article_html_m7a1cfb24.CNIK_LWS_Z1E6jUC.webp) Trim the screen wire close to the outside of the chamber and reassemble the unit. Take care to make sure the unit is put back together with the way it was taken apart.![plate hanger](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/ineed-coffee-PopLite-article_html_57b3705f-650x437.Dya0kBcD_15NMtQ.webp)![poplite with hood](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/ineed-coffee-PopLite-article_html_m32fe8eef.BA4LS503_Z6cx2b.webp) The plate holder wire is cut in two places. One wire is bent down and the other end up to retain the spring. Clip the unit under the lip of the top of the roaster and over the top of the clear plastic guard. ### Variable Power![poplite with controller](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/ineed-coffee-PopLite-article_html_m250080ad.CEyqS-ny_21NXxL.webp)![controller](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/ineed-coffee-PopLite-article_html_a4d7d40.4vEcpH4q_2utaWz.webp) The heating and fan are controlled by a router speed control unit from Harbor Freight. This unit is really neat in that you can, with the flick of a switch; change from full power to variable power. One thing to note: the line between black and green is 50% power. The line between green and red is 75% power. The unit is rated for 15 amps and should support any popper with which you wish to roast. The beans will probably need to be agitated (stirred) when the fan power is reduced to prevent scorching or burning. Agitation also allows the chaff to separate from the beans, so stirring during the complete roasting cycle does wonders for your beans and evens out the roast. The more you agitate the better. You can use a small flashlight to view the beans while roasting.![completed poplite roaster](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/poplite650.BeBhYA3Y_1CC2b6.webp) The completed roaster is ready for duty, and many good roasts are to come.**Do not operate a roster that is unattended!

# Poppery Hopper Modification [Roasting Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/roasting-coffee/)---by [Rama R](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/rama-r/)![Poppery Hopper Modification](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/poppery-hopper-modification/poppery-finished.jpg)**Background: [Roasting Coffee in a Popcorn Popper](https://ineedcoffee.com/roasting-coffee-in-a-popcorn-popper/)** I picked up a 1500 Watt West Bend Poppery on eBay a year ago to roast my own coffee in the backyard (roasting generates tons of chaff and smoke, so if you go ghetto with a popcorn popper, a backyard is a must.) I’m largely pleased with it. The cooler months require a [little extra insulation](https://ineedcoffee.com/cold-weather-coffee-roasting/), by way of a giant box enclosing the whole assembly, in order to reach proper temperature. The hopper/chamber was designed to eject the popcorn into a bowl once it became light enough, which is sort of problematic with coffee. An unmodified Poppery will lose maybe 5-10% of the beans over the course of the roast when roasting 4 ounces at a time. Sitting next to the roaster and quickly tossing ejectees back into the chamber became tiresome, so I cut the top and bottom off a soup can and crammed it in to act as a chimney. Bean-overboard problem fixed, but the friction fit can be ugly and always shifting around. While cleaning out the garage today, I came across a **tin flower pot** (the kind you see for a few dollars at Trader Joe’s) I was about to toss it into the recycle bin when I realized it was the ideal shape for a Poppery chimney! A quick dry-fit later showed it was indeed the ideal size and shape- all that was needed was to chop off the bottom and secure it to the Poppery. In my excitement, I didn’t think to take more photos of the process, but it’s really straightforward. Use tinsnips to remove the bottom of the pot, about 1/2″ above the bottom for this particular diameter tin. Remove the plastic housing from the Poppery. Drill and pop rivet the tin to the chamber:![poppery rivet](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/poppery-rivet1.DcHmm1uT_ZBrniw.webp)_Add the rivet into the chamber._ I toyed with the idea of leaving it “naked” since it looks so industrial and cool, but dealing with a 400F+ chamber and having to fashion a new place to mount the on/off switch was enough to convince me not to. Perhaps someday I’ll swing by Tap Plastics and fashion a clear housing.

# Panama Esmeralda: The Ultimate Push Gift? [Cafe Culture](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/cafe-culture/)---by [Ryan Jacobs](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/ryan-jacobs/)![Panama Esmeralda: The Ultimate Push Gift?](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/panama-esmeralda-the-ultimate-push-gift/panama-esmerlada-stumptown1.jpg) My wife and I are expecting our first child any day. Or any minute. Or any second. I need something to occupy my mind, which is why I am writing this. Among the many new terms and traditions, I have learned during the pregnancy is ‘The Push Gift’. I had no idea there was such a thing, and honestly I am not sure my wife did either until she started reading the various baby sites online. In a nutshell, this is something that the husband is to give his wife after carrying and pushing the baby through labor. Not knowing what is an appropriate gift is not a problem. There is no shortage of ‘helpful’ websites that can assist you with ideas. Like most things directed to new parents, most are either too extravagant for our tastes or too impersonal. One day during the second trimester, my wife, who had given up coffee cold turkey once pregnant, suggested that freshly roasted coffee would be perfect. Of course, I always roast coffee, so I thought I should at least try to find something a bit more special. I was able to obtain a pound of _Panama Esmeralda Gesha – Lot 2 Caballeriza_ green coffee from _Sweet Maria’s_ during the summer. It is a rare bean that has received many wonderful tasting reviews. One of the notes on the bag of coffee says, ‘a one-of-a-kind flavor’. Sounds like a winner to me.![Panama Esmeralda](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/panama-esmerlada-stumptown1.B48b_86i_1FTI5N.webp)_Panama Esmeralda @ Stumptown_ Now that our baby is two days late, I thought it would be a good time to roast a small batch in anticipation that she will be ready to drink it soon and that the coffee will be at peak flavor. After over eight months of being deprived of all coffee, I believe that for my wife, this will be the ultimate push gift. ### Addendum After the baby was born, my wife agreed it was the perfect gift for her and quite possibly the best coffee she has had. I was able to sample it and thought it was up there on my list as well. The only better coffee I ever had was perfectly brewed coffee using a Clover at Intelligentsia in Chicago.

# Perfect Iced Coffee in 2 Minutes with The Coldwave Beverage Chiller [Brewing Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/brewing-coffee/)---by [Michael Allen Smith](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/michael-allen-smith/)![Perfect Iced Coffee in 2 Minutes with The Coldwave Beverage Chiller](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/perfect-iced-coffee-2-minutes-coldwave-beverage-chiller/coldwave-beverage-chiller.jpg) This might be the easiest coffee brewing tutorial ever. Recently, I had an opportunity to make iced coffee using the Coldwave. It is a game-changer if you love iced coffee, but are tired of weighing out ice cubes each time you brew.![coldwave coffee chiller](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/coldwave-coffee.BJt_n-sn_Z2rJx3W.webp)_Coldwave Beverage Chiller_### Iced Coffee vs Cold Brew Coffee A quick reminder of the difference between iced coffee and cold brew. Cold-brew is far more common these days. It is a lengthy brew process that takes 12-24 hours where coffee grounds are exposed to cold or room temperature water. This method of brewing produces a low-acidity coffee with a smooth body. Cold brewing coffee will alter the taste of the coffee being used. It doesn’t taste like a cold version of the same hot coffee. That is where iced coffee comes in. Iced coffee is brewed by flash-cooling coffee. The way this is done is by dividing the water used in the brewing process. About half of the hot water that makes contact with the beans. The other half is measured out in ice cubes. When the brewed coffee touches the ice, it is chilled instantly. And the key here is it doesn’t taste watery or weak. If you get your math right, it will taste very close to a cold version of the same coffee brewed hot. ### The Problem With Iced Coffee To make a really good cup of iced coffee, you will need to get your math right. You’ll be weighing both the hot water added to the brew and the weight of the ice cubes. If you get everything right, which can take some practice, you’ll get a delicious cup of perfectly chilled coffee that tastes just like the cold version of the same beverage brewed hot. However, if you have too few ice cubes, the coffee might be over-extracted and need additional ice to chill. The coffee will likely taste weak if you use too many ice cubes. When we brew coffee, we often want the process to be as simple as possible. We don’t want to do any math. We want to wake up. ### Enter the Coldwave Coffee Chiller Many years ago, I lived in a house in Florida without air conditioning. I’d brew a mug of French Press coffee, and it would take forever to cool down. One morning, I solved the problem by putting the ceramic mug in the freezer and pulling it out after the coffee was finished brewing. When I poured the hot coffee into the frozen mug, the temperature dropped instantly to a manageable level. And unlike adding ice to cool my coffee, my coffee never got watery. The Coldwave Coffee Chiller is a grander vision of my frozen mug experiment. The Coldwave is a super-fast beverage chiller. We are going to use it for coffee, but it could be used for tea. You can even chill beer quickly, although you may lose some of the carbonation, so pour slowly. The Coldwave is two parts. First, there is an insert which is a collection of rods that are ideal for freezing. The second part is a pitcher. Let’s make some iced coffee. ### #1 Freeze the Coldwave Chiller You’ll want to keep the Coldwave Chiller in the freezer, so it is ready to use at any time. The initial freeze can take 8 hours. Refreezing is much quicker and just requires an hour after chilling two batches. You can store the pitcher in the freezer, but the makers of Coldwave state this will increase the time it takes to freeze. If you do put the pitcher in the freezer, be sure to dry it completely first. ### #2 Brew Coffee However You Like This is the best part of this brewer.

# French Press Coffee Tutorial [Brewing Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/brewing-coffee/)---by [Michael Allen Smith](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/michael-allen-smith/)![French Press Coffee Tutorial](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/press-pot-tutorial/french-press-coffee-tutorial.jpg) Of all the different coffee brewing methods, the one I’ve used the most is the French Press. Also known as a press pot or Melior, the French Press is a simple way to make a rich, delicious cup of coffee. The French Press is a low-tech portable coffee brewing method. Let hot water steep over coarsely ground coffee for 3-4 minutes before pressing down the filter and serving. It doesn’t get more simple than that. This tutorial will go into the grind, water temperature, steep time, and fixing common issues when the brew is less than perfect.![glass french press empty](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/french-press-empty.CyxU53BW_Zc2bKk.webp) ### #1 Dosing The Coffee By weight or by volume? Weighing will give you more repeatable results than using volume, as there can be more variance measuring when using tablespoons than a gram scale. However, the French Press is forgiving, so either method is satisfactory. We will cover both methods. #### Measure By Weight There is no consensus on the ideal brewing ratio for the French Press. Before putting this tutorial together, I visited the recommendations of many roasters and discovered ratios between 10:1 and 18:1. When I threw out the outliers and averaged the rest. The ratio came out to 15.5:1. That means 15.5 grams of water for every 1 gram of coffee. The ranges were so different, which suggests that French Press coffee can taste great using different measurements and that precision is less important than in other brewing methods. #### Measure By Volume Going by volume, a good starting point is to use one tablespoon of coffee for every four fluid ounces of water. Some stronger recipes say one tablespoon of coffee for every 3 ounces. You may increase the amount of coffee to your desired taste. Below is a general range to get you started. - Bodum 3 cup (12 oz) = 3-4 tablespoons - Bodum 4 cup (17 oz) = 4-5 tablespoons - Bodum 8 cup (34 oz) = 9-10 tablespoons - Bodum 12 cup (51 oz) = 13-15 tablespoons ### #2 Grind Coffee and Heat Water Before you start grinding the coffee, heat some water. The French Press uses a coarse grind. See the photo below.![French Press coffee Grind by US nickel](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/2-french-press-grind.UpzKzpJV_Z72YY4.webp)_From the [Coffee Grind Chart](https://ineedcoffee.com/coffee-grind-chart/)_### #3 Add Coffee and Water to French Press Add the ground coffee to the French Press. Once the water reaches a boil, wait about 30 seconds before pouring it onto the coffee. This will lower the temperature from boiling to around 200° F, which is ideal for brewing. Start a timer and pour water onto the coffee grounds. When you pour the water into the French Press, there may be a bloom at the top where the coffee is either clumped or does not make contact with the water. You can minimize that by pouring slowly and controlled.![add coffee to empty french press](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/french-press-plunger-on-side.DGDV9okL_Z1LA7Xx.webp)![add hot water to french press ](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/french-press-add-water.Ck4dJdNp_1RYxKU.webp) ### #4 Stir (or not) Even if you pour slowly, coffee grounds might clump at the top and not be in contact with water. A gentle stir will solve that problem. I used to stir the entire French Press. That is not necessary. Just stir the top inch. Use a chopstick or spoon. Some will advise using a wooden spoon as there have been cases where a metal spoon has cracked the glass of the French Press. But if you are gentle, that shouldn’t be a concern. The goal here is to get all the coffee-making contact with water. After this, place the plunger on top of the coffee pot in the up position. This will minimize heat loss. Don’t press down yet.![french press coffee steeping](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/french-press-steeping.Bq-JFLOR_ZYN21k.webp) ### #5 After 3-4 Minutes, Press Down Slowly The recommended brew time for the French Press ranges from 2.5 to 6 minutes, with 4 minutes being the most commonly cited time. I have brewed thousands of French Press pots and prefer 3.5 minutes. It is full extraction and rich without being too heavy. Fellow INeedCoffee contributor Chris Arnold likes 2.5 minutes. At the other end of the spectrum, Seattle Coffee Works advises a 6-minute steep for Indonesian coffees (4 minutes for other beans). This will come down to personal preference. Beyond all the debates about optimal brewing times, the reality is that in the kitchen, we can easily become distracted while waiting for our coffee to finish brewing. The longer the brew time, the more opportunities for distraction. Aiming for a 3—to 3.5-minute brew time has worked much better for me than the 4—to 6-minute range. When it comes time to press the plunger down, be gentle, slow, and even. It should have some resistance, but not too much. You might need to grind a little finer if there is no resistance. If it is too hard to press down, use a coarser grind.![french press coffee plunging](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/french-press-plunging.snJO59SM_2jtSWq.webp) ### #6 Serve Coffee Pour and enjoy. French Press coffee will have some sediment. I usually leave 1/2-1 inch of coffee in the press pot to minimize getting that grit. I also don’t drink the last mouthful of each mug. The sediment doesn’t bother me, but I’d like to end each mug of coffee where the first sip tastes as good as the last sip, so I avoid the last few drops.![french press coffee finished](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/french-press-finished.ChEnqae6_ZtHIs9.webp) ### Troubleshooting Bad Coffee Beginners can make some mistakes early on that may result in less-than-optimal coffee. Below is a list of some common press pot problems and my solution. #### Coffee Tastes Weak The grind is most likely too coarse. Grind the coffee a little finer. Also, make sure you allow the coffee to steep for 3-4 minutes. #### Coffee Tastes Bitter The coffee may have been ground too fine. Next time, use a coarser grind. If the coffee is dark roasted, make sure it is fresh and lower the brewing temperature to 195 F. #### Coffee Taste Too Strong Use a 3-minute steep. Don’t let the brewed coffee sit inside the glass beaker brewing. Move it from the press pot to a thermal container, or brew what you need. Also, if you’ve been accustomed to drinking drip coffee, press pot coffee will taste richer at first. #### Gritty/Thick Sediment This could be a problem with the filter. Coffee sediment will go into the upper chamber if the filter doesn’t fit snugly against the glass. Filters can become damaged. You can purchase replacement filters. #### Sediment Woes If everything tastes right but the sediment is bothering you, consider purchasing the Espro Press, which has a tighter filter than traditional French Press coffee brewers. Another option is to cut up a paper filter, as shown in this hack. #### Water Takes Too Long to Boil I feel your pain. Boil only the amount needed for your press pot—don’t completely fill your kettle. If heating the water takes too long, consider getting an electric kettle. An electric kettle is one of the best investments you can make.![bonavita electric kettle for making coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/bonavita-kettle.6OUrnQ9M_2kwG15.webp) *Bonavita Electric Kettle *#### Inconsistent Grind My guess is you have one of those $20 blade grinders. Some of the coffee is coarsely ground, and some are fine ground. Getting an excellent grind from a blade grinder takes practice. Buying a burr grinder is ultimately a better solution._This discussion has been expanded into a full article: [Troubleshooting French Press Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/troubleshooting-french-press-coffee/)._### Cleaning The stainless steel French press is easy to disassemble and clean. Although it’s unnecessary to disassemble before cleaning, every so often, you would want to give your press pot a complete cleaning. For more instructions, read [Keeping Your French Press Clean](https://ineedcoffee.com/keeping-your-french-press-clean/). For day-to-day cleaning, I give my brewer a quick rinse. Occasionally, I will disassemble the parts and do a more thorough cleaning. ### Final Thoughts Once you’ve dialed in the grind and the dosage, the French Press is a straightforward way to make great coffee. if you don’t have a French Press already, check out [Buying a French Press – Picking the Right One](https://ineedcoffee.com/buying-a-french-press-picking-the-right-one/).

# Pour Over Coffee Using the Nee Coffee Dripper [Brewing Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/brewing-coffee/)---by [Michael Allen Smith](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/michael-allen-smith/)![Pour Over Coffee Using the Nee Coffee Dripper](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/pour-over-coffee-using-the-nee-coffee-dripper/nee-water-weigh.jpg) The Nee Coffee Dripper is a porcelain manual coffee brewer. This brewer might be right if you want a simple way to make a single cup of coffee. To make pour-over coffee, you will need a kettle to heat water and a #2 size paper filter. I also recommend a kitchen scale to weigh the coffee and the water. If you don’t have a scale, don’t be concerned; you can still make a great cup of coffee with the Nee Coffee Dripper. ### #1 Heat Water and Insert Filter Heat enough water for a cup of coffee and some extra to rinse the filter. Place the #2 filter inside the Nee Coffee Dripper.![Add filter to Nee Dripper](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/nee-filter-624x650.DavHfG9G_ekPTW.webp) ### #2 Rinse Filter (optional) You can rinse the filter before brewing. Most coffee professionals advise doing this step, which removes any paper residue taste and also preheats the porcelain dripper. But you don’t have to. Feel free to skip this step if you can’t detect paper taste in a non-rinsed filter. ### #3 Add Ground Coffee For pour-over coffee, I am using a [medium drip grind](https://ineedcoffee.com/coffee-grind-chart/). How strong or weak you like your coffee is up to you. I start with a 17 to 1 ratio. That means 17 grams of water per 1 gram of coffee. I shared this rule in the [Coffee Sock article](https://ineedcoffee.com/brewing-coffee-coffee-sock/), which applies here. - A 12-ounce mug of coffee is 340 grams. - Divide 340 by 17, and you get 20 grams of coffee. - That little scoop that comes in a can of coffee holds 10 grams. - So two scoops per 12-ounce mug. - If you have a 16-ounce mug, add another 1/2 a scoop. - If you have an 8-ounce mug, subtract 1/2 a scoop.![coffee scoop](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/scoop.CqYrJKEh_1iBuc6.webp) ### #4 Add Hot Water Bring water to a boil and let it cool for 10-30 seconds. Then slowly pour enough water to cover the grounds and let them bloom. Wait 30 seconds, and then resume pouring the hot water over the grounds. If you are using a scale, knowing when to stop adding water will be easy. If you aren’t, pausing and lifting the Nee Dripper to see how much coffee has passed into the mug is OK. Just be careful not to overfill the mug.![nee-water-weigh](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/nee-water-weigh-650x568.Dp4oKdPv_xdJBT.webp) ### #5 Serve Lift off the Nee Dripper and serve. Cleanup is nothing more than removing the filter and a quick rinse of the brewer.![nee-finished-brew](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/nee-finished-brew-650x519.CHFxcKIP_1pm1Kt.webp) There you go—a simple way to make a single cup pour-over at home._Disclosure: INeedCoffee received a Nee Coffee Dripper from Nee Coffee to complete this tutorial._ Published on June 19, 2015--- #### Michael Allen Smith Michael Allen Smith is both a coffee fanatic and a web developer.

# Pour Over Coffee Tutorial [Brewing Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/brewing-coffee/)---by [Michael Allen Smith](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/michael-allen-smith/)![Pour Over Coffee Tutorial](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/pour-coffee-tutorial/pour-over-coffee-tutorial.jpg) In this tutorial, we will be making pour-over coffee using the Coffesto Pour Over. The Coffesto is an inexpensive stainless steel pour-over brewer that does not require a paper filter. Although we will be using the Coffesto, the principles in this tutorial can be applied to other pour-over brewers. ### Brewing Setup The Coffesto filter will rest inside a holder placed directly above whatever you wish to brew your coffee into. I’ll be using an electric kettle and a digital scale, but I also provide guidance should you not have a scale. Included with the brewer is a one-tablespoon scoop. - 21 grams of coffee (or three level scoops) - 310 grams of water (11 ounces)![](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/coffesto-01-650x433.B8PxrQkz_ZTlh2v.webp) ### #1 Heat Water Fill your kettle with clean water. I love the _Bonavita Gooseneck_ kettle for two reasons. First, I can set the exact temperature I want to use, and second, the gooseneck spout provides me with excellent control over the water flow. This means I can distribute the hot water evenly over the coffee grounds. ### #2 Hot Water Rinse the Brewer and Your Mug Give the brewer and your mug a hot water rinse to minimize heat loss. ### #3 Setup the Brewer Place the stand over your mug and then the filter inside the stand. A 12-ounce mug will be ideal, although you can always brew less and use a smaller mug.![](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/coffesto-03-650x410.BfOJc3Uw_ZgpuBU.webp) ### #4 Add Ground Coffee to Brewer Add three scoops or 21 grams of [medium-fine](https://ineedcoffee.com/coffee-grind-chart/) ground coffee inside the pour-over.![](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/coffesto-04-650x433.D4K2nkea_1XoE2H.webp) ### #5 Add Enough Hot Water to Bloom A rule of thumb I use for brewing temperature is higher for lighter roasts and lower for darker roasts. I explain this more in the article [Hacking Dark Roast – Tips on Brewing a Better Bold Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/hacking-dark-roast-tips-on-brewing-a-better-bold-coffee/). - 205 F – light roasts - 200 F – medium roasts - 195 F – dark roasts Initially, you will pour just enough water to cover the beans. This typically works out to 2-3 times the weight of the ground coffee, for this example, 42-63 grams of water. You will see the coffee bloom as the gas escapes the beans. When you do this, pour and try your best to cover all the ground coffee. Ideally, there should be no dry clumps of coffee. It is better to add a little more water than to have dry clumps. Wait 30 seconds.![](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/coffesto-05-650x433.DXZT6Uva_Z1ioDjJ.webp) ### #6 Continue Adding Hot Water Slowly Slowly pour the remainder of the water over the ground coffee. The entire brewing process will take 2:30 – 4 minutes. Darker roasted coffees tend to brew faster, while lighter coffees tend to brew slower.![](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/coffesto-06-650x433.DPc2JWfB_ZBakhJ.webp) ### #7 Remove Brewer and Enjoy Once the water has passed through the brewer, remove it, and your coffee is ready to enjoy.![](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/coffesto-08-650x433.6ybwELw9_1Y3EXx.webp) ### #8 Cleanup Once the brewer has had a few minutes to cool, you can empty the used grounds into a compost bin or set them aside for your gardening needs. You can wash the filter with hot, soapy water or rinse thoroughly. It is also dishwasher-friendly. However, I would remove the rubber seal first as it could become damaged. ### Resources [Coffee Brewing Guide](https://ineedcoffee.com/coffee-brewing-guide/) – INeedCoffee guide to several coffee brewing methods.

# Pre-Surgery Caffeine Detox [Coffee and Health](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/coffee-health/)---by [Ryan Jacobs](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/ryan-jacobs/)![Pre-Surgery Caffeine Detox](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/pre-surgery-caffeine-detox/snowman-latte-art1.jpg) I just had some work done on my knee that required surgery. Part of the typical pre-surgery instructions is to have no food or fluids after midnight the day before surgery. This isn’t a big deal if your surgery is in the morning, but mine was at 1 p.m. By this time, I usually have at least one coffee beverage. Sure, I thought about being hungry, although I have no problem with not eating until later in the day. What I foolishly didn’t account for was that fluids include coffee. I recall in the past having major headaches as a result of caffeine detox, and as the time progressed without having my morning caffeine, I could feel the headache coming on. All in all, my headaches weren’t bad, but I should have been better prepared.![Snowman Latte Art](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/snowman-latte-art1.CAkZrwMj_Z2vv6DG.webp)_Snowman Latte Art_ In [Accelerated Detox](https://ineedcoffee.com/accelerated-caffeine-detox/), several methods are described to assist one with caffeine detox, and I think they are pretty good overall. Yet this experience got me thinking of another technique designed to avoid going into surgery with terrible caffeine withdrawal headaches. ### Forced Fading Forced coffee fading is in between cold turkey and coffee fading. In cold turkey detox, stop all consumption immediately. In the fading approach, you cut back your consumption by a half cup each day until you are to low levels. Forced fading is where you go as long as you can in the day without experiencing the terrible headaches, and then allow yourself one cup at that time. The next day, you go longer. The benefit to this approach as it relates to pre-surgery detox is that you can tailor your plan to when your surgery is. In my case, I just needed to handle making it to 1 PM, but it could have been longer or shorter. As it relates to pre-surgery detox, the goal for me was to prepare my body to be without caffeine long enough that I wouldn’t be having terrible headaches going into surgery. Coming out of it, they allowed me to have caffeinated beverages. Certainly, this technique could be used with a regular caffeine detox plan as well. Do yourself a favor and plan to be able to deal with a lack of caffeine pre-op and if need be post-op. You’ll have plenty of other things to deal with at that time. ### Resources [Accelerated Detox](https://ineedcoffee.com/accelerated-caffeine-detox/) – A strategy to detox from coffee quickly.

# Prismo Filter Upgrade For AeroPress Review and Tips [Brewing Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/brewing-coffee/)---by [Michael Allen Smith](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/michael-allen-smith/)![Prismo Filter Upgrade For AeroPress Review and Tips](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/prismo-filter-upgrade-for-aeropress-review-and-tips/prismo-for-aeropress.jpg) Fellow recently developed the Prismo, a custom AeroPress filter for making espresso shots. Is it possible to make espresso shots with the Prismo filter for the AeroPress? I have been trying to get my AeroPress to make something closer to a true espresso shot for almost two years. While I know that an AeroPress can never match a commercial espresso machine that can generate 9 bars of pressure, that hasn’t stopped me from trying. With my AeroPress, I can make concentrated coffee “shots” with characteristics similar to those found in espresso. Not every “shot” impresses me. Some beans work better than others, and some beans don’t work at all. It is a game, and I play it daily. When it comes to making “shots” with the AeroPress, I have discovered that I can get closer to replicating lungo (longer) shots made from lighter roasted single-origin coffees. The AeroPress doesn’t come close to the deep, syrupy tastes one can get from a true espresso machine for traditional espressos or ristrettos. If the Prismo could improve my shots by 10%, it would pay for itself quickly. Every shot I make at home is one fewer shot I purchase at the coffee shop. Before the review, let me show you how the Prismo works. ### Brewing Coffee with the Prismo The Prismo replaces the filter that ships with the AeroPress, so the original filter can be set aside.![Prismo Start](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/primso-start.DUP_ODa6_ZU5tE4.webp) Add the metal filter inside the insert with the Fellow logo facing up.![Add the filter](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/primso-with-insert.I-gZpcbA_29K0th.webp) Attach the Prismo to the AeroPress chamber. If you are used to making AeroPress using the Inverted (aka [Upside-Down method](https://ineedcoffee.com/upside-aeropress-coffee-brewing-tutorial/)), you do not need to do that with the Prismo. The Prismo will hold all the coffee in the brewing chamber until pressed, thus giving you a full immersion brew.![prismo attach to aeropress](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/primso-attach-filter.D9jdqbLx_Z1qeuMr.webp) Fellow recommends using 20 grams of finely ground “espresso blend or darkly roasted coffee”. They also recommend adding 50 ml of water taken to 212 F. I disagree with this recipe and will go into more detail about why later in the article. But for now, let’s get back to brewing.![stir Prismo](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/prismo-paddle.alYgpk70_Z23Jy6H.webp) It is very important to stir the coffee so that all the grounds are making contact with the hot water. Fresh coffee tends to form clumps, and when you stir, you want to break up those clumps.![Push plunger](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/prismo-brew.DGpvJbrx_Z14jmOL.webp) After one minute, push the plunger down. It will put up a bit more resistance than the standard AeroPress. And now you have your Prismo AeroPress shot. In the photo above, I used a glass. That was just for this tutorial. Normally, I use a ceramic mug and rinse it with hot water before plunging. This prevents the coffee from cooling too fast. ### Fixing the Prismo Recipe As I hinted above, I disagree with the recipe that ships with the Prismo. #### Water Temperature Boiling water is too hot for brewing coffee. If you do boil the water, let it cool a bit before you pour it into the AeroPress. How long? It depends. Use a thermometer, or a better idea is to get an electric kettle, where you can dial in the exact temperature you need. For the Prismo, I use 202 F. #### Style of Coffee I was not able to get anything close to espresso when using darker-roasted coffee. All I could get was bitter coffee that lacked that mouthfeel one gets when they have a ristretto-style espresso, which is common with darker-roasted coffee. Espresso blends that were medium-roasted fared better. Sometimes, they were fine, and sometimes, they were flat. It was hit or miss. I got the best results with medium-light roasted single-origin coffees. They were closer in flavor and texture to the longer single-origin shots being pulled at the newer coffee shops in Seattle, Portland, and San Francisco. During my tests, I had better and more consistent results with washed coffees (Colombia, Kenya) than naturally processed coffees (Peru, Oahu, Ethiopia). #### Espresso Extraction Fellow’s ratio is for dark-roasted coffee. If you are going to take my advice and go lighter, you’ll need to adjust that ratio. As I mentioned earlier, lighter coffees, when pulled as espresso, have more volume. The reason for this is that the bean is less porous than a darker-roasted coffee, so it requires more effort for the water to make contact with the bean. You could increase the steep time or increase the water volume. Starter recipes for 20 grams of coffee. - 50-55 grams of water for darker roasts - 60-65 grams of water for medium roasts - 70-75 grams of water for lighter roasts![Dime Prismo](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/dime-prismo.CszA1fO5_oVAbb.webp)_If you do not have a scale to weigh the water, the above photo shows 20 grams of coffee and 70 grams of water with a US Dime. The dime is slightly leaning._### Tips You can use the Prismo to brew regular-strength coffee. Just use a normal grind size. You’ll save money on paper filters and have rich, full-immersion coffee without needing to brew inverted. The Prismo makes a tighter connection than the standard filter. As a result, it is a little harder to lock into place and much harder to take off. I advise removing the filter just after brewing while it is still warm. If it cools, it can take tremendous effort to come off. One idea to help you grip the Prismo better is to cut a custom-sized piece of non-adhesive shelf liner, such as the one by Duck Brand. ### The Verdict I’ve never been more unsure about a coffee product. Personally, the Prismo does seem to slightly improve the flavor of my “shots” compared to the shots I make when brewing with the AeroPress regular style. However, when I brew inverted, that edge disappears. Prismo does well by holding all the coffee in the brewing chamber until the plunger is pressed. Anyone with an AeroPress that brews regular-style knows that some of the coffee exits the chamber throughout the brew. As your AeroPress ages and the seal gets looser, that process can accelerate, so some of the coffee is likely under-extracted. This is something you may not notice with brewed coffee but will with espresso-style shots. Who will benefit from the Prismo? - If you like a richer full-immersion coffee, but do not want to brew inverted (flipping the AeroPress from an upside-down position). - The Prismo also eliminates the need to buy paper filters. If you are tired of running out or ordering new paper filters, the Prismo may pay for itself. - If you have tried making espresso “shots” without the Prismo and feel like you are almost there and that you just need to improve the shot a little, the Prismo will be a must-have. - Fans of lighter-roasted single-origin espresso wanting to save some money they would have spent in the coffee shops. The Prismo won’t make true espresso like a cafe, but it might be close enough for your tastes. Who won’t benefit from the Prismo? - Someone who is already proficient and comfortable brewing with AeroPress using the inverted method. You might experience a slight improvement, but it will be much less than those that brew regular style. - If you have tried making espresso shots before with the AeroPress and feel it isn’t even close to the espresso machines, don’t expect magic from the Prismo. If a 10% improvement is not enough, save your money. - If your coffee grinder doesn’t grind finely and consistently, save your money for a better grinder. A better grinder will improve your coffee quality more than a Prismo. - People with weaker grips. See Tip #2 above. I will keep brewing with my Prismo, and if I discover any more valuable tips, I will update this article. ### Resources [The Upside Down AeroPress Coffee Brewing Tutorial](https://ineedcoffee.com/upside-aeropress-coffee-brewing-tutorial/) – How to brew AeroPress coffee using the inverted method.

# Primer on Shade Grown Coffee [Coffee Business](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/coffee-business/)---by [Ryan Jacobs](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/ryan-jacobs/)![Primer on Shade Grown Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/primer-on-shade-grown-coffee/shade-grown-coffee-plantation1.jpg) Shade Grown coffee has become synonymous with quality coffee. It refers to a method of growing coffee in a natural environment that includes shade trees and songbirds. Traditionally, coffee was always grown this way. Proponents of the product will say that growing coffee in this manner will protect the natural rainforests and that modern-day growing practices have resulted in an ecological disaster that can serve to eliminate certain animal species. ### A Canopy of Protection Traditionally, coffee was grown under a canopy of shade trees. The natural shade provided several important environmental factors that allowed the coffee to grow: - Protection from the sun. This was important because prior to the use of “technified” plants, which exist today, coffee would not grow well under direct sunlight. - A natural home for migratory birds. Not only did these birds have a home, but they just so happen to prey on some of the pests that cause damage to the coffee crop. - Nitrogen fixation in the soil. This makes the coffee more sustainable and enhances its ability to grow without the need for additional fertilizer.![shade grown coffee plantation](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/shade-grown-coffee-plantation1.zlJHEed-_1BbUx6.webp)_Shade Grown Coffee Plantation_### Technified Plants As more aggressive farming practices took hold, however, this method fell to the wayside. Farmers discovered methods of being able to grow coffee in what seemed to be a more economical way. First, “technified” coffee plants were developed which were able to grow in direct sunlight. With this new ability, the shade plants could be eliminated, leaving more room for the coffee plant. Of course, with the elimination of the shade trees, comes the elimination of natural protection from pests and the lack of nitrogen fixation in the soil. No problem: all that is needed is some fertilizer and pesticides. Yet another seeming benefit of “shadeless” coffee is that coffee grows faster this way and thus returns a higher yield. ### A Return to Days Gone By More recently, farmers have been returning to traditional methods of farming for several reasons. - Consumers are demanding organic coffee more and more. - Some have found that it is actually more economical to grow coffee using the “traditional” method. In addition to reduced cost, some of the variations of growing shade coffee allow for increased profits through crop diversification. There are, theoretically at least, fewer costs because you reduce fertilizer and pesticide usage. Not only do these chemical treatments cost money, but they also cost labor dollars to utilize. - This method is not as harsh on the land and increases the likelihood of continued crops. - Since it is perceived as more environmentally friendly (and it is) it provides a great marketing tool with which to sell to conscientious consumers. ### Is It Worth The Fuss? Farmers are finding out that growing technified coffee is not as economical as once thought and has become a burden on the growing soils. It is a short-term success in a long-term commodity. If one plans on being successful indefinitely, then one must make sure that the commodity will prosper. An obvious question that must be raised at this point is, ‘Is shade-grown coffee merely hype? Perhaps. Just how special is it to buy coffee that has not had any fancy chemicals or genetic engineering to it? Is this technologically inferior coffee worth the extra money? Will it alone prevent ecological disasters? ### A Taste Improvement As to whether or not the coffee is special without chemicals, consider that shade-grown coffee takes longer to grow than the technified variety and this results in a richer, more mellow cup. There is a definite perceived taste difference, though I will abstain from saying one is better than the other. However, the flavor profile is different. ### Supply And Demand When judging the value of shade-grown coffee, the laws of supply and demand are at work. Coffee that takes longer to grow will be more limited in supply than coffee that can be harvested faster. But there are, according to one source, fewer costs associated with growing shade-grown coffee. In addition, one can’t deny that there is a perceived health benefit to drinking coffee that has not been grown with the use of chemicals. Furthermore, some people don’t mind paying a little more for something that supports ecologically sound growing practices. ### Not All Shade-Grown Coffees Are the Same There are several methods of growing shade coffee. Not all of them are exactly natural, and not all of them are as ecologically sound as the others. Below, I will briefly review the four basic types. 1. **Rustic:** This style involves clearing out the low-level growth in a forest and replacing it with coffee. The more elevated shade trees remain to provide protection to the coffee tree. While this method allows coffee to be grown without the use of chemicals, it does eliminate other wildlife. 2. **Traditional Polyculture:** This involves choosing certain species of trees which will grow alongside the coffee. A technique that has benefited farmers is to grow other cash crops such as orange and banana trees with coffee. If this method is managed carefully, farmers can increase the yield of all crops that are being grown. 3. **Commercial Polyculture:** This system of coffee farming includes selecting a variety of shade canopy trees that protect an understory that is only coffee. 4. **Specialized Shade:** Specialized shade method utilizes only one type of shade canopy tree with which to protect the coffee. While the Commercial Polyculture and Specialized Shade seem more like planned forests than natural, they still provide habitat for wildlife. ### Finding Shade-Grown Coffee Many of the major players in the coffee industry are offering some sort of shade-grown coffee. Many of them are blends and many are straight varietals. The good news is that there is a minimal price difference between coffee grown this way and a more conventionally grown equivalent, about a dollar or two per pound. In order to make sure you are getting a true shade-grown coffee, you should check with your roaster to ensure the coffee is certified as shade-grown. Without the certification, you may not be getting the coffee you thought you were. The coffee industry has, on several occasions, become prey to shysters out to make a quick buck. Simply put, be aware. Furthermore, many coffees labeled organic are actually shade-grown themselves. A little investigation could reveal a good find. ### Conclusion Deciding whether or not shade-grown is simply the latest hype or a valid product worthy of praise is yet to be determined. At the outset, however, it certainly seems to embody the idealisms of nature itself. Ultimately, the consumers must decide if it is worth their hard-earned dollars.

# Preventing the Flu By Gargling Tea [Coffee and Health](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/coffee-health/)---by [Michael Allen Smith](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/michael-allen-smith/)![Preventing the Flu By Gargling Tea](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/preventing-the-flu-by-gargling-tea/white-peony-tea-tasting1.jpg) While reading up on the H1N1 virus, I found an interesting study measuring how tea could prevent influenza. You don’t even have to drink the tea. You can just gargle it. The study _Gargling with tea catechin extracts for the prevention of influenza infection in elderly nursing home residents,_ which came out in 2006, took 124 elderly residents and divided them into two groups. - Tea Catechin Group – Gargled 3 times a day with a tea catechin extract solution. - Control Group – Gargled 3 times a day with a solution that had no tea catechin extract. - The study took place over 3 months. - Both groups were vaccinated with an influenza vaccine. What was the result? - The Tea Catechin Group had a 1.3% infection rate. - The Control Group had a 10.0% infection rate. That is a reduction in the infection rate of 87%. I’m guessing this is encouraging news for those people sensitive to caffeine who wish to get health benefits from tea catechins. Just gargle away! According to the Wikipedia page on Catechins, other health benefits include: - Reduced risk of stroke, heart failure, cancer, and diabetes. - Skin protection from UV radiation-induced damage and tumor formation. - Antibiotic properties.![Tea Tasting - White Peony](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/white-peony-tea-tasting1.ZLlq4SMn_Z1K3wui.webp)_Tea Tasting – White Peony_ How bad could the flu season get this year? One measure is to look at places in the Southern Hemisphere that are going through winter. From _The Human Condition_ blog on Newsweek: > In Argentina, 20 to 25 percent of the population has been attacked by the flu over a three-week period. That could  easily occur in the United States, where pandemics typically attack between 25 percent and 40 percent of the population. I’m making some tea right now. Not that I fear H1N1. Any flu is to be avoided. No gargling for me though. Tea is too tasty not to consume as intended. ### Sources [Gargling with tea catechin extracts for the prevention of influenza infection in elderly nursing home residents](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16970537/) – Medical study abstract.

# Pressing Questions with Nick Cho [Coffee People](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/coffee-people/)---by [Alex Scofield](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/alex-scofield/)![Pressing Questions with Nick Cho](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/pressing-questions-with-nick-cho/nick-cho1.jpg) Nick Cho tirelessly advances the concept of coffee’s Third Wave. He chairs the United States Barista Championship, and he is the former owner of Murky Coffee in Washington, D.C., and Arlington, VA. One of Cho’s training techniques illustrates how he moved beyond Starbucks and the Second Wave — former Murky barista Jacob Grier describes how Cho gave his new employees money to buy their favorite coffee-based drink at Starbucks. Said newbies would then return to Murky, where Cho would make the same beverage. From _Murkey Remberences_: > I’d consumed thousands of coffee beverages and spent countless nights in coffee shops, but I’d never paid close attention to what was in the cups. This all changed when I watched Nick deftly pour perfectly textured milk into espresso, a lovely rosetta forming on the surface of the cappuccino as if by magic. I’d never seen or tasted anything like it. Cho closed up shop at Murky in May 2009, but last week he helped open _Chinatown Coffee Company_ in Washington. Even during Chinatown Coffee’s inaugural week, Cho took the time to field some questions on the cafe economy, espresso contenders and pretenders, and the next chapter of Cho’s life with Chinatown Coffee.**INEEDCOFFEE:** From your observation, has the economic downturn impacted business for coffeehouses?**NICK CHO:** I’m hearing through industry channels that the shops that are quality-focused have actually done just fine, if not better than ever. When people have less money to spend they either spend less money (obviously), or they are more selective about the money that they do spend. That’s what I’ve been hearing informally. Great quality coffee is still a very affordable luxury. A glass of the most famously expensive wine in the world can cost a few thousand dollars. A perfect cup of the most famously expensive coffee is still available for under $10.**INC:** Are there any ways you recommend to distinguish a real coffeehouse from a pretender, without first plunking down the money for an espresso-based beverage?**CHO:** Not really. It’s part of the state of the coffee culture right now, and hopefully, it’ll get better. I’ve seen a bunch of attempts at making a checklist of things to look for, but I can always think of a ton of exceptions that render that list irrelevant. This is the latest, and probably the best list I’ve seen: [TheShot’s Common Cues for Recognizing Good and Bad Espresso](https://web.archive.org/web/20190730172730/http://theshot.coffeeratings.com/2009/07/espresso-quality-signs/), but the same thing — I disagree with a bunch of them. Actually, come to think of it, maybe there is something. I think that the best indicator is to watch the baristas themselves. Are they working and moving with real purpose? Are their eyes focused on their grinding, dosing, and tamping, or are they waving the portafilter around as they’re talking to their co-worker about last night’s party? Do they show the signs of people who are approaching the coffee with passion and professionalism, or could they just as well be working in a highway toll-booth?**INC:** What’s your favorite coffee or espresso drink?**CHO:** I have no favorite drink. As I’ve said for years: I don’t actually _love_ coffee. I’m extremely passionate about coffee. I spend more time during the day thinking about coffee than I think about my kids. It’s because I want to show love for the people that are going to drink it… the coffee is going to become a part of their bodies after all, and that’s a huge responsibility. I’m in the people business, and coffee is my chosen tool.**INC:** Do you remember trying coffee for the first time? About how old were you?**CHO:** I was probably about 7, and it was an instant coffee. As an adult, I learned that for Koreans, the phrase “She makes a GREAT cup of coffee!” means that they mix a good proportion of freeze-dried granules, non-dairy powdered creamer, and sugar.**CH:** Tell us about Chinatown Coffee Company. Besides the location, what are some ways it will be different from Murky?**CHO:** To be clear, I don’t own Chinatown Coffee. This is a great opportunity to work with some great people in a really cool shop. Murky Coffee’s two shops were both taken over from previous businesses and being chronically underfunded, we never really got to do what we wanted to do facilities-wise. We definitely built a fan base who grew attached to the weird grunginess that was murky, but with Chinatown, I’m sort of in a new chapter in my life and career in more ways than one. Having the chance to build a shop from scratch and see it open has been a uniquely rewarding experience for me, especially because I’ve been fortunate to travel enough to become a sort of student of coffee shops around the world. What’s different? We’ve opened in a much more mature coffee culture here in D.C. than when I started the murky shops back in 2002 and 2004. We can be even more quality-focused than before, and the response from our customers this first week has been phenomenal. Oh, and also the air-conditioning actually works and works well!**INC:** The $64,000 question: Will _triple espresso on the rocks_ be on the menu at Chinatown Coffee Company?**CHO:** How self-absorbedly snarky will your resulting blog post be if you order it and you’re denied? 😉![coffee and newspaper](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/coffee-newspaper-2.Yg98ArgK_E3JPl.webp) ### Sources [Murky remembrances](https://web.archive.org/web/20160623192338/http://www.jacobgrier.com/blog/archives/2105.html) – by Jacob Grier [Espresso, Extra Bitter](https://web.archive.org/web/20240806173228/https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/07/16/AR2008071602018.html) – By Joe Heim – Washington Post Staff Writer July 17, 2008 Published on August 3, 2009--- #### Alex Scofield Alex Scofield is a freelance writer who lives in Cape Cod, Mass.

# Preparing Traditional Turkish Coffee [Brewing Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/brewing-coffee/)---by [Eyal Rosen](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/eyal-rosen/)![Preparing Traditional Turkish Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/preparing-a-traditional-turkish-coffee/preaparing-a-traditional-turkish-coffee.jpg) During my recent travel to Istanbul, I researched tens of coffeehouses and found the perfect cup in the centuries-old Ali Pasha coffee house. The Ottomans invented Kahve, Turkish coffee hundreds of years ago. The exceptional taste, body, aroma, preparation, and presentation associated with Turkish coffee lend it an exclusive identity that is infused with time-honored tradition. Made with high-quality Arabica beans from Central America and Brazil, the coffee is first blended, then roasted to a medium-light level, and finally ground into an extra-fine grind. ### Turkish coffee preparation (one cup): Pour water into a small Turkish coffee cup called a fincan (about 1.7oz) and dispense it into a small brass cezve coffee pot.![Pour water into cup](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/traditional-turkish-11.DGWecZ9t_ZHPd3x.webp)_Pour Water into a Turkish Coffee Cup_ Add two teaspoons of Turkish coffee. The grinds should be much finer than those of espresso so that they will ultimately sink to the bottom.![Add Turkish Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/traditional-turkish-2.BHXYtg4W_Zei6C1.webp)_Add Turkish Coffee_ Add up to 2 teaspoons of sugar (If desired).![Add sugar](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/traditional-turkish-3.Bmv95AjL_13situ.webp)_Add sugar_ Tip: while making the Turkish coffee, keep the fincan filled with hot water so that it keeps hot. Empty the cup just prior to pouring in the coffee. On a small flame, stir for about one minute. Then, without stirring, let the coffee come to a boil. This should take 3-4 minutes.![Let coffee boil](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/traditional-turkish-4.afZ1voSr_Z70MHs.webp)_Let coffee boil_ Pour the coffee into the fincan in one swift movement so that all the foam is smoothly transferred.![Pour the coffee into the fincan](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/traditional-turkish-5.BfXEt4MI_TIFTn.webp)_Pour the coffee into the fincan_ Serve with a small cup of fresh water (as traditionally done in Turkey).![Serve Turkish Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/traditional-turkish-6.5V_ecjNa_Z1zNhiR.webp)_Serve Turkish Coffee_ Take a small sip of water to clear the palate and then, once the coffee grinds have sunk to the bottom, little by little, drink the coffee. Don’t drink the grinds at the bottom. These may be used to tell your future. When you have finished your coffee, turn the cup over.

# Pulling the Perfect Shot of Espresso [Espresso](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/espresso/)---by [Fred Neve](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/fred-neve/)![Pulling the Perfect Shot of Espresso](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/pulling-the-perfect-shot-of-espresso/level-espresso.jpg) Not all espresso makers are the same, so you need to know what type of machine you have. Do you have a machine where you pour fresh water on top and then screw the lid down? Then, chances are that you will have a steam-driven machine. If your machine has a huge reservoir and makes all sorts of noises when you push a series of buttons that look like some kind of computer panel, you have a pump-driven machine.![espresso shot](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/espresso-shot1.DrJRtel-_20cB9t.webp)_Espresso Shot_### The Grind Coffee should be ground for your type of espresso machine. Grinding for pump-driven machines is slightly longer than for steam-driven machines; the coffee must be fine ground because steam-driven machines don’t have as much “oomph” to push water through. The grind for pump-driven model machines should be shorter and, therefore, more coarse. Other factors that make a difference are heat, humidity, and where your coffee is stored. Now, I’m not trying to bore you, but these items can be vital if you are trying to achieve consistently perfect espresso shots. ### Pulling The Shot Once you know what machine you have and the coffee is ground, it is time to pull shots. 1. The actual measure should be a tablespoon of espresso ground coffee for every 1 ounce of liquid. For you techies, that’s 7 grams per ounce. 2. Put the ground coffee in your portafilter. 3. Carefully tamp the ground coffee, and then wipe any excess grounds from the rim of the filter. 4. Place your filter in the machine’s group and place the shot glass or glasses underneath.![level espresso](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/level-espresso.CxCM87t2_Z1LsodL.webp)_Level Espresso_ The Trick: Get an inexpensive timer or use your stopwatch (the one you had to have for your New Year’s Day resolution that you will train with) and learn to “time” a shot. A good espresso machine should yield an ounce of liquid between 18 and 23 seconds. You can get away with a 17-second “sweet” shot, but NEVER exceed 23 seconds. The longer, the more bitter; the shorter, the less flavor you taste. If your shots pull too quickly, your grind is too coarse. If the shot is too slow, then the grind was too fine. ### Tips For Consistency How do you get consistent shots? - Buy enough coffee for only one week. This may sound silly, but coffee starts to “air” out after seven days. So, as time goes by, the quality and flavor diminish. - Keep the coffee in a sealed container. Store in a cool, dry place. Heat and humidity negatively affect coffee! - Try to grind the coffee yourself. The best thing to do is to grind the coffee right before you pull the shot and only grind enough coffee for an ounce or two. This will allow you to make any necessary adjustments to the grind for future shots. Grinding the coffee at home ensures that your coffee has that “just ground” flavor you would experience at a coffee house. ### A Work Of Art Just how is it supposed to look and taste? The perfect shot has a sweet yet intense flavor, and it should have a beautiful caramel look at the top. A shot has three parts: the crema, the body, and the heart. The crema, the foamy part of the shot, should be sweet. The visual clues of the other two parts will help you understand how the shot will taste. As you pull the shot, notice how the layers separate as the liquid gets to the “ounce” mark on the glass. It looks as if an artist was at work! And you are!!

So, I have fun and the coffee drinks are on the house. (Damn good deal for me..huh?!!) I love sharing coffee or espresso with friends across the world. I was in the Navy for 12 years and visited 47 countries. I’ve tried just about every type of coffee imaginable!

# Rancilio Silvia Espresso Machine Tips [Espresso](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/espresso/)---by [Ryan Jacobs](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/ryan-jacobs/)![Rancilio Silvia Espresso Machine Tips](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/rancilio-silvia-espresso-machine-tips/2833805604_49edb10eb8_z.jpg) Using the Rancilio Silvia Espresso machine can be a bit intimidating if you have never used an espresso machine at all or even if you have previously used a machine that controlled a lot of the variables for you. The machine to a large degree assumes you know what you are doing. If you don’t, it can’t compensate for your mistakes. Below are some tips I have learned from others and from personal experience. ### Heating the Machine It takes a bit of time for the machine to come up to temperature. When you turn the machine on, a light will turn on indicating that it is heating and once the light goes away you are left with the impression that the machine is up to temperature. It isn’t quite the case. If you do nothing else, the machine will be at a good temperature in about 20 minutes — but I really don’t like waiting. There are two general ways to improve this that I am aware of: 1. **Leave the machine on all the time:** This method is pretty much as straightforward as it sounds, but doing this can cause the gaskets in your machine to dry out and crack prematurely. That said, my understanding is that if you choose this method and leave the portafilter in the group, it will help prevent the drying condition immensely. 2. **Force more heating cycles:** After initially turning the machine on, the light turns on, indicating the start of a heating cycle. Once it turns off, brew an empty shot through the portafilter. Typically, at the end of this, the light will kick on again for another cycle. This is a good time to dose and tamp our espresso and insert it into the portafilter. Now, put a water pitcher under the steam wand, turn on the hot water, and open the valve. Again, let this happen until the light turns on. At this point, you can brew your first shot. Some people swear by more cycles, but I find this to work quite well. As a point of clarification, you only need to cycle the machine upon first turning it on. Subsequent shots should be fine at this point.![rancilio silvia espresso machine](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/rancilio-silvia-espresso-machine1.7jOig5pe_1bH3St.webp)_Rancilio Silvia Espresso Machine_### Grinding the Espresso The Silvia is a fairly advanced home espresso machine and as such is very unforgiving to poor grind and tamping. You’ll have to step your game up a notch. I found that my Starbucks Barista burr grinder just wasn’t adequate anymore, but I did find out it could be [recalibrated with a little work](https://ineedcoffee.com/hacking-the-starbucks-barista-grinder/). Certainly, you will want a capable burr grinder — there are many to choose from with varying degrees of settings. What is important is to make sure you have fine enough settings for espresso. Another consideration here is if you can grind directly into the portafilter. That feature will help on the tamping side a bit. ### Tamping the Espresso You need a good tamper. I really am fond of the heavy stainless steel tampers sized perfectly for the Silvia. Some technique helps also. I found the following steps to really help my tamps. Dose as directly into the portafilter as possible. If you can’t grind directly into your portafilter, use your grind collection basket to dose from. The idea here is to prevent inconsistencies in the puck that might happen from scooping or any other activity that sort of packs the grind prematurely (i.e. before it is in the portafilter).![add coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/2832964217_84a8175a64_z.Df3t2BSx_Z1WiA8t.webp) Overflow the portafilter just slightly using this method and then do a curved finger sweep to lightly spread the grounds. Again, the emphasis on the light sweep is to prevent premature packing of the espresso. This step also allows you to rid the portafilter of excess grounds.![continue dosing espresso](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/2832965025_398d830bf6_z.DFXbedU2_23NaJr.webp)![level espresso](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/2832965651_4c6f4f4061_z.DvCbZTlW_LWaQp.webp) Now, take your heavy tamper and allow the weight to naturally settle into the portafilter which does a pre-pack.![pre-pack espresso](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/2833805604_49edb10eb8_z.DsIEM3uH_1dy1tK.webp)![almost level tamp](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/2833807078_fd12cc8ce5_z.B60P4mSi_j4eMz.webp) To prepare for the final tamp, we will be applying a lot of pressure downward. I like to use the edge of a counter and allow the rounded bottom of the portafilter to rest on the edge. This is more stable and less damaging to the counter than pressing down on the portafilter spouts.![prepare for final tamp](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/2832968467_d69aff71b1_z.B2XWI4Me_2tI7uR.webp) Now, apply firm, even pressure down into the portafilter and release. The general recommendation is 30 lbs. of force, and the general recommendation for learning what that feels like is to push your tamper onto a bathroom scale until it registers 30 lbs. You should see a very smooth and level puck. You are now ready to insert this into the group and begin brewing.![tamp espresso](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/2832968857_41df810a11_z.ClUq3Jg1_1veyMk.webp) ### Brewing After placing the portafilter in the group, lock it into place such that the two spouts line up square to the machine.![prepare for pull](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/2832969423_72d93011f3_z.vaRqWRmS_Z26QYfN.webp) Press the brew button and time your shot.

Between shots, I like to use a group cleaning brush to loosen any stray grinds in the portafilter prior to rinsing under hot water.![clean portafilter](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/2833802494_a7db035524_z.0miQUIxx_Z1DT3O2.webp) ### Resources [A Rancilio Silvia Espresso Machine Tutorial For the Caffeine-Inclined](https://ineedcoffee.com/a-rancilio-silvia-espresso-machine-tutorial-for-the-caffeine-inclined/) – Step-by-step tutorial on using the Rancilio Silvia Espresso Machine.

# The Problem with Blonde Roasts [Roasting Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/roasting-coffee/)---by [Len Brault](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/len-brault/)![The Problem with Blonde Roasts](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/problem-blonde-roasts/problem-with-blonde-roasts.jpg) Blonde roasts are one of the fashionable trends in coffee, and while it seems that many consumers do have an appetite for these, we see a lot of confusion in print and media about this “lighter than Light” roast level. We also have concerns about the high levels of acidity seen in extra-light roasts and wonder, “Are they even healthy?” In the past, this level of roast has often been called Cinnamon Roast, but that term has fallen out of favor because too many consumers confuse the word Cinnamon with a flavoring and not just a color. While Starbucks® promotes the term Blonde Roast, they define it in their advertising as not related to color so much as “light-bodied and flavorful – our easiest-drinking coffee” and “a true light roast”, yet when we pour the beans onto any number of standard roast charts, they match more to a Medium Roast level. And we see many roasters offering what we would call a true Blonde, yet they either do not provide a term for that roast level or seem to make up their own. So, for the sake of defining a roast genre here and possibly reducing confusion in the print media, we are defining Blonde as beans roasted to the very light level shown in the opening picture and defined in roasting terms later in this article. This level of roast results in higher acidity and a very different taste profile from other roasts because certain physical changes have not taken place in the beans, which would take place further along in the roast time for darker roasts. ### What is the Attraction of Blonde Roasts? Human beings vary greatly in the makeup of their tasting apparatus. Just as some people are “color-blind”, and some people are “tone-deaf”, we find that people have a wide spectrum of taste preferences and sensitivity levels. Some like hot and spicy food, while some recoil from it, for instance. And it seems that people prefer a widely different level of acidity. Blond roasts will always be more acidic than darker roasts of the same coffee simply because heat breaks down the acidity more as it roasts longer and hotter. The high acidity of Blonde Roast is generally perceived as a lemony, citrusy, or sour taste, and seems to be craved by some people. Darker roasts experience more of the “Maillard reaction”, which primarily refers to the caramelization of sugar and reactions with the beans’ amino acids that produce buttery, caramel tones, while the citrusy notes are being reduced. Why would some people crave a citrusy character in coffee that others may find unappealing?![Main-image-Blondes](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/Main-image-Blondes.EDTE9hnz_ZGkJBt.webp) ### The “Tongue Map” and Why People Taste Differently Research shows that the historical “Tongue Map” first presented and popularized by German scientist David P Hänig in a 1901 paper titled Zur Psychophysik des Geschmackssinnes is not really accurate, even though we see these diagrams in Physiology classrooms even today. The Tongue Map defined regions of the tongue that are highly specialized in how they respond to essential components of taste such as sweetness, sourness, bitterness, etc. More modern research shows that although different parts of our taste apparatus seem more responsive than others to particular taste elements, if we block a region, its “assigned” sensitivity will still be perceived by other parts of the sensory apparatus, which includes not just the tongue but the nose and throat. We also know that some of the population are what is called “supertasters”, with 3-4 times more sensitivity than “non-tasters”, the 25% of the population with very low taste sensitivity.[1] Not only does our strength of taste perception vary tremendously, but some people are super-sensitive to some taste elements and not to others. Let’s also add in the fact that people who favor the front palate tasting apparatus (includes most of the nasal aroma detection) are approximately half of the population versus people who favor the anterior sensory apparatus (including the sensors on the back of the tongue and throat that are more closely associated with taste recall in the insular cortex of the brain).[2] Front-palate people will tend to prefer coffee strains like Arabica Typica, Ethiopians, etc., that are high in aroma and acidity, whereas back-palate people will prefer strains like Robusta, Catimor, or Arabicas such as Bourbon or Caturra, which are higher in body and generally lower in acidity. We (and probably you) have friends and acquaintances who love to suck on lemons and other sour foods, while others aggressively reject food with any acidity or sourness in it. It would appear to be a normal distribution of diversity in terms of not only sensitivity level but also preference based on experience (their past diet and culinary heritage). Considering this landscape of human deviation, how can any coffee pundit even attempt to declare that any one type of coffee or roast is The Best, or is right for everybody, and expect us all to learn to love it even though we may not like it at all? That’s the fundamental concept of a uni-dimensional approach to what makes coffee “good” or “right”. In over 30,000 blind taste tests we have performed among the general public, we have seen that people’s taste preferences in coffee run all the way across the board in every regard, including roast level, species of coffee, and flavor attributes. ### The Roast Chart We look at roast charts and use assign names to colors of roasts, but oftentimes we can understand more how a roast will taste when we define them by roast time and what is taking place in the beans. Note on the roast chart that we created for our own use, and is reproduced here, we have simplified what is often a complex listing of 9 or more levels to the ones most easily understood in coffee jargon by consumers and hobby roasters. We personally dispensed with distinctions like “Full City ++” as being ridiculous in practical use because no two coffee roasters ever assign the exact same color or temperature to designations like that, so it tends to be meaningful only when comparing offerings from the same roaster. So here we show six stages from Light to French Roast. Note that there is no “Blonde” or “Italian” or “Spanish” Roast on our chart. We chose to show roasts from Light to French Roast because these are the ones we think the largest percentage of the population can perceive and appreciate best, and also due to safety and health concerns. Beyond French are roasts that are hazardous to the roaster (they particularly present a serious danger of fire when home roasting), but also, French Roast is the point at which you begin to burn the sugars and oils in the beans, rendering them (in our opinion) unhealthy as a food… creating excess amounts of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and acrylamide, etc.![Roasting-Card](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/Roasting_Card_image.DSUG2bPg_ZcRjkb.webp) The AMA and most health organizations have come around after years of persecution of coffee to believe that the net result of consuming up to 4 or 5 cups of coffee a day is a lot more positive than negative, protecting against many forms of cancer and other illnesses, but beyond a certain dark roast level, the balance tips the other way. Basically, burnt food is not good for you! ### Are Blonde Roasts Also Outside of the “Healthy Range”? Let’s talk about what happens on the other end of the roast scale. Notwithstanding taste and flavor profiles and preferences, is Blonde Roast healthy? In referring to the scale we show here (and simplifying greatly), Light Roast is generally the point at which a phenomenon called “First Crack” is fully achieved on the beans… and if we had Blonde on this chart, it would be defined as air roaster temperature of ~415°F and the color achieved before First Crack., or shortly after the beginning of First Crack. The first crack is basically similar to popcorn when it pops – the moisture inside the beans turns to steam and expands suddenly and forcefully, creating a strong “popping” sound. If you do not turn the heat off after First Crack you pass through various stages prior to reaching Second Crack, which is when the beans pop again. At Second Crack, the sound is much quieter, generally referred to as a crackling sound, that is more like pouring milk on puffed crispy rice cereal. Second Crack may come fairly close on the heels of First Crack or it may take several minutes, depending on the beans. The stages shown on our chart as City, Medium, and Full City occur between First and Second Crack. Generally, as Second Crack starts, you leave Full City territory and enter Dark Roast territory. If you wait until the end of Second Crack, you generally have a Dark Roast. French Roast is usually achieved by going anywhere from 30 seconds or so beyond Second Crack until there is a point at which smoke from the roaster increases exponentially. If you quit 10-20 seconds after you see this rise in smoke, you will be in the neighborhood of French Roast. If you wait too long you will quickly pass into Italian/Spanish Roast territory, which basically translates into “burnt coffee beans”, then quickly enter the danger zone known as “Conflagration Roast”, at which point the beans burst into flame and the fire department learns that there is another Newbie Roaster in the neighborhood._(By the way, there is no such designation as “Conflagration Roast”; this is a joking term to define the range in which a fire is more likely to break out in your roaster.)_ So if the Blonde or Cinnamon Roast level is basically what you have before you enter or finish First Crack, what is happening inside the beans? They do not pop, which makes the beans, as a food, significantly different in taste and biological composition from beans that have been through First Crack. Some of the characteristics: 1. The beans are very hard. They couldn’t be used in chocolate-covered bean confections and they may even wear down a small grinder over time due to their hardness. The cracking of the bean and the length of time exposed to heat in the roaster lowers the density of the bean, but less expansion and drying occurs in Blonde Roast. 2. Many of the flavor compounds we traditionally associate with the taste of coffee are not converted from sugars to those buttery or caramel tones. Many of the aromatics that give the coffee a fruity and sweet note do not burn off at this roast level, so there may be a plethora of these tones, which some people really enjoy. It is said that there are over 800 flavor components in coffee, which are continually being expressed at different stages of aging, roasting, time resting after brewing, etc.[3] It is a common conceit to say that Blonde Roast showcases the “real” flavor or nature of the bean… but all roast levels showcase a complex process affected by the quality of the bean and what it has extracted from the soil and converted from sunlight. 3. The acidity of the beans is not reduced anywhere near as much as with darker roasts. And acidity of coffee is a health issue for many people who will suffer medical symptoms if they consume liquids with high acidity like tomato juice… or Blonde-Roast coffee. ### How Acidic is a Blonde Roast? A quick overview of the acid-base scale shows us numbers with a range of 0-14, with base or alkalinity at the higher numbers and acidity at the lower numbers, and the scale is logarithmic, meaning that each whole digit is a multiple of 10 of the one below it in terms of acid ions. This means that a level of 4.0 has 10 times as many acid ions as a level of 5.0. Readings from cups of brewed coffee showing a Blonde Roast purchased from a local roaster, our own Medium Roast, and our own Dark Roast, in that order:_(Readings were taken using a simple, inexpensive lab PH meter, in this case, a Milwaukee Instruments ph600 unit … consider getting one if you are at all interested in the acidity of the coffee – and other liquids – you consume. You will get accurate readings if you start each session by calibrating to a known liquid-like distilled water first.)_![Blondes-acid-cup](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/Blondes-acid-cup.C15nAYsp_ZR8GBN.webp)_4.5 – Blonde roast coffee_![Blondes-medium-roast](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/Blondes-medium-roast.DQxqjMjx_ZM5sKa.webp)_5.4 – Medium roast coffee_![Blondes-dark-roast](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/Blondes-dark-roast.DVMkTv1g_1LuqSx.webp)_5.9 – Dark roasted coffee_ For easily understood reference, here are a few acid/base numbers for foods we recognize:**9.0:** Tap water adjusted for high alkalinity to avoid leaching of lead and other metals from the pipes**8.0:** Seawater**7.0:** A common “neutral” reference point for distilled water, etc., often used to calibrate the PH sensors**6.3:** Naturally occurring water as found in mountain streams and many springs (not hot springs or springs coming from limestone)**5.9:** A common reading for ripe-bean brewed Dark Roast coffee (see picture 3 above)**5.4:** A common reading for ripe-bean brewed Medium Roast coffee (see picture 2 above)**4.7 – 4.9:** A common reading for brewed coffee from commercial coffee brands that use a significant percentage of unripe coffee beans (we will not name names).**4.4 – 4.6:** A common reading for ripe-bean brewed Blonde Roasts (see picture 1 above)**4.4:** Tomato juice**3.0:** Vinegar (ranges from 2.0 to 3.5 depending on type and concentration)**1.0:** Battery acid The level at which a food or drink can start to have adverse effects on stomach acid is anywhere under the 5.0 range. Our bodies expect food to be in a certain acid range, and we adjust our stomach acid levels to compensate for and produce the right acidity during digestion. When foods have an acidity level below 5,0, many individuals will experience stress from being unable to keep the acid level of the stomach in a good balance for health. Side effects include acid stomach, stomach ache, cramps, heart palpitations (not related to burnt elements), esophageal spasms, and other symptoms of GERD. One great indicator of coffee acidity: Soy milk or soy creamer. Soy milk curdles easily in most coffee, but soy creamer is more stable. When you add soy creamer to coffees that are above the 4.8 range, the soy will not curdle. When you add soy creamer to coffee below that PH, you get this:![Blondes-curdling](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/Blondes-curdling.BP0LzT6S_ZSAyCO.webp)_Soy creamer added to an acidic coffee._ Unfortunately, acidity at this level has to generally be considered not very healthy for people, especially if consumed on an empty stomach. Some Blond Roasts have 10,000 more acid ions per ounce than PH-adjusted tap water, and are closer in acidity to vinegar than they are to most Dark Roast coffees! ### The Effects of Brew Temperature and Extraction on Acidity Despite a lot of common myths about extraction ratios, brewing temperatures, and brewing methods, we found acidity concentrations to remain very consistent in the tests we performed for this article. Tests were done using a French Press, a Vietnamese drip brewer, a standard drip brewer, an espresso machine at the highest temperature and pressure, and a cold brew performed at several variations in concentration from 1:3 coffee to water to 1:4 coffee to water. Brew temperatures ranged from 70° (for the “cold brew”) to 205°F for the espresso. The variance in all cases was under .2 on the meter for all tests. We found the commonly held belief that cold brew is less acidic to be largely inaccurate… although there was a .1 – .2 drop in acidity for the cold brew, we can’t really call that significant. Our conclusion: The main variables for acidity are the coffee variety and the roast level. The roast level could change the acidity by 3000%, whereas other variables were under 20%. ### Some Benefits of Blonde Roasts Recent research has pointed out the awesome anti-oxidation benefits of coffee in general, and also something that was not generally known: The “silverskin” of the coffee bean has health properties similar in nature to ascorbic acid (Vitamin C) and up to 400 times the efficacy of Vitamin C pound-for-pound! Researchers and developers are looking at ways to harness the anti-oxidation and health benefits of coffee silverskin as a food supplement for populations suffering from lack of naturally occurring Vitamin C or other anti-oxidants. The great thing about this substance is that it is not destroyed by the heat of brewing, even though it is reduced. Even discarded coffee grounds contain a large number of antioxidants.[4] The lower the roast level, the higher the amount of many of the beneficial substances of coffee. However, there is a limit. Green, unroasted coffee beans actually have no antioxidant effect. The beans need to be heated to 170° or more to create the chemical change that activates these antioxidants. Also, green beans have many substances that are not healthy, and can even cause nausea and other strong effects. These substances are converted to other molecular structures that are not harmful when coffee is heated, which is why it is generally recognized that green bean extract should not be made from uncooked beans, but rather from beans boiled for at least 12 minutes. Blonde Roast coffee has significantly more antioxidant potential than darker roasts, so there is a health benefit there. ### Summary Whether or not you enjoy the taste of Blonde Roast coffee, you should be aware of the high acidity of Blonde Roasts and adjust your consumption to fit your own sensitivities to acid. Fully ripe high-quality beans produce less acidic brews (a subsequent comparison Blonde Roast of our own Nicaragua Matagalpa Catimor tested at 4.8, about 25% less acidic than the original test Blonde). Since higher temperature roasts reduce the amount and benefit of many of the substances that make coffee great for your health and disease resistance, Blonde Roasts carry more benefits in this regard. The acidity of Blonde Roasts may get negative reviews from many people, who will perceive them as “sour” or acidic-tasting. However, can there be an objective “right” or “wrong” for coffee, considering the tremendous diversity of the population’s tasting physiology? In the end, aside from the negative of high acidity, whether Blondes have more fun dancing on your tongue versus the Brunette Roasts is largely a matter of personal palate preferences. Our research in performing over 30,000 blind taste tests in public settings has led us to believe that fewer than 20% of the population will prefer the taste of a coffee that is outside the “Light” to “French Roast” range, but for those who do, _vive la différence._### References 1.

# Red Espresso is Espresso Style Rooibos [Tea](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/tea/)---by [Michael Allen Smith](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/michael-allen-smith/)![Red Espresso is Espresso Style Rooibos](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/red-espresso-is-espresso-style-rooibos/red-espresso-rooibos.jpg) I recently received something interesting to review. It is a product called _Red Espresso_. _Red Espresso_ is a finely ground rooibos, which can be used to make a concentrated “espresso.” Before I begin the review, let us bring everyone up on rooibos. Rooibos is not a coffee—nor, technically, is it a tea, although it is sometimes known as “bush tea” or “red tea” or “redbush tea.” Tea comes from the camellia sinensis plant, while Rooibos comes from the legume family. It originates in South Africa, and it has no caffeine and an antioxidant level that far exceeds that of tea or coffee.![fill portafilter with red roobios](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/red-espreso-roobios-portafilter.CmeqdhuI_suaUp.webp)_Prepare the Red Espresso Shot_ If you’ve never had rooibos before, it has a rich, sweet taste similar to tea or even a sports drink. It tastes good, hot and cold. Although I am not a parent, I could see serving cold-brewed rooibos to kids instead of the sugar-based drinks typically handed to children. Back to _Red Espresso_. _Red Espresso_ is a finely ground version of pure rooibos, which makes it possible to pull espresso shots. As a fan of rooibos and an espresso fanatic, I was excited to try this product. It delivered. I pulled several shots of espresso and experimented with dosage and tamping. Here is what I learned. 1. Only tamp enough to level out the shot. You are not packing it like regular espresso. 2. Because you aren’t packing the shot, don’t overfill. It just needs to be level._Red Espresso_ delivered a rich, full, espresso-like taste with rooibos. I made shots for several rooibos fans, most of whom were not coffee drinkers, and they all enjoyed the rich flavor. It was a hit.![red espresso - rooibos tea](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/red-espresso-roobios.BEewqRdB_Z1hbD32.webp)_Red Espresso Ground Rooibos Tea_ Before completing my tests, I decided to pull espresso shots of regular rooibos tea that had not been ground as fine as _Red Espresso_. It was a mess and failed to yield the same rich flavor. Stick with _Red Espresso_. I did not experiment with grinding my rooibos. There is no way I’m putting rooibos in my Rocky grinder.![red espresso vs regular rooibos](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/roobios-vs-red-espresso.DG-okvmR_ZTD3er.webp)_Red Espresso vs Regular Rooibos_ I also experimented with making lattes and latte art using Red Espresso.

# Ready To Drink (RTD) Espresso and Iced Coffee [Coffee Business](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/coffee-business/)---by [Anthony Ramirez](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/anthony-ramirez/)![Ready To Drink (RTD) Espresso and Iced Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/ready-to-drink-rtd-espresso-and-iced-coffee/birdy-ice-coffee1.jpg) Imagine, a flawless shot of espresso; pulled for what will become lusciousness of the blended kind. What do you call a perfect marriage of ice, chilled milk, orange-flavored syrup, and espresso? Introducing the “Borgia Latte”. Born of the mother of invention and the father of Wall Street marketing, sister of ingenuity and brother of practicality; an inauspicious occasion to be sure, yet as significant as the very birth of the blues. The espresso purists of any age would like to see espresso stay espresso; it’s as the Beatles said: Let it be. Even the espresso purist admits the demand for specialty coffee has grown to include espresso-based drinks. Today the popular market demand dictates the addition of a blender, milk, ice, and a wide cornucopia of flavorings. We all know that ice has been around since the dawn of time and coffee has been consumed in one form or another for thousands of years. Who’s to say that the Capuchin monks didn’t take imported chunks of ice from the frozen places near their cloisters and add shavings or chunks of mountain spring ice to their brewed coffee and milk for refreshment after vespers.![birdy ice coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/birdy-ice-coffee1.Ba-1b1nb_29Oaiq.webp)_Birdy Ice Coffee is an RTD espresso drink sold in Thailand._ The reality is that the courtship of specialty coffee, with iced milk and exotic flavors, first developed decades ago when the visionary coffee men of yesteryear began thinking outside of the hot cup. Their legacies are with us today in the chilled coffee realm of the new class of drinks known in the specialty coffee industry as RTD (Ready To Drink) iced tea, coffee, or espresso beverages. According to Matt Brandenburger, Vice President of Sales at Torani Syrups, whose grandfather once worked for General Mills, decades ago granddad “Brandy” suggested to his bosses that they market a chilled coffee drink, something like a latte but flavored with fruit. As with Marconi and his wireless, they all laughed and suggested he put his time to better use further developing instant coffee uses. Along the way, he invented the Borgia Latte! In addition to unique varieties of iced teas or chilled coffee/espresso beverages, another class of RTD beverages are the fortified teas and citrus coolers that boost energy while providing vitamins, and performance-enhancing herbs, and revitalizing neutraceuticals to power up RTD consumers like never before. ### Trends The cause for this new wave of RTD products in terms of variety and popularity has been a nearly decade-long growth of U.S. economic prosperity that affords American consumers to pay the higher prices for premium beverages they perceive to be of deserved bonus value or inherent luxury. Even fine dining establishments have found their customers are expecting an equally memorable cup of coffee to conclude a memorable dining experience. In the words of Bruce Mullins, Vice President of Coffee Bean International, “…specialty coffee consumers tend to have unspoken higher expectations for products and services than other people.” In the Specialty coffee marketplace, the largest age group with many of those higher expectations is the 18-24 age group. This group of coffee consumers rose 25% in 2000 from 23% in 1999. These young adults tend toward the larger 9.0-ounce cup sizes and tend toward out-of-home consumption so that even 7-Elevens carry a Cappuccino Frappe. In the early 1990s, the added burden with RTD beverages was the challenge of marketing a beverage to a public that previously didn’t perceive iced coffee as a traditionally refreshing beverage. When it comes to specialty coffee knowledge the American consumer has become savvy and their tastes more sophisticated. Not only have they been given more Specialty coffee choices than ten years ago, but the proliferating larger corporate coffeehouses and smaller independent coffee retailers both have also helped to further educate and illuminate the tastes of the coffee consumer. More so than ever before Americans are in a position to demand quality specialty coffee beverages from the marketplace.![rtd espresso seattle latte](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/rtd-espresso-seattle-latte.BdxqYLxR_2iPW3I.webp)_This RTD drink which sports the Seattle name was also sold in Thailand._ The real key to RTD popularity has been the successful spin in the marketing of RTD Frappe drinks and other RTD chilled coffee beverages. These RTD have been promoted as something other than simply sweetened cold coffee/espresso with milk. Consumers substitute these beverages as stand-alone drinks or as snack beverages, thusly creating a new category unto itself. Historically, the American RTD coffee market category has been limited because of its higher price point and consumer perception as a non-refreshment beverage. In revving up this product the US market has worked out the marketing of RTD to the active and affluent lifestyles; creating new consumers in a brand new market niche, all due to the impacting popularity of RTD coffees and teas. In the U.S., and especially abroad in the U.K. where there’s less of the sunshine and leisure lifestyle to help sell cold and iced blended beverages, retailers are relying more on their staff to be sales, promotions, and marketing experts when it comes to their iced espresso/tea/frappe business. According to Jeffrey O’Brian, UK Distributor for Tazo Teas, Stash, and Arizona Beverages, the marketing of RTD beverages at the retail level has evolved to include the customer in promotions such as signature blended drinks, specialty iced teas, thereby creating an event and a sense of adventure with the added bonus of refreshment of iced-over hot. Jeffrey admits that the UK customers have cottoned to their iced coffee, but they still need education about iced espresso and lattes. The UK businessmen, like their US counterparts, have come to embrace the iced espresso drink trend as a great source of added revenue in their menus. Jeffrey says, “Trends (like iced coffee beverages) are either led by the market or led by the consumer.” For iced and blended RTD it appears that both consumers and retailers synergize the industry, as new drinks are introduced and consumer tastes broaden to include iced coffee. Since coffee is the number one drink on this planet, it’s no surprise that US consumption has reached a new all-time record of 79% of the American population. This means that more than 160 million coffee drinkers have consumed coffee with a total retail value of 18.5 billion, according to the National Coffee Association. The 1997 RTD Tea & Coffee in the U.S. report from the Beverage Marketing Corporation, states that ready-to-drink consumption volume has jumped forward 147.3 percent to a growth of 41.2 million gallons over the previous year. In the years ahead look for more major food and beverage companies to get behind the RTD iced coffee and tea beverage trend and submit more variety of drinks for the thirsty consumer. ### Conclusion The average coffee drinker now consumes an average of 3.1 cups of coffee per day. Shouldn’t one of these cups be an Iced Latte or a blended Raspberry Mocha? It’s obvious that the Ready to Drink Iced Coffee / Tea trend is here to stay, with enough variety to satisfy every taste. The key for retailers will be to create interest and generate and innovate drinks that meet the coffee consumer’s demanding tastes and lifestyles. Meanwhile, I’ll order another Iced Vanilla Latte.

What’s not to love? It’s fun to brew and the coffee is as good as brewed coffee can be, without the sediment you get with a press pot. I also love to buy old vac pots, but as pretty as they are, if the rubber gasket is old and hard, they are just dust-catchers on the shelf because they don’t create a seal. Without the seal, air escapes around the gasket and you don’t get the vacuum necessary to pull the coffee back into the lower decanter. I broke an upper bowl on one that was difficult to remove after brewing.

Go to the auto parts store and get a can of transmission stop leak. This stuff works on the seals and gaskets in the transmission just as it works on your vac pot gasket. Take the gasket off the upper bowl of the vac pot and soak it in the stop leak for 2 or 3 days. I have had good results on one of my gaskets, and I am now soaking the others. I don’t know if it will work on cracked gaskets. It won’t make them as new but will soften the old rubber just enough to make the seal. It may not work on all, but for about $4, it’s worth the try. The stuff stinks, so don’t put it in the kitchen. It’s hard to wash off, but the rubber doesn’t come in contact with the coffee, so it’s safe._This article originally appeared in Badgett’s Coffee eJournal_ Published on April 1, 2008--- #### Robert Badgett Robert Badgett recently retired the long running Badgett’s Coffee eJournal, a biweekly email journal that promotes good coffee: buying, brewing, and home roasting our most wonderful beverage.

# Ristretto Rant [Espresso](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/espresso/)---by [Michael Allen Smith](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/michael-allen-smith/)![Ristretto Rant](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/ristretto-rant/IMG_9259.jpg) For the past few years, my coffee drink of choice has been the straight espresso shot. All my other coffee equipment has either been packed away or is gathering dust. For me, it is all about espresso now. The ristretto is a very short shot of espresso. On a given day, half the shots I pull for myself are ristretto shots. Yes, I, too, love the ristretto. Yet, as perfect as the ristretto can be, there can be problems. ### My First Ristretto It must have been 1996. I was living in South Tampa then, and the area finally had a great coffee house. The place was Jet City Espresso. Don’t go looking for it. It is no longer there. As the name implies, the owner, Jessica, was from Seattle and shared her coffee knowledge with her customers. After ordering numerous americanos and espressos, Jessica thought it was time I tried a ristretto. I expected the short pull of the espresso shot would result in a more bitter flavor. To my delight, the shot was actually a sweeter and more intense version of her espresso blend.![Jet City Espresso](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/jet-city-espresso-tampa-19961.cMQsabFP_25yj07.webp)_Jet City Espresso – Tampa 1996_ After leaving the Tampa Bay area and moving away from Jet City Espresso, I would not be served a ristretto again for years. ### The Rise of the Ristretto Now, I’ve arrived in the Seattle area. In this town, the ristretto rules, whether you like it or not. Most cafes in the Seattle area will serve you a ristretto when you order an espresso. My guess is the roaster has determined that the blend tastes optimal when pulled as a ristretto. The first thought I have is positive. If they have tweaked their blend to perfection and then trained their baristas on pulling ristrettos, then the odds are that the drink you are about to get will be amazing. Yet, I’ve been continually disappointed by the ristrettos served here in Seattle. To minimize disappointment, I’d like to share a few rules with the cafes.![Ristretto](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/IMG_9259.hQSMZN2T_Z1JbXGx.webp)_Ristretto_### Ristretto Rules 1. **Ristretto or Espresso** – Let that customer know if a customer orders an espresso and your cafe serves ristrettos as the default. Perhaps ask, _Is a ristretto fine?_ If I peek down and see what appears to be a single shot, when I clearly ordered and was charged for a double shot, I’m either going to inquire or walk away feeling ripped off. A sign prominently displayed can clear up confusion. One cafe buries that information in a newspaper article framed on the wall away from the menu. 2. **Make It Quick**—The time between pouring the ristretto and handing it over to the customer must be quick. A ristretto cools much faster than espresso, so serving it at a less-than-optimal temperature undermines the entire quality of the drink. 3. **Register First, Drink Second** – Nothing is more annoying than when the barista gets ahead of the person working the register. Now, this won’t make any difference for the latte drinkers, but if I’m waiting for change for a $10 bill and my ristretto is cooling on the pick-up stand, I’m not going to be happy. 4. **Heat the Demitasse**—Never pour a ristretto (or espresso) into a cold demitasse. The drink’s temperature will drop instantly. ### The Caffe Calabria Solution [Caffe Calabria](https://ineedcoffee.com/meeting-the-roaster-arne-holt-of-caffe-calabria/) of San Diego has tweaked its espresso blend to taste best as a ristretto. They will serve you a ristretto if you order an espresso. However, they will serve you two ristrettos. The result is that you taste the bold sweetness of the ristretto with the volume of an espresso. The drink isn’t cold, and the customer never feels shortchanged. Published on September 1, 2007--- #### Michael Allen Smith Michael Allen Smith is both a coffee fanatic and a web developer.

But every so often, I’ll meet someone who, after learning about my love for coffee, wants to rant to me about how awful the beverage is and that they would never drink it. I learned how to respond to these people one day during my junior year of high school. I sat in a study hall when a fellow student sat beside me. This guy was known to smoke lots of pot, or so I thought, yet there on the cover of his _Trapper Keeper_ notebook was a huge DARE sticker. D.A.R.E. is an anti-drug educational program for kids. The fact _that Mr. Pot Smoker had this sticker on this notebook struck me as odd, so I pointed at it_ and asked him about it.![DARE sticker](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/dare-sticker.RIxRDpff_Zi1prV.webp)_DARE sticker_ He responded to me with dead seriousness and stated, “You shouldn’t do drugs.” Then, after a long pause, he smiled and said, “More for me.” That day, I learned an important lesson. Whenever someone starts preaching to me about the evils of coffee, I just smile and say, “More for me.”![Monkey Latte Art](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/monkey-latte-art1.Dhdqx3oZ_Z111KTj.webp)_Monkey Latte Art_ Published on May 10, 2010--- #### Michael Allen Smith Michael Allen Smith is both a coffee fanatic and a web developer.

# Roast in Parchment (RIP) Coffee [Roasting Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/roasting-coffee/)---by [Ryan Jacobs](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/ryan-jacobs/)![Roast in Parchment (RIP) Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/roast-in-parchment-rip-coffee/rip-coffee-roasting.jpg) RIP coffee has nothing to do with wishing your coffee a peaceful death. Rather, it is short for Roast In Parchment. It means pretty much what you would expect – the coffee bean is roasted while still in its parchment, and then it is ground and brewed in parchment. Typically, home roasters work with processed coffee to remove the cherry and the parchment surrounding the green bean. Since RIP coffee leaves the parchment in place, there is now another layer between the roasting heat source and the green part of the coffee bean. To roast coffee in parchment, you will use the same technique and equipment as you already do. This may seem fairly obvious, and indeed, you may wonder why you are calling attention to this type of bean. After all, many beans have unique roast profiles and roast quite differently. The reason this is worth calling out is that the parchment has the effect of dulling your traditional roast-monitoring senses. If so, they need to be recalibrated. If you have ever roasted Indian Monsooned Malabar, RIP coffee probably comes closest to this bean. Both are low-density with low chaff output. In some roasters, you may not have enough room to roast without spillover if you are measuring by weight, meaning you’ll need to lower the amount a bit or measure by volume. The photo below shows the two unroasted coffees side by side. On the left side is a typical green varietal, and on the right is the parchment-covered coffee. Not all parchment coffees have the same color or pattern as the example you see here. The color and pattern remind me of a Jelly Belly. Top Banana crossed with Toasted Marshmallow perhaps?![green and RIP coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/rip-compare1.CAY4H8Ly_ZE8ayr.webp)_(left) Typical green coffee (right), parchment-covered coffee._ Inside the reddish parchment, there is actually a green coffee bean. If you remove the parchment, you will find the green bean inside. The photo below shows the green bean that has been liberated from the parchment. You can now see that you would have a regular green coffee bean with just a bit of polishing. It probably goes without saying, but you won’t be removing the outer parchment during the process – it would defeat the whole purpose. However, the picture does give you some sense of the thickness of the parchment – it is about the thickness of a fingernail.![Roast in Parchment](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/roast-in-parchment.Mf4NtnX6_24OEQ4.webp)_Roast in Parchment_ That extra layer of parchment turns out to be a pretty big deal. Virtually everything you will read on home coffee roasting is based on the premise of roasting just the green bean. Advice on listening for sounds, looking for color changes, and even the sense of smell is geared toward the green bean. Apart from the roast process, the flavor is different, and the grind is affected. ### Sound Differences In traditional coffee roasting, listening for the first and second cracks is commonplace. In RIP coffee, this is still the case. However, the added layer of parchment muffles the sound of the cracking, making it harder to hear. It is quieter and less crisp. I found it much more difficult to pick up on the cracking sounds while using my Hearthware II roaster, which has a very loud fan mechanism. Switching to the Poppery II, which has a fan that is relatively quiet compared to the Hearthware, made it much easier to distinguish the sounds. Your mileage may vary depending on your roasting device. ### Visual Differences Just as there are differences in sounds in RIP coffee roasting, so are the visual differences. The biggest thing to get used to is that what you are actually viewing during the darkening process is the parchment, not the green coffee. While it does darken, it doesn’t do so at the same rate or in the same manner as green coffee. For example, a RIP coffee at Vienna Roast doesn’t appear oily on the outside – the oils are on the inside of the parchment. Instead, I found that some parchment would bubble up like a burned marshmallow. You can sort of get a sense of that in the photos below.![Parchment Covered Roast](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/visual-rip-roast.B2kAWR0A_Z1D7h0z.webp)_Parchment Covered Roast_![Completed Parchment Covered Roast](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/rip-roast-complete.zAyZrwPU_So99g.webp)_Completed Parchment Covered Roast_ Because the parchment prevents you from seeing the development of the actual coffee bean inside the parchment, I found that the more reliable way to determine the roast level was by listening for cracks over the appearance of the parchment. Over time, as your senses are recalibrated, it will be easier to determine the roast level visually. ### Worth the Effort? I don’t think it is by accident that we don’t normally roast, grind, and brew parchment with the coffee. I didn’t think that the coffee as a single note knocked my socks off, but I could see where some of the earthy notes would work well in an espresso blend. Unfortunately, I found it practically impossible to grind properly for espresso. It works much better as a blend for coffee destined for French Press or vac pot. Personally, I am not convinced that the juice was worth the squeeze purely on a flavor benchmark. On the other hand, it is by no means the worst coffee I have ever roasted and there is a certain novelty to working with coffee in the parchment. If I ever come across something called RIC Coffee, as in Roasted in Cherry I’ll have to pass. Someone else can get ‘RIC Rolled’.

# Roast Your Own Coffee [Roasting Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/roasting-coffee/)---by [Ryan Jacobs](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/ryan-jacobs/)![Roast Your Own Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/roast-your-own-coffee/Roast-Your-Own-Coffee.jpg) Roasting your own coffee is not only personally satisfying, but it is also relatively easy. You don’t really need the expense of a Probat or Diedrich roaster to begin this craft. Using nothing more than a hot air popcorn popper, you can achieve a very high level of freshness and control your roast level. You’ll even save some money along the way. In this article, I will break down the basic steps into categories: 1. What you should know before beginning 2. Selecting your equipment 3. Selecting your beans 4. The actual roasting process 5. Cooling and storing the beans. ### What You Should Know Before Beginning Roasting your own coffee gives you virtually unlimited possibilities in your quest for making the perfect cup. You are able to make espresso roasts or bring your beans to a nice full city roast. You can blend your different roasted beans or blend them before roasting. It’s up to you. Do you want to be able to drink five varieties a week without having your coffee go stale? Since you roast only what you need, you can do this with ease. In a nutshell, you’ll be able to drink better coffee for less money. Green coffee will store well for over a year without a loss in character whereas roasted coffee will be best consumed within a week or two. Buying your beans green will allow you to make larger purchases without worrying about the beans going bad. Roasting coffee in a popcorn popper can be a messy venture. During the roasting process, pieces of green coffee called chaff will blow off while producing a great amount of smoke. While the smoke smells great initially, it will find its way into everything in your homestead, and once stale, it stinks. In the beginning, the easiest course of action is to find a place to roast outside, such as a garage, porch, or balcony. Along the way, you may upgrade your equipment to devices such as the [Hearthware iRoast2](https://ineedcoffee.com/roasting-coffee-in-a-popcorn-popper/) with a built-in chaff filter or the [HotTop](https://ineedcoffee.com/hottop-kn-8828p-coffee-bean-roaster-first-look/) with a built-in smoke filter.![green coffee beans](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/green-coffee-beans1.CC8yT976_Z16YPQr.webp)_Green Coffee Beans_### Equipment and Coffee Bean Selection First, you will want to purchase a roaster. You want a device that will heat the beans to at least 400 degrees F and be able to do this in an even manner. You may be thinking of your oven, and while that will work, it is somewhat difficult to gauge the roast level visually, and usually will set off your smoke detector if you don’t have good air filtration. It also produces scorched beans since one side of them is in constant contact with the hot metal of the sheet pan. A good device to start with is a West Bend Poppery II. For a tutorial on roasting coffee using the original Poppery see the tutorial [Roasting Coffee in a Popcorn Popper](https://ineedcoffee.com/roasting-coffee-in-a-popcorn-popper/). This little hot air popcorn popper makes a great coffee roaster. The reason this is a good unit is that it allows for good visual inspection of the roast level, and it actually moves the beans around in a circular fashion, which prevents scorching. The hot air blowing the beans around is commonly referred to as _fluid-bed_ roasting. The Poppery II is often available at thrift stores for a few bucks. After you get a roaster, you should have a cooling pan, a stirrer, and a scale. For the cooling pan, you want something that will allow a mass of hot beans to cool as quickly as possible. I use an aluminum pasta strainer. The holes let air through for more rapid cooling. You may also use a simple cookie sheet. Even though the popper rotates the beans, you will still need something to help stir beans and even to pull samples out for closer inspection. For stirring use a wooden spoon. Make certain it is wooden or you could get an electrical shock. A measuring device for coffee would be best done with a scale. You can use an inexpensive food scale found almost anywhere, such as Wal-Mart or Target. Some of the newer digital scales offer excellent taring features and give you a better gauge resolution than the really cheap analog types. The primary reason for measuring by weight over volume is that your popper can only move so much weight at a time, and you will find that different beans have different densities. The only way to get consistent results is to measure the coffee by weight. For the West Bend, four oz. is your target weight.![Westbend Poppery 2](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/popper250.jNGnSsw2_1Gskwr.webp)_Westbend Popper II: terrible for popcorn, but good for home coffee roasting._### Coffee Bean Selection: The beans you select ultimately define your taste preferences, and if the flavor is at the top of your list, you will want to choose an Arabica coffee bean. To be very simplistic, a good bean is generally uniform in shape and color. You will find that these normally roast evenly and without many “clinkers” or bad beans. If you are just beginning, you should ask other home roasters what they have had luck with. From experience, Colombian and Costa Rican coffees, along with many Guatemalans, roast pretty easily. Sumatra coffees roast nicely, but you must believe the imperfections will work out in the roasting process. ### Starting The Roast Now that everything is together, you should plug your “roaster” in and pour your beans in. You should immediately begin stirring the coffee beans. As you stir, you will notice the coffee beans turn from green to light brown and continually darken. Also, part of the bean called chaff will begin blowing off the bean. Keep stirring until the beans move on their own upward (not just circularly). This will take about a minute. Now, you will hear a series of small “cracking” noises. This is what is known as the first crack. This will soon subside.![pour coffee into roaster](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/pour250.CXOYboZt_Z2vXpmz.webp)_Pour the green coffee beans into the popcorn popper roaster._![stir roast](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/stir250.C-aqGhtJ_22YA5o.webp)_Early in the roast, slowly stir coffee beans with a wooden spoon._### Monitoring The Roast Now, monitor the coffee beans and watch for the color of beans you desire. Pay attention to the smells as well. If you let your roast continue long enough, you will notice the second series of cracks. This is known as (you guessed it) the second crack. Little tiny black chips will start blowing off the bean during this phase. To achieve a full city roast, you should normally stop at the beginning of this series of cracks. If you would like the darker roast of a typical Espresso blend or a French or Vienna roast, you should keep the beans roasting. You will notice the beans becoming shiny and a thicker cloud of smoke coming from the roast chamber. The sheen comes from the oils of the bean, which are coming to the surface.![coffee roast color progression](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/popcorn-coffee-roast-colors.DPjZvazd_QLDpy.webp)_Color progression in the coffee roast inside the popcorn popper._![Brew French Press](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/check-the-roast.GvpsIHac_Z1ufHaH.webp)_Using the wooden spoon, periodically take samples to judge the progress of the coffee roast._### The Cooling Process The main objective of the cooling process is to stop the roasting dead in its tracks as fast as possible. Simply dump the coffee beans into your cooling pan, which will allow them to lie in a single layer. Using a pan with holes, such as a metal colander, will aid this. If you live in a hot climate, you might consider using a [light mist of water](https://ineedcoffee.com/popper-roasting-tips/) from a spray bottle.![cooling the coffee roast](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/cooling-the-coffee-roast.CYX12qXn_ZzfGzS.webp)_This technique uses two colanders to cool the coffee beans rapidly._ Once the roasted coffee beans have cooled, they should be stored properly in an [airtight container](https://ineedcoffee.com/coffee-storage/). ### Conclusion Once you’ve assembled the tools, you will find roasting your own coffee from home as easy as boiling eggs. Grab that popcorn popper and start roasting! FYI: Once you’ve roasted coffee beans in the popper, use something else for your popcorn. ### Resources [Roasting Coffee in a Popcorn Popper](https://ineedcoffee.com/roasting-coffee-in-a-popcorn-popper/) – INeedCoffee tutorial on roasting coffee in the Westbend Poppery.

# Roast Your Own Beans [Roasting Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/roasting-coffee/)---by [James Cameron](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/james-cameron/)![Roast Your Own Beans](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/roast-your-own-beans/home-roasting-book1.jpg) For years, the idea of roasting your own coffee beans has been kept a mystery by the coffee roasting industry. It had been deemed “too hard” or “too complicated”. Well these are new times and the truth is out; it’s easy, fun, and economical and can be done in a number of ways using items you probably already own! There is nothing like a cup of coffee, which has been freshly roasted, ground, and brewed to perfection. There are a growing number of enthusiasts who are roasting their own coffee beans and enjoying the benefits of truly fresh coffee at about one-third to one-half the price of beans from your local coffee shop. All that is needed to roast your own coffee beans at home is green coffee beans, available from a number of sources, an oven, cookie sheet, oven mitt, metal colander, and a wooden spoon. Preheat your oven to 500F, spread raw beans evenly one layer deep on a cookie sheet, place them on the middle rack of a preheated oven and watch them roast. In about 8-10 minutes there will be a crackling noise and smoke with coffee essence. At this point, the roast moves quickly and you need to pay close attention. About 2-3 minutes after the crackling, your coffee beans should be in the shade you like them. Carefully (using the oven mitt) remove the cookie sheet from the oven and pour the beans into the metal colander. Stir the beans with a wooden spoon to help them cool quickly. Do this over a sink or outside, as there is chaff that comes off the beans during roasting. And remember: NEVER leave your roasting coffee beans unattended.![home roasting book](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/home-roasting-book1.DKCXphch_ZxBOFd.webp) Almost any appliance used to pop popcorn can be used to roast coffee beans. The [hot air poppers](https://ineedcoffee.com/roasting-coffee-in-a-popcorn-popper/) are great, however, you may want to roast outside or in your garage as they blow the chaff out and can be messy. There are a number of manufacturers of home coffee roasters, including several that use a gas grill and rotisserie. The internet is full of sources to purchase raw beans, but you want to make certain the supplier you use knows their beans and “cups” their coffee before selling it to you (see resources below). Many other sources can be found using your favorite search engine. If you’re interested in using a gas grill to roast your beans there are several manufacturers of drums fitted for gas grills that work great (see resources below). Green, raw coffee beans last for years when properly stored. This allows you to build a collection of fine coffees to choose from as well as buy larger amounts of the great coffees and save more money. Keep your bean collection in a cool, dry place out of any direct sunlight and they will last until you roast them. As coffee ages, it loses acidity and becomes more mellow. Many like the rich mild cup of coffee that has had a couple of years to rest and mellow. More important than the year of the crop is the quality of the bean, the preparation at origin, transportation, and warehousing in the country of consumption. If all of these things are done correctly, your green coffee will last for years. Suppliers who know how to cup samples of coffee beans are able to determine if all of these criteria are done correctly before they purchase the beans. Home roasting is one of the fastest-growing hobbies in the country and for good reason. It’s fun, easy, saves you money, and delivers a cup of coffee like you never thought was possible. Join in the fun and start roasting your own coffee beans. ### Resources [Home Roasting Coffee in an Oven](https://ineedcoffee.com/home-roasting-coffee-in-an-oven/) – Tutorial on roasting coffee at home using an oven.

# Roast Your Own E-Book [Roasting Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/roasting-coffee/)---by [Chris Arnold](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/chris-arnold/)![Roast Your Own E-Book](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/roast-your-own-e-book/1-roast-your-own.jpg) As an experienced Home Coffee Roaster, I was interested in an eBook for the iPad titled _“Roast your own. A simple guide for making delicious coffee (snob-free)”_  by Samuel Harvey and Benji Newell with videos by Sam Griffith. At this time, this title is only available for the iPad.![Roast Your Own e-book](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/1-roast-your-own.CCdkipDu_2mwKmi.webp)_Roast your own. A simple guide for making delicious coffee (snob-free)_ First of all, at 64 pages and embedded videos, I would not call this a “simple guide”. It might be explained simply, but there is a lot of information to take in for the beginner. I can tell you that most of the advice is spot-on. One point: the eBook on the iPad is very slow as you scroll through pages, and it tends to show the loading icon often. I need to get in contact with the authors as to why, but I suspect it is because of the media-rich content they chose to include. The book is nicely broken down into the following chapters: - Author’s Note - Why Roast Your Own? - Beans - Roasting - Grinding - Brewing - And Then What? This going to be a mini-review, which means for each chapter, I will make a comment or two, along with a screenshot. ### Author’s Note The author’s story intro is brief but gives a nice background on what got these guys into coffee. They sound like the rest of us, which I think is great. It definitely draws you in. ### Why Roast Your Own? I do like how they explain the typical user and how much they spend on coffee, and then go on to let us know that it is easy and cheap to roast your own, with even better quality than what you can typically get at the store. The 6 points of “Coffee Priorities” are nice: 1. Get the best coffee you can afford 2. Brew with water that is hot enough 3. Grind coffee right before you brew 4. Pre-warm the cups and brewing vessel 5. Use a consistent grind 6. Use filtered water![Coffee Priorities](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/2-coffee-list.Rg_L4VFf_1bPdNE.webp)_Coffee Priorities_ I think the diagram “Interactive B” is a little confusing, and takes away rather than adds. Fortunately, this is the exception, as most other diagrams are excellent.![Time and effort](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/3-time-and-effort.NZSz_cVL_b6A2l.webp)_Time and effort_### Beans They do have a video of Sweet Maria’s, touted by the authors as “Our favorite provider of green specialty coffee”. Some other vendors that get a nod are Burman Coffee, Coffee Bean Corral, and Coffee Bean Direct. I have purchased from all of them, and they are all decent retailers. One aspect of green coffee bean buying they did not explore is the Co-Op scene. See the article [Green Coffee Buying Club (aka GCBC)](https://ineedcoffee.com/meeting-up-with-the-green-coffee-buying-club/) for more info.![Your final cup will only be as good as your beans](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/4-final-cup.DQn775a1_Z1fkA63.webp)_“Your final cup will only be as good as your beans.”_### Roasting I like the Basic Roast Levels diagram. It really makes things crystal clear.![Basic Roast Levels](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/5-roast-levels.CIUo7_Ls_ZAa1A0.webp)_Basic Roast Levels_ I found the home methods they suggest interesting: [Popcorn popper](https://ineedcoffee.com/roasting-coffee-in-a-popcorn-popper/), [Heat gun](https://ineedcoffee.com/roasting-coffee-with-a-heat-gun-a-top-down-approach/), and [Whirley pop](https://ineedcoffee.com/stovetop-roasting-with-the-whirley-pop/). I have used them all, and while they do work, using them inevitably leads to commercially produced consumer coffee roasters that provide more volume, better temp control, smoke suppressors, etc. I wish they would have delved into some of those consumer machines, that also won’t break the bank. Or at least whet our appetite for another eBook when you are ready to spend some more money.![Home Roasting Methods](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/6-roast-methods.CKQ3sqdh_ZEtG0l.webp)_Home Roasting Methods_### Grinding They do show two levels of grind (French Press and Filter) as compared to a dime. Would have liked to have seen Aeropress or some others just for comparison. See the article [Coffee Grind Chart](https://ineedcoffee.com/coffee-grind-chart/) for more comparisons of grind sizes.![Grinding](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/7-grind.C-e5QB5F_Z1WU9VE.webp)_Grinding_ They only show two types of [gri](https://ineedcoffee.com/choosing-the-right-coffee-grinder/)n [ders](https://ineedcoffee.com/choosing-the-right-coffee-grinder/) (burr hand mill and spice blender). Again, there are machines out there that can do a great job, offer more volume, do it quicker, and don’t break the bank. ### Brewing They show [French Press](https://ineedcoffee.com/press-pot-tutorial/), [Clever Coffee Dripper](https://ineedcoffee.com/the-clever-coffee-dripper/), and Automatic Drip. They make excuses for why they didn’t include pour-over, [vac pots](https://ineedcoffee.com/vacuum-pot-brewing/), or espresso. And I agree with that. But what about the [Aeropress](https://ineedcoffee.com/aeropress-coffee-maker-tutorial/)? While this eBook really focuses on roasting, with other aspects being secondary, I found the FREE Intelligentsia app, more useful for the preparation of coffee, as well as more expansive. See the article [Intelligentsia iPhone App Review](https://ineedcoffee.com/intelligentsia-iphone-app-review/) for more information on that application. ### And Then What? They give some nice reference material for Tasting, Coffee Terms, Troubleshooting, and even a roast chart.![Coffee Terms](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/8-explore.Do0EZT2a_1GVNB8.webp)_Coffee Terms_### Conclusion**Pros**- Great info for the beginner, explaining home roasting, brewing, and beyond - Nicely done diagrams and embedded videos**Cons**- Performance is slow and takes away from an otherwise great resource ### Resourses [Meeting Up With The Green Coffee Buying Club](https://ineedcoffee.com/meeting-up-with-the-green-coffee-buying-club/) – The interview topic is how green coffee buying cooperative clubs work.

# Roasting Coffee at Home With the Nesco Coffee Bean Roaster [Roasting Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/roasting-coffee/)---by [Karen Lopez](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/karen-lopez/)![Roasting Coffee at Home With the Nesco Coffee Bean Roaster](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/roasting-coffee-home-nesco-coffee-bean-roaster/nesco-roast-start.jpg) I must confess a couple of things before I talk about my experience with the Nesco Professional Home Roaster. My first confession is that I drink coffee roasted by a coffee giant who shall remain unnamed and when I actually look at their roasted beans – they look pretty dark! I know many people say that these beans are over-roasted and bitter and they may be right BUT it’s what I know. My other confession is that I was not all that familiar with home-roasted coffee…that is until two weeks ago. I tried my first roasting session with my mom using a [stovetop popcorn popper](https://ineedcoffee.com/stovetop-roasting-with-the-whirley-pop/) with mixed results. Because we both had only a vague idea of what we were doing, the beans turned out too dark in one roasting session and brown-ish in two other sessions (probably okay to use but I haven’t tried them yet!). The long and the short of it is that stovetop roasting can be inconsistent if you have no idea what you are doing. I’m sure home roasting experts would tell my Mom and me that “practice makes perfect” and that we should experiment some more with temperature and time for the stovetop roasting but in this busy world, who has time to “get it right?”![nesco-roaster](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/nesco-roaster.Doh8XUou_Z2oO9x2.webp)_The Nesco Coffee Roaster_  ### The Nesco Coffee Bean Roaster Why the preamble? Well, if there is anyone out there who wants freshly roasted coffee beans but doesn’t have the guts to roast on the stovetop or who doesn’t have the time to experiment, this Nesco Home Roaster may be the small appliance they need. It takes the guesswork out of roasting the beans and it takes a maximum of 30-35 minutes for the whole process to occur. This includes the 5-minute cooldown cycle. I will share my experience with this roaster so you can decide for yourself if this machine is right for you. Ask yourself: Are you adventurous, or do you just want your roasted beans now? Oh, and by the way, it’s a nice-looking appliance so it can sit on top of the countertop – maybe even beside your espresso/latte machine. Read on… ### Initial Cleaning The first thing worth noting with the easy-to-follow instructions is that you have to clean the glass component with soapy water to prevent the “new smell” from invading the roasted beans. That wasn’t bad except when it came to drying the inside of the glass. The rotor took up space, so it was hard to get a cloth in there to get all of the water out. However, I grabbed a chopstick and a paper towel and stuck them far enough to soak up any remaining droplets of water. No problem! I would suggest that if you are using the machine for the first time, wash and leave to dry the parts way ahead of time for a natural drying process. ### The Roast The one thing that I was struck by with this machine is that it didn’t hold a lot of green beans. There is a maximum fill line and a lower line for dark roasts. You get enough in there for one pot of coffee and then some (depending on how strong you like it and how many cups of coffee you drink a day) but at least it’s freshly roasted. With a little planning ahead, you can stockpile roasted beans so running out isn’t an issue. The “dark roast” fill line allows about 115 grams (1/4 lb) of green beans, just enough for a pot of coffee. The “fill line” allows for 141 grams of green beans. Roasting coffee will reduce the weight of the beans by 15-20%, so account for that as well. Nesco recommends the following roast times: - Light Roast: 20-22 minutes - Medium Roast: 23-26 minutes - Dark Roast: 27-30+ minutes They further advise: > Roast times may vary due to ambient room temperature, power/voltage, bean variety or amounts used in each batch. Adjust time settings accordingly.![nesco-roast-start](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/nesco-roast-start.DNIx04Kc_Z2sB11U.webp)_Add Green Coffee Beans to the Coffee Roaster_ The rest of the process was pretty easy. Just input your time and press start. The machine does the rest while you sit there and watch the beans change colour.![nesco-control-panel](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/nesco-control-panel.1wcuH43U_2bIde0.webp)_Input roast time in minutes and press start._ ![nesco-roasting-early](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/nesco-roasting-early.SYaBe8zi_Z1yJgga.webp)![nesco-roasting-coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/nesco-roasting-coffee.DpYRVCIz_ZAJPYN.webp)_The coffee beans will darken as the roast progresses._### Ending the Roast As the roast progresses, you have the option to add or reduce roasting time. The Nesco roaster is a bit on the loud side so hearing the coffee enter first or second crack might be difficult. This means you will primarily use the color of the beans to determine how long the roast lasts. At any time you wish to end the roast, you can press the COOL button. This will instantly initiate the 5-minute cooling cycle. At the end of the 5-minute cooling cycle, the roaster will still be warm to the touch. Nesco recommends letting it sit for an additional 10 minutes before retrieving the roasted coffee. When you remove the coffee, you’ll also be emptying the chaff tray which sits above the coffee. I poured the beans onto a cookie tray to accelerate the cooling. After the beans reach room temperature, you can store them in a jar.![nesco-empty-roasted-coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/nesco-empty-roasted-coffee.D-p_hQKk_Z1o50MI.webp)_Emptying the roasted coffee from the Nesco._![chaff-collector](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/chaff-collector.Cb1uIdoF_1XU3bk.webp)_This is the chaff collector after a roast. Wipe it clean before starting the next batch of coffee._### Noise and Smoke Two things I worried about (based on my experience with the stovetop popper two weeks earlier) were the noise factor and the smoke factor. Both can be unpleasant if you let it get the best of you or if you don’t have a powerful hood fan or a big gust of wind to take the smoke and smell away. I was pleasantly surprised that the Nesco wasn’t too loud, and it didn’t have the smoke issues that I experienced when I roasted with the stovetop popcorn popper. The Nesco machine has a catalytic converter that takes away most of roasted bean smoke. It didn’t take ALL of it away, but it sure was better than stovetop roasting. Because I didn’t have the hood fan on when I roasted on the stovetop, the smoke was overpowering, and I could barely see my Mom at the other end of the kitchen (we were making a video, so we couldn’t have the fan going)! We also had no idea what we were doing so we had the stove set too high.![nesco-dog-roast](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/nesco-dog-roast.CvUS_DSq_ZaFbI.webp)_The dog enjoys watching the coffee roast._  ### Conclusion The next morning, I tried the beans that I had roasted and was pleasantly surprised. The beans weren’t as dark as I’m used to but the taste was nutty and very good. Because they were lighter, I could let them rest a few days longer to see how the flavor developed. One tip I would like to share is that I would extend the roasting process to the maximum allowable time, which is 35 minutes. The extra 5 minutes would have darkened them to the colour that I’m used to, even though many roasters would probably tell me my taste buds are shot! Overall, my experience was positive. This machine is perfect for someone wanting freshly roasted coffee daily. Stockpiling the coffee for the week would be my suggestion since it doesn’t hold a ton of beans. If you want to roast a higher volume of coffee at once, you might consider seeking out another roasting method. You could use the stovetop popcorn popper or a drum roaster such as the [Behmor](https://ineedcoffee.com/behmor-1600-coffee-roaster-tutorial/) or [Hottop](https://ineedcoffee.com/hottop-kn-8828p-coffee-bean-roaster-first-look/). If you want to play it safe, or if you don’t really know what you are doing but know you want fresh roasts, use the Nesco. The smell in the house is kept to a minimum, and I woke up in the morning not even smelling the roast. Sometimes, dinner smells linger more than coffee. I think the average consumer needs to think differently about roasted coffee. There is a certain mystery we all have about the roasting of coffee and these machines take the mystery away and allow the “Average Joe” to be creative and roast their own beans/blends in the comfort of their own kitchen! We have to start thinking about roasting at home like we are cooking a meal….everyone can do it with a little bit of experimentation and experience. ### Resources [U-Roast-It Coffee](https://www.u-roast-it-coffee.ca/collections/home-roasting-equipment) – Nesco Coffee Roast product page (CANADA).

# Roasting Coffee at Home Has Never Been Easier [Roasting Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/roasting-coffee/)---by [Asher Yaron](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/asher-yaron/)![Roasting Coffee at Home Has Never Been Easier](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/roasting-coffee-at-home-has-never-been-easier/power-roaster-asher.jpg) #### Become a Master Coffee Roaster right in your own kitchen. Bali coffee guru Asher Yaron and business partner Raymond Lay have just launched a revolutionary new home coffee roaster. “We’re making home coffee roasting a simple and affordable practice,” said Yaron. “This roaster is designed to significantly change coffee making and drinking habits around the world.”![Power Roaster](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/power-roaster.w90KDeFv_1erHyM.webp) Starting with green coffee beans and using the Fluid Bed Roasting technique, the power roaster has a capacity of 120 grams per batch at an average of six minutes per roast. It operates with a simple on/off switch and is much quicker and cleaner than traditional drum roasters. The beans are roasted until the desired color is achieved: light, medium, or dark. “What we’re seeing is the emergence of the Fourth Wave in coffee,” Yaron said, referencing the transition in coffee epochs. “Coffee drinkers are finally starting to care about the effect of the drink — the energy and the clarity it gives them — as much as they do about taste. Roasting, brewing, and then drinking coffee in quick succession improves the effects significantly.” At a price point of USD $300 (which includes 1 kilo — 2.2 lbs. — of green coffee), it is estimated that a typical retail café customer will see an average savings of more than $1000 annually. The machine, aptly named the Power Roaster, is being offered in a Kickstarter Campaign.**[www.kickstarter.com/projects/2017098884/coffee-roasting-in-your-own-kitchen-with-the-power](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/2017098884/coffee-roasting-in-your-own-kitchen-with-the-power)** Backers in the Campaign will receive Early Bird Discounts as well as free shipping.

# Roasting and Brewing Toddy Cat Coffee [Roasting Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/roasting-coffee/)---by [Allen J Pais](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/allen-j-pais/)_For background information on Toddy Cat Coffee, please read [Toddy Cat Coffee Beans](https://ecofriendlycoffee.org/toddy-cat-coffee-beans/) and [Toddy Cat Coffee Bean Process](https://ecofriendlycoffee.org/toddy-cat-coffee-bean-process/)._ One of the most critical steps in normal coffee and Toddy-Civet Cat coffee production is the roasting process. It has implications on coffee taste, aroma, and colour, and therefore has an overall effect on the quality of the coffee. Although all steps are important, roasting is a key element in the process used to obtain coffee because this process gives the beans the aspect known by consumers. The taste and the aroma are acquired by roasting the beans. This is the reason why it is said that brands obtain different coffees even when they use the same type of bean. There are several ways to roast coffee: one is by using a simple pan, the other is the gas rotary drum roaster, and the last one is the hot air roaster. We use a simple process of roasting the Toddy-Civet Cat beans on a hot pan and powdering the beans using a simple electric mixer. Below, find the Steps to Prepare the Roasted Toddy-Civet Cat ROBUSTA Coffee Bean Powder.![roast-civit](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/roast-civit1.UQA2TSl9_2dkxK2.webp)_Roast the dried coffee beans in a Hot Pan_![roast-civit2](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/roast-civit2.J1uRSDu0_ZwO1RM.webp)_Roast the coffee beans until dark brown_![roast-civit3](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/roast-civit3.t4RIuMaC_1Gsq6b.webp)_Verify the coffee beans are emitting the coffee fragrance._![civit-grinder](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/civit-grinder.-Gaxbw-T_ZTldtX.webp)_Grind the coffee beans to a fine powder._![civit powder](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/grinder600.8dQzWCO3_Z2siM0V.webp)_The Toddy-Civet Cat Robusta Coffee Bean Powder Is Ready To Be Used_![civit-roast-to-grind](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/civit-roast-to-grind.CnCiHwNT_ZEVCk0.webp)_The Three Roasting Stages_ The powdered Robusta Coffee powder (Toddy-Civet Cat Coffee Powder) is now ready. ### Preparation Simplified Method 1. Take a 500 ml Hot water flask and pour in boiling water. 2. Take 2 Tablespoons of Toddy-Civet Cat Coffee powder and pour it into boiling water. 3. Cap the flask and wait for 20 minutes. 4. Turn the flask upside down in between the 20 minutes around 2 times with an interval of 5 minutes and wait for the particles of Coffee to settle down to the bottom of the flask. 5. Open the lid of the flask, and now your PIPING HOT CUP OF UNIQUE TODDY CAT COFFEE is ready to be relished. 6. Pour the Coffee into a cup. 7. Serve Coffee for 4 with milk and sugar as desired. ### Roasting With Hot Air A hot-air roaster is an efficient process since the beans have no contact with any metal hot part, which can roast some beans more than others. The advantage of this roaster is that as the control process is electronic, all roasting steps can be set electronically having a repeatable uniform result. The disadvantage of the gas rotary roaster is that it cannot roast in small quantities (but there are some home models that do the job). In the case of Toddy-Civet Cat, it is essential to have a roaster that can work in small quantities because this coffee is not a product of massive consumption. The beans should be roasted when ordered by customers so that they can always have freshly roasted Toddy-Civet Cat coffee. Coming back to the roasting process, coffee needs to be roasted at a temperature between 220⁰ C and 230⁰ C (440⁰ F). While coffee is being roasted, it releases oil and sugar, it grows in size and it loses humidity, and its final weight reduces by 20%. The chemical components of the bean suffer from important transformations both at a quantity and quality level. Sugar, fat, proteins, non-protein nitrogenous substances, acids, etc; In fact, everything suffers from a transformation due to the high temperatures that the beans are exposed to. Like other coffee types, Toddy-Civet Cat is medium roasted, as not to destroy the complex flavors acquired during both processes. Afterward, the beans need to be cooled quickly to stop the roasting process and to allow the aroma to be fixed and the oil substances to be condensed. It is recommended to grind them and prepare the coffee, not before 12 hours of having been roasted. ### Video Tutorial [How To Make Roasted Coffee Home Made](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JxPWE-2Hdk) (YouTube 7 minutes) ### References Thank you to Errol Pais (Coffee Planter) from “Pais Estate” Siddapur and Dr. Anand Titus Pereira.

# Roasting Coffee: Conduit Coffee Roasters Seattle [Coffee People](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/coffee-people/)---by [Joseph Robertson](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/joseph-robertson/)![Roasting Coffee: Conduit Coffee Roasters Seattle](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/roasting-coffee-conduit-coffee-roasters-seattle/conduit-coffee-roasters.jpg) Visiting a coffee roaster is an amazing opportunity to widen the coffee experience. At Conduit Coffee Roasters, Jesse has the bags of green coffee stored in the same room that he roasts – a tiny room of perhaps 60 square feet, but with tall 15-foot ceilings. He has in the ‘entrance’ to the room a loft built above the door, which serves as extra storage space. Underneath are huge bags of green coffee off the ground on a wood platform, and shelves with freshly roasted coffee in bins. The bags are large – probably about 4 feet high and perhaps 2 feet in diameter sitting, with 152 pounds of green coffee beans inside (69 kilos). They are typically burlap sacks, often with green plastic liners. Sometimes the beans are delivered without a liner, but typically if the coffee is more expensive, it will be double bagged for extra protection (though at some cost of airflow, which I understand is important). Today I had the opportunity for the first time to fully inhale a fresh bag full of green coffee. The experience is phenomenal. The assault upon my senses was magnificent, in a way that cannot possibly be truly communicated by words alone. But let me have a go at it.![Jesse roasting](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/jesse-roaster1.yCNfH--1_Z27d92R.webp) We opened a bag from Nicaragua, and I stooped over with my face right near the green coffee beans and inhaled deeply through my nose. I instantly felt like I was in a forest surrounded by coffee plants. You can really smell the aroma of freshness coming off the beans – like any other type of fresh produce. These Nicaraguan beans are very well grown – and more on the expensive side — so they have a very distinct, strong aroma (and when roasted well, they retain a similar flavor). With this particular bag, my first impression was that of fruity dark chocolate. That is what instantly popped into my mind – it was as if I had shoved my head in a bag of dark chocolate bars. I couldn’t really put a finger on what the fruit was – and often it turns out that is the case. The smell is incredibly powerful coming right off the raw beans – you can almost taste it. The second bag that we opened was from Ethiopia. After a full inhale, my first impression was ‘bananas’. Really what we were experiencing was just an incredibly strong fruit aroma – even though the Nicaraguan struck me as fruity chocolate, it was more of a cacao aroma. The Ethiopian beans, on the other hand, were full-on fruit – as if I were picking a banana fresh off the tree. I couldn’t say exactly why it smelled of bananas – and Jesse didn’t have an answer either – but that was my impression.![green coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/green-coffee.CfOSPva-_Z4nSbg.webp) Roasting is as much an art as it is a science. There are ‘rules of thumb’ that a roaster follows, but they are by no means the be all end all. In order to achieve a certain flavor after roasting, it is often simply a matter of following some general guidelines and using the initial aroma as a sense of what the coffee perhaps ‘should’ taste like in the end. So it is ok at the beginning when you can’t pinpoint exactly what an aroma is – it’s more about the whole experience. This brings up another point that is of interest to me – you may have wondered why coffee often smells better than it tastes. I’ve even seen articles that go on to try to explain this phenomenon, looking at how our smell receptors treat aroma differently after we have swallowed the beverage and how that impacts flavor. Thus far my reaction to this phenomenon is simple: if the coffee doesn’t taste as good as it smells, you are either drinking coffee that is not grown well, not roasted well, or not prepared well in the end. There are so many different factors that go into creating a coffee that a misstep at any point can affect this experience. I’ve had the pleasure of a cup of coffee that truly tastes as good as it smells. Let me take you through the roasting process – as this is the first time I’ve ever visited a roaster, I got a first-hand look, and I hope to share that with you. Future visits will no doubt uncover subtle nuances, but today I want to share with you what I learned from Conduit Coffee Roasters.![Dietrich coffee roaster](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/dietrich-coffee-roaster.B3DowRQF_1gBbPR.webp) First, we start with green coffee. Something you may not know (though it makes sense) is that coffee is seasonal. Not all coffees are available at all times. For example, what is in season right now (February/March) are coffees from high-altitude Central and South American countries – Nicaragua, for example. This doesn’t mean you can’t get coffee from other regions at different times of the year – green coffee tends to store fairly well, from between 6 to 12 months. According to Jesse here at Conduit, some coffees even improve after sitting for a period of time. There are natural changes that happen to the green coffee as it sits. So just because one coffee is not in season, doesn’t mean it’s not available.![Conduit Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/conduit-coffee.B0z5aL0u_2akWaB.webp) The roasting process itself is somewhat simple, yet potentially infinitely complex. The basic concept: green coffee is placed in the hopper at the top of the roaster – typically Jesse roasts in 10-pound batches. The roaster itself is preheated, and then the coffee is added. The roaster rotates the beans around vertically, then after a predetermined period of time (in Jesse’s case, that is often around 15 minutes), they spit out into a cooling mechanism. This is where the freshly roasted beans are spun around to cool the beans – the roaster itself sucks outside cool air down through the beans. This setup also allows for the person roasting to quality control the beans through the whole process – a real hands-on experience. This is, in essence, the process, but it can be infinitely complex. The roasting machine – in this case, a Diedrich – is able to track the temperature inside the coffee beans. As a guideline, roasters use ‘roasting curves’ – which is a graphed guideline of temperature vs time. The curve describes the temperature rise in the beans over time and typically marks the first and second crack points. The ‘crack’ is when the bean physically cracks, which happens at a certain temperature, usually in the range of 400-405 degrees Fahrenheit. Typically, roasting is taken to at least the first crack when the bean becomes edible and then sometimes for a second time. Some roasters will take the bean past the second crack – Starbucks, for example, always takes their beans past the second crack. The amount of time that you roast the beans naturally has a direct impact on the ending flavor. Most of the varied flavors of coffee are dependent upon the quality of the green coffee to start – for example, the aromas I described in smelling the green coffee can be had in the roasted coffee, if the roaster treats the beans properly. As Jesse says, roasting is about ‘enunciating’ the flavor of the coffee. In general the longer you roast, the more flavor you lose, and I shall attempt to explain why that is.![Coffee roaster](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/coffee-roaster.UOLgsvpb_2meTU1.webp) Primarily, there are two elements of the coffee bean that are responsible for the flavors – the acids and the lipids. The acids are more delicate and can be roasted out of the bean by roasting longer. They are often responsible for bright, punchy flavors in coffee. The lipids tend to stick around when you roast longer, and they are responsible for the deeper, richer flavors in coffee. The acids tend to be more variable as well, so in general, the longer you roast, the more consistent the coffee becomes because you remove more of the acids. However, you also sacrifice the acid flavor. “Light” coffees are very popular in specialty coffee circles these days because they are such a unique experience – you can have a different experience with the same bean from the same roaster, just due to slight variations in the roasting process. Starbucks tends to roast their coffee hotter and shorter than small independent roasters – that is, their roast curve is sharper than Jesse’s where he may roast twice as long. For Starbucks, this helps produce a more consistent result (which is important for a company that has many thousands of stores serving the same thing). They also use cheaper beans which lack aroma and flavor, to begin with.![Conduit Coffee Studio](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/conduit-roasting-studio.Byj2wpaN_Z2tNQnM.webp) How the coffee is going to be prepared can have an impact on how it is roasted. This is where espresso blends come into play. The way espresso is prepared is by forcing water through very finely ground coffee – typically at 125 PSI, just short of boiling, over a short period of time (perhaps 30 seconds). The short amount of extraction time means that the coffee bean’s lipids don’t have time to come out. So when you have a short extraction time in espresso, what often happens is that many more acids come out of the coffee than lipids, and that is often why espresso is so bright and punchy. However, roasters can try to compensate for this by preparing coffees that are specially made with this preparation in mind. The exact process is again down to more of an art than a science, but basically, the longer you roast a coffee, the more acids you remove. So, a roaster may take a coffee and roast it a bit longer to remove some of that punch, and then blend that darker roast back in with a lighter roast to get a more balanced flavor (since roasting it longer also results in some loss of flavor). You get an espresso that is perhaps more balanced than if you were to use a lightly roasted coffee. You can, of course, use any coffee in an espresso, but due to the way that the coffee is ‘extracted’, you get a different flavor experience. This is also why coffee prepared in full immersion is such a different experience from coffee that is dripped. Drip coffee will have more of those acids and fewer lipids, so it will likely result in a brighter (or perhaps a more bitter?) cup of coffee – compared to if you use a French Press where the coffee is fully immersed for a couple of minutes, allowing time for the lipids to come out and give you a more rounded cup of coffee. One of the really cool things about roasting coffee is that there is such fluid control over the roasting process by the roaster. This is really where the art comes in. You start off with all the scientific knowledge that you can, but then your specific circumstances – the bean you are using, the atmosphere – all have an effect so when figuring out a roast for the first time you will likely need to fine tune it.![Roaster cooling](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/roaster-cooling.x6vdeqev_ZQTpEw.webp) With Jesse’s roaster, the mechanism pulls air from the room into the machine. It also uses gas for heat. So Jesse has fluid control over the airflow within the machine, as well as the gas flow in controlling the heat. This setup also means that the temperature of the room comes into play, and also explains why Jesse treats his roasting room like it is all one big roasting machine. While he can’t control the seasonal temperature, he has taken measures to have consistent control over the room temperature. When trying to figure out a new bean, there is experimentation that goes on – but often Jesse will start with a roasting profile for a similar bean, and then make adjustments from there, test roasting in smaller batches. He showed me a new coffee he has been working on, where he made slight adjustments to the roasting curve. I smelled both samples, and there was a distinct difference – though I honestly couldn’t put my finger on exactly what it was, only that they clearly had a different aroma. The only difference between the two roasting processes was that, in one, he had a different starting temperature of 5 degrees F, and I believe he also had a few seconds longer in the roaster. These are seemingly tiny differences, but they resulted in a HUGE change on the other end (huge, meaning you could definitely tell that the coffees were different). This also means that when the seasons change, because of the impact of the air in the space around the roaster, Jesse needs to rework his roasting profiles. If the starting temperature in the room is 20 degrees warmer – and thus the air going into the roaster is 20 degrees warmer – you can see how that would have a big impact on the end result. At the end of my visit, Jesse prepared for me that new roast he had been working on – a Bolivia. It was prepared in a French press – very simple. As we chatted and I stood there drinking the coffee, I was excited to find different flavors hiding in the cup. At first, perhaps it was a little hot, but as I took a few more sips, I discovered some very enjoyable fruit-like flavors, as well as a very smooth cup of coffee. One of the joys of discovering these well-made cups of coffee is that there is often no bitterness – or if there is, it’s part of a flavor (like how citrus might be a little bitter).![Conduit Coffee Bags of Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/conduit-coffee-whole-beans.CfoiOt2n_Z2iw9s3.webp) After enjoying that cup of coffee, Jesse took me over to the bag that the coffee came from and gave me the opportunity to smell the fresh green coffee that I had just enjoyed roasted. I was struck by how much it smelled like how it tasted. I regret my ability to describe coffee is limited – all I can say is that it was a joy to experience that fresh grown aroma and connect it with the well-crafted cup of coffee I had just enjoyed. Roasting is an art. Just as there are so many different types of coffee, there are many different styles of coffee roasting – and I believe the personality of the roaster can come out in their coffee. Jesse takes a very artistically crafted approach to his coffee – with great intent and care – and that shows in the end._This article first appeared in Extracted Magazine._### Resources [Conduit Coffee Company](https://www.conduitcoffee.com/) – Seattle-based coffee roaster.

# Russell Hobbs High Speed Coffee Grinder [Grinding Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/grinding-coffee/)---by [Ian Balchin](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/ian-balchin/)![Russell Hobbs High Speed Coffee Grinder](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/russell-hobbs-high-speed-coffee-grinder/russell-hobbs-2.jpeg)_The Russell Hobbs coffee grinder is not for sale in the USA. It is sold in South Africa. The dollar amounts in the article are in South African Rand (ZAR)._ There are lots of articles comparing the different sorts of grinders. Inevitably they end up recommending that we buy a slow-speed burr grinder. Unfortunately, these are expensive items to buy on a South African third-world budget. I was amazed to see an affordable but unusual-looking coffee grinder on the local supermarket shelves, especially in my home town proverbially 1000 miles up a 2000-mile dirt road. Closer inspection revealed that it was not a blade grinder and, thus, should be a burr grinder. I decided to buy this as in any case, it comes with a 1-year supermarket guarantee. Just as a price comparison: - Bosch rotary blade grinder local at around $30 (non-Bosch much less) - Rancilio Rocky on Amazon at $340 (heaven knows how much locally) - My ‘Russell Hobbs’ high-speed grinder local at around $45 This is a noisy, messy piece of equipment, but it is much better than the old blade grinder. It delivers a consistent-sized grind, stands on its own, and has some good and infuriating features.![RH Grinder](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/russell-hobbs-1-650x487.CQDcJi37_RNAjb.webp)_Coffee grinder parts out of the box._ The bean hopper is on the left, the grinder proper is in the middle, and the ground coffee receiver is on the right. The bean hopper is marked with a ‘max’ level indicator that is less than halfway up to the top. I regularly operate it much fuller than that with no ill effects. This snaps into the top of the grinder properly. The ground coffee receiver fits onto the right over a rubber outlet on the side of the grinder properly. This is a source of leaking coffee, particularly when removing the receiver. I find it necessary to remove the lid first, use the back end of a teaspoon to remove grinds at the edge of the rubber outlet, and give it a good whack with the spoon to ensure everything drops down into the receiver.![Coffee grinder control panel](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/russell-hobbs-2-487x650.CW3eO-kS_Z45cj5.webp)_Coffee grinder control panel._ The large black knob lets you dial up to 6 cups worth of grinds. The graduations are approximate. This controls an electronic timer. Bearing in mind the size of the receiver and the adhesive notice warning you not to run the unit for longer than 100 seconds at a time, I have no idea whether you should use the higher settings, and in the event that you do where all that coffee would go. The small black push button above the larger dial is pushed to start the grinding cycle. This is conveniently positioned so that if you hold it, depressing it, and having foolishly left the grinder plugged in, it will run. If the receiver is not attached you could have a lot of coffee all around you as it comes out at a really good rate. Fortunately, a second touch will stop the machine. You will see above the push-button some markings like ‘Medium’ and ‘Coarse’. With that set halfway between ‘Medium’ and ‘Fine,’ the grind is amply fine enough to suit my espresso machine. That black ring around the bottom of the bean hopper is turned to set the type of grind that you need. Do not do this while the unit is plugged in.![inside bean hopper](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/russell-hobbs-3-650x487.CezZLmHk_Z1GgOuJ.webp)_Inside of the bean hopper and the bean distributing central cone._![coffee grinder output](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/russell-hobbs-4-650x487.DDYlVI69_Z2q1ADi.webp) The photo above shows the unit operating with a strong output of ground coffee. The unit generates a lot of static electricity as it runs. It is best to grind beans some short while before you need the coffee to allow the static to leak away from the insulating plastic receiver. This ensures you can remove coffee effectively from in and around the spout before removing the receiver – thus lessening the mess. I don’t know about Chinese wiring standards (because, like everything else, it is ‘made in China’), but the unit is always warm. I suspect the electronic timer is wired before the switch and is always on. So, another reason is not to leave it plugged in. So maybe a Rocky will be next, but in the meantime, this little unit is messily and noisily but efficiently grinding my coffee. Don’t be put off by the push to a slow-speed direct drive grinder that perhaps you can’t afford. As with everything else, a little compromise can get you on the road quicker. ### Resources [Choosing the Right Coffee Grinder](https://ineedcoffee.com/choosing-the-right-coffee-grinder/) – INeedCoffee article by Malcolm Pang.

# Roasting Coffee in a Popcorn Popper [Roasting Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/roasting-coffee/)---by [Michael Allen Smith](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/michael-allen-smith/)![Roasting Coffee in a Popcorn Popper](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/roasting-coffee-in-a-popcorn-popper/roasting-coffee-in-a-popcorn-popper.jpg) The conversation always starts the same way. While sharing some freshly brewed coffee with a neighbor or co-worker, the topic of roasting coffee at home comes up. Most have no knowledge of the topic, and they ask how it’s done. At this point, I start listing the various methods of home coffee roasting. Recently, I was stopped in mid-sentence as I began a high-level overview of the various roasting methods. The interested party looked at me and asked point-blank to tell him EXACTLY how I roasted the coffee he was enjoying. There are many different variations for roasting coffee in a popcorn popper, but in this article, I will describe EXACTLY the steps I use for my favorite method of home coffee roasting – the original West Bend Poppery.![West Bend Poppery.](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/westbend-the-poppery.BuLpKUEG_1eFQEw.webp)_The West Bend Poppery. Excellent for home roasting coffee._### What I Use - 1500 Watt West Bend Poppery (no substitutions) - empty soup can or fitted dryer vent - wooden spoon with a long handle - Salter kitchen scale (I roast by weight, not volume) - 2 metal colanders - plastic Tupperware bottom - green coffee beans (use your favorite search engine to find them) - A stack of Post-It notes - black marker - air-tight container - broom or Black and Decker DustBuster![1500 watts - Poppery Popcorn Popper](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/watts350.CFJeRq2E_1ssdXx.webp)_Underneath the West Bend Poppery is a plate showing the wattage. Look for 1500 watts._### Roasting Preparations Roasting coffee in a popcorn popper is not an indoor endeavor. Without modifications, you would fill your home with smoke. The first step is to find a spot outside near an outlet. It will produce smoke, so keep it away from open windows. If your popper has one of those plastic lids, remove it and set it aside. The next thing you need to do is prep the soup can. Open both ends of the can and clean it. You’ll be using the can as a chimney, so make sure it can fit snugly into the top of the popper. ### Why use the West Bend Poppery? Several popcorn poppers will do a good job roasting coffee. In my opinion, the best one is the original 1500-Watt West Bend Poppery. This is not the same roaster as the West Bend Poppery 2, which was smaller and had less wattage. The only way to acquire an original Poppery is through _eBay_ or yard sales. At one point, I owned 5 of them and paid an average of $40 per unit. As a popcorn popper that’s too expensive, but as a coffee roaster, it’s a bargain. The West Bend Poppery is built like a tank. I’ve never had a single failure. Note that when buying a West Bend Poppery through the mail, it’s possible that the front lip was snapped off if the unit was poorly packed. This is not a major concern since the lid is not used. Using a product called _Gorilla Glue_ will restore your unit. ### Reasons to NOT use the West Bend Poppery As much as I prefer the West Bend Poppery for most of my roasting, there are real reasons why this may not be the roaster for you. The first reason is that it is an outdoor roaster that doesn’t like colder weather. When I say it doesn’t like colder weather, I mostly refer to the first roast. On cold days, the first roast can take an extra 3-4 minutes. The result is the beans sound done (well into the 2nd crack), but visually they look light. The taste is a little flat. Subsequent roasts tend to roast quicker and taste better. There are [cold weather tricks](https://ineedcoffee.com/cold-weather-coffee-roasting/), however, my advice is for beginners to learn the Poppery during nice weather. I even put my Poppery away during the winter and use a countertop roaster. ### Step By Step Roasting Turn on the machine. As you prepare the roast, it’s good to get the machine warmed up. Measure out the beans. Place the Tupperware bottom on your kitchen scale and zero out the reading. From here, you will place between 100 and 150 grams of green coffee in the Tupperware. How much coffee you use depends on the size of the bean and the type of home roaster you have. Use the following chart to calculate the bean weight. Bean Size Hands Off Roaster Hands-On Roaster Big (Nicaragua “elephant bean”) 100-105 grams 110-115 grams Normal (90% of beans) 120-130 grams 125-135 grams Small (Peaberries) 130-135 grams 140-150 grams It should be noted that there is technically no such thing as _hands-off_ coffee roasting. Roasting coffee in a popcorn popper does require constant attention. _Hands-off in the above chart refers to the amount of work needed_ to produce excellent coffee. In short, more coffee equals more work. Leaving a roast unattended is [never a good idea](https://ineedcoffee.com/melitta-mishap/ "Melitta Mishap").![kitchen scale](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/weigh-coffee-beans.DyxIv-QZ_Z2oPBg0.webp)_Use a kitchen scale to weigh the green coffee beans._ Pour the beans slowly into the popper. When beans first go into a popper, you can observe three possible behaviors. 1. The beans spin in a circle. This means you can probably add a little more coffee to the roast. Failure to add more can result in more initial airflow and extend the roast time. Extending the roast too long will bake the beans and yield a flat taste. 2. The beans dance in a random pattern. You placed a perfect amount in the popper. 3. The beans aren’t moving. For a hand-off roaster, this means you added too much coffee. For a hands-on roaster, this means it’s your job to keep the beans moving during the first few minutes of the roast. Using your wooden spoon, stir the beans for 5 seconds every 15 seconds. Gradually, the beans will get lighter due to the roasting process, and they will be able to move independently. Until then, your goal is to keep beans from getting stuck touching the popper heating element. Beans can burn in less than a minute. Based on the above behaviors, I advise those new to popper roasting to use fewer beans. As you gradually gain experience and confidence, you can add more beans. I once roasted 160 grams of Colombian Peaberry without burning any beans. [Popcorn Popper Home Coffee Roast Start](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6B6XjHN42rw) (YouTube 23 seconds)_The video above shows approximately how full the popper will be at the start of a “hands-off” roast._ Although stirring is required when overfilling the popper, I always stir to release the chaff. When coffee roasts, the skin from the bean comes off. This skin is called chaff. Before the roast is finished, the chaff needs to be removed. It can be removed during the roast or after the roast. It’s easier to do during the roast. Once the chaff starts to come off, using the wooden spoon you can agitate the beans to release the chaff, which will come out the top of the popper. It should be noted that decaf beans do not have chaff and roast faster. As the beans roast, they will get lighter. Some could jump out of the popper as they get lighter and start jumping. Place your open-ended soup can on the top of the roaster to prevent this possibility. This will keep all the beans in the roaster. Now that the beans are roasting, our next step is determining when to stop the roast. There are two common methods of roasting. One is by sight and one is by sound. Experienced home roasters typically roast with both, with the sound being more important. New home roasters favor sight. Determining the sweet spot to stop a particular roast is a never-ending process, so this article won’t cover it. However, I can advise beginners to use beans that taste good when lightly or darkly roasted. Beans that I feel taste good at different degrees of roasting are Colombian, Guatemalan, and Sumatran. Don’t practice with island beans or those less forgiving to being over-roasted like most African varietals.![roast color 1](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/roast-color-1.CUMDEmE3_Z19yztP.webp)![roast color 2](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/roast-color-2.CpjYTRRC_1pY4Og.webp)![roast color 3](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/roast-color-3.ZLRcMvUB_Zm915M.webp)![roast color 4](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/roast-color-4.SryrDm-D_gzrSN.webp)_The four photos above show a roast color progression._[Popcorn Popper Coffee Roast Finish 2nd crack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejPLCgyzJYE) (YouTube 21 seconds)_In this video, you can hear the start of the 2nd crack. At this point, I usually stop the roast._### Stopping The Roast Hit the off switch on the popper. Using the wooden spoon, gently knock the soup can chimney off the popper. You don’t want to grab the soup can, as it is very hot. Pour the beans into one of your two metal colanders. Your goal now is to –quickly– bring the coffee down to room temperature. Failure to do so will cause the beans to continue roasting, which could lead to over-roasting and burning. On most days, simply pouring the coffee from one colander to another for a few minutes is enough. I try to face any wind to accelerate this cooling. You may wish to use the water bottle method on hot days with no airflow.![cool the beans](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/cooling-coffee-beans.5d3plUYc_2iBUgj.webp)_Move the coffee back and forth between the two colanders to quickly cool the beans._ After the beans have cooled, they should be stored properly in an airtight container. Don’t put them in the freezer; [keep them out of the refrigerator](https://ineedcoffee.com/coffee-storage/). Keep your container at room temperature. Take out a Post-It note and write the name of the bean and the date you roasted it. Coffee is a perishable item. The darker you roast, the faster the beans will go stale. I tend to roast on the lighter side, so my beans are still fresh 10-14 days off roast. If I roasted dark, I would try to use up my coffee in the first week. The date label reminds us to throw those beans away if they get too old. If you find yourself throwing too much away, roast less.![label coffee roast](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/label350.DOru2RFr_Z2fKRDs.webp)_Adding a dated Post-It note to your coffee storage container is a good habit to develop._### Clean Up Roasting coffee in a popcorn popper will produce chaff. You’ve probably got a mess of chaff around your popper right now. Some beans produce a lot of chaff (Brazil), whereas decaf has none. At this point, grab your broom or DustBuster and clean it up. I usually let my popper cool for a few minutes before storing it. ### Ready To Drink? Except for decaf, coffee is not ready to drink immediately after roasting. There needs to be a period of degassing and that period will vary from bean to bean. Some beans require more time to settle than others. Although each bean is unique, I have generally found that 1-3 days is enough rest before brewing. Not for peak brewing time, but for the earliest time to drink. Dark roasts and decaf will be ready sooner than light roasts. ### Advanced Topics This article does not cover advanced topics such as hardware modification or indoor ventilation. The Poppery can be modified to perform its cooling. I have a modified unit. However, I prefer to cool beans by hand. While one batch is cooling, I’m roasting a second. And since I live in Southern California, I have little reason to roast inside most of the year. ### Conclusion Roasting coffee at home is highly rewarding. One of the benefits of learning to roast with a West Bend Poppery is that, unlike many of today’s countertop roasters, which are extremely loud, this roaster allows you to hear the roast. The quiet nature of the Poppery puts your auditory focus on the roast and not the engine doing the roast. And finally, the Poppery allows the home roaster to make some delicious coffee for a very little initial investment. ### Resources [Roast Your Own](https://ineedcoffee.com/roast-your-own-coffee/) – Our original popper article uses the Poppery 2, but the rules are the same.

# Roasting Coffee in a Frying Pan [Roasting Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/roasting-coffee/)---by [Heidi Tadesse](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/heidi-tadesse/)![Roasting Coffee in a Frying Pan](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/roasting-coffee-in-a-frying-pan/roast11.jpg) When I home roast coffee, I use a big frying pan. I buy my green coffee beans from different parts of the world and then deliver the roasted coffee each day to some of my clients. ### Equipment Needed - Large frying pan - Long spoon reserved for just roasting coffee - Gas stove - Spray bottle with fine mist setting - Tray for cooling beans ### Procedure The way I roast coffee is very simple. Place the frying pan on the stove and use a temperature of at least 350F. Add the green coffee beans to the pan. Use the spoon by moving the beans around constantly from top to bottom. Doing this will prevent the beans from burning.![Pan Roasting Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/roast11.2G_snVW6_Q5bdx.webp)_Pan Roasting Coffee_ Roast as light or as dark as you like. The picture below shows beans roasted at 8 minutes (top), 12 minutes (bottom right), and 15 minutes (bottom left).![Coffee Roasts Completed](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/roast-done.BU052eI__1Fs5TU.webp)_Coffee Roasts Completed_### Ventilation Roasting coffee does produce smoke. The darker you roast, the more smoke. Make sure you have ventilation fans on and, in some cases, the windows open. If you have a sensitive smoke detector, you may wish to disable it during the roasting process. Just be sure to turn it back on afterward. Not every kitchen will be set up to remove the smoke produced by indoor coffee roasting. Use a smaller batch of coffee on your first roast. ### Cooling the Beans When the beans have roasted as dark as you like, it is now time to cool the beans. Turn off the stove and then [spray a fine mist of cold water](https://ineedcoffee.com/popper-roasting-tips/) on top of the coffee beans. The water should immediately evaporate. Now, transfer the beans to your cooling tray. Place the cooling tray in an area that will allow it to cool quickly, such as near an open window in the kitchen.![Serve Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/pour450.BDC8dyit_27aXz4.webp)_Serve Coffee_### Resources [Home Roasting Coffee in an Oven](https://ineedcoffee.com/home-roasting-coffee-in-an-oven/) – This tutorial covers listening to the roast as well as advice on cooling the beans quickly.

Published on December 17, 2014--- #### Heidi Tadesse I am originally from Ethiopia. When I was younger my parents had a coffee tree in the back of the house. When ripe the coffee beans have a beautiful reddish color and a sweet taste. We would pick the beans and dry it in the sun (depending on the weather it could take weeks to dry). As the beans dried, the color and the size of the bean changes; they became smaller and darker. From a very young age I watched my mother preparing the coffee ceremony every day in the morning. She would invite all her neighbours and prepare little snacks. Everyone would talk about what had happened the night before and share their dreams. The ceremony lasts over two hours and can include a fortune-telling reading of the coffee grounds. The first time I roasted coffee I was 10 years. I was fascinated how the simplest thing (coffee) brought a big gathering in my mother’s house every day.

# Roasting Coffee with a Heat Gun: A Top-Down Approach [Roasting Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/roasting-coffee/)---by [Jim Liedeka](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/jim-liedeka/)![Roasting Coffee with a Heat Gun: A Top-Down Approach](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/roasting-coffee-with-a-heat-gun-a-top-down-approach/hg_roastarea1.jpg) I first learned to roast coffee with the _FreshRoast Plus_. There are a lot of advantages to small purpose-built roasting appliances. I still recommend them to beginners. A desire to improve the roasting process led me through various phases of experimentation. By [adding a variac](https://ineedcoffee.com/roasting-with-a-variac-controlled-freshroast-plus/ "Roasting with a Variac Controlled FreshRoast Plus") I was able to achieve an amazing level of control over the profile. After a while, however, I found I was spending too much time roasting due to the small batch sizes. There are other home coffee roasting methods suited to larger batches. I tried a stovetop popper, which worked well, but the popper I got wasn’t very durable. I decided to try the heat gun, figuring if it didn’t work, a heat gun would still be useful. It turns out the heat gun is a viable way to roast up to a pound or so of green beans. The following is a how-to based on my experience. ### The Equipment To get started, you need a heat gun, a vessel to contain the beans, and a stirring utensil. I use the Wagner HT775 heat gun, which is commonly available at hardware and home improvement stores. My current roasting vessel is a stainless mesh colander inside a metal mixing bowl. A large metal spoon serves as my stirring implement.![Home coffee Roasting Area](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/hg_roastarea1.mCASxOOz_1rKCKq.webp)_Home coffee Roasting Area_ Michael Lloyd’s excellent primer provides a more comprehensive discussion of heat gun and roasting vessel choices. The primer is on Ed Needham’s home roasting site (June 2022: site offline). You can also see many discussion threads on _CoffeeGeek_ and alt.coffee. The early pioneers used stainless steel dog bowls to roast in. You may, in fact, hear heat gun roasting referred to as the dog bowl method. They are still the most common roasting vessels. ### The Method Roasting with a heat gun is another variation of the fluid bed method used in most home roasting appliances. I’m told a Sivetz sample roaster actually uses a heat gun to blow air up through beans held in a metal tube. The method I’m going to talk about is throwing some beans into a bowl and blasting them with a heat gun. It sounds like something you would see on Tool Time, but it really works. - Choose a suitable roasting site. Due to chaff and smoke volume, I recommend doing this outdoors. The wind is the enemy. So is rain, for that matter. Earthquakes may help agitate the beans. - Put one pound of green beans (about three cups by volume) into a bowl or colander that holds at least two quarts. If the bowl is too small, vigorous stirring can send the beans into orbit. The colander-in-bowl method traps hot air below the beans. The jury is still out on what this means. - Preheat the gun for a minute or so. This also helps to clear out any dust or flaming cinders from the chaff. (Important safety tip: chaff that gets sucked into the heat gun may catch fire. Be mindful of anything flammable in the vicinity.) - Start with the lowest heat setting and the nozzle about one inch above the beans. - Move the heat gun in circles while stirring the beans. You can also vary the height above the beans. Stirring is crucial for even heat distribution. - Watch the beans for evenness of color. Adjust stirring or gun position as needed. - When the green color has disappeared you can increase the heat to drive 1st crack. If you just keep doing what you are doing, you will get 1st crack after about 10 to 11 minutes. - Depending on what sort of roast you are going for, you may want to back off the heat once 1st crack gets rolling. This batch size limits your profiling options. 2nd crack can start before 1st has finished. - When you reach your desired roast level, cool the beans using whatever technique you like. I use two mesh colanders and pour the beans from one to the other. That works best when it’s cool and breezy. For summer roasting, I’ll probably add water quenching to speed up the cooling. That’s really all there is to it. It’s a surprisingly cheap and convenient way to roast a pound of coffee. ### Additional Notes Home roasters like me are always looking for ways to improve the quality or quantity of the roast. The technique is a moving target since we learn something new from every batch. Environmental conditions also play a role. My experience involves five months of roasting outside through fall and winter in the Midwest. Your mileage may vary. The choice of mesh strainers is about minimizing heat being conducted away from the beans. Other approaches might be to use an insulated roasting vessel or a supplemental heat source to mitigate the effect. The mixing bowl underneath traps heat. I measured this with a thermocouple. I suspect this adds stability to the temperature but don’t have enough data. Flaming chaff is a real issue. It generally burns out pretty quickly, but you wouldn’t want someone to fuel up a lawn mower three feet away. It’s generally not an issue for roast quality. I have yet to find a satisfactory way to measure bean temperatures directly. The readings were inconsistent because it’s hard to keep the thermocouple in the bean mass while stirring. Putting the thermocouple below the colander helps a little. Without the benefit of temperature readings, you have to use your senses more. You can learn a lot from the smell. If you roast many different varieties, you’ll notice that some beans roast darker than others without being any more done. (i.e., darker at lower bean temperatures) When you are trying to stop before the second crack, the smell is the best guide. Your eyes can really trick you, especially on the light end.![Heat Gun Coffee Roast](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/hg_prys_city.5zZubi4Q_Z1f874m.webp)_Completed Heat Gun Coffee Roast_### Questions and Answers_I looked online at the different heat guns. They all seem to have a different variable temperature range. When purchasing a heat gun, what temperature range should I look for?_ The model I use ranges from 500-750F. Some go higher. Another part of the equation is the CFM rating of the blower. Some heat guns put out plenty of heat but they can never get to the beans. I heard about one that had a ridiculously high airflow that blew the beans right out of the bowl. The best we’ve been able to come up with is a minimum of 500F and 14CFM. For a hotter gun, hold it farther away from the beans._What temperature do you set your heat gun at when roasting? You mention in the article using the “lowest heat setting”, but that seems to vary from gun to gun. How do you alter that temperature once the roasting begins?_ I start at 500F and kick it up to 750F to push 1st crack along. Otherwise, it basically stays at 500F. Heat is controlled by controlling the airflow. The fastest speed is the lowest heat setting. There isn’t a huge range of movement from one to the other. It’s just a dial on the side._When roasting less than a pound, I’m assuming the roast goes faster. Do you reduce the temperature to adjust for small batches? If so, do you have any guidelines?_ A one-cup batch usually reaches 1st crack around 7-8 minutes. I haven’t used the higher heat setting with small batches. Basically, you control the roast by how close the heat is to the beans. If I wanted to slow down a smaller batch, I’d back the heat gun off somewhat._Are there any safety concerns when using a heat gun? Are goggles or gloves necessary?_ Gloves may be desirable due to the heat coming off the beans, especially later in the roast. I don’t use gloves unless it’s cold out. Mainly just keep in mind that really hot air is coming out of the heat gun and not to grab the nozzle or anything like that. An oven mitt or similar can be useful immediately after the roast because the bowl is pretty hot. It actually depends on where you grab the bowl. ### Conclusion Someone once said all you need to roast coffee are beans and a heat source. The heat gun method makes an excellent heat source. It allows for a good range of batch sizes and is at least an order of magnitude cheaper than most drum roasters. It’s probably not for everyone, but anyone can do it. ### Resources [Why Home Roast Coffee?](https://ineedcoffee.com/why-home-roast/) – INeedCoffee article.

# Roasting Coffee to the “Rate of Rise Kick” [Roasting Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/roasting-coffee/)---by [Sam Hampton](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/sam-hampton/)![Roasting Coffee to the “Rate of Rise Kick”](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/roasting-coffee-to-the-rate-of-rise-kick/rate-of-rise-kick.jpg) Several articles in the past few months that I encountered centered on the importance of ROR (rate of rise) when roasting coffee. After reading just one it was like eating potato chips, l could not stop. Over the past few months, I started comparing my data on ROR with what I was finding online. I still roast in the perfect roasting apparatus, a converted [bread machine using a heat gun](https://ineedcoffee.com/corretto-home-roasting/). I added two switches and a temperature probe at a cost of fewer than twenty dollars to a bread machine I picked up at a thrift store for $3.50. It took about an hour to convert and that was about two and a half years ago and many happy roasts since. I started Googling ROR and looking at the ROR Image lines on roasting charts. I did this for temperature curves several years before when looking at the roasting temperature, but did not focus on the ROR output lines at that time. This time, I noticed one thing right off the bat when comparing my ROR lines with other ROR chart lines I found online. For the most part, the chart lines on most of the charts were a squiggle of descending lines, which to me were meaningless. I could only see the **Natural Roasting Profile**, which allows the ROR to drop as the coffee beans lose moisture and dry out when roasting. The drier the bean gets, the less heat it can absorb. This is a descending endothermic process that all roasting coffee beans exhibit when roasted. This continues from the start of roasting to the point where the first crack ends. Most of the free moisture is lost in the first three minutes of roasting up to the point of 100 °C (212°F). Then deeper internal free moisture is started to be removed during the Maillard process from 130 °C to 170 °C. This is evidenced by the changes in the color of the beans from green to yellow and then brown. The final free moisture is removed in the development stage up to and through the end of the first crack of the roasting process. The beans have been roasted at this point to a city plus or full city level. This is the point where the beans stop being endothermic and become exothermic. This is easily reasoned and documented by keeping good data during the roast. The reason this does not show up clearly on most roasting charts is that there is too much data being processed. ROR by the minute does not need a fancy algorithm or complicated math to be determined. ROR is the difference in the bean temperature from the last minute to the next minute by simple subtraction. Heat transfer can be documented by anyone with a hot cast iron skillet and a pot holder. If the pot holder is wet, the hand will let you know very quickly that the heat transfer is quicker when there is moisture present in the pot holder. A dry potholder can safely pick up the skillet. Coffee beans, when they contain a lot of moisture, can react to absorb heat and thus evaporate that moisture. As the beans dry out, they lose the ability to evaporate the moisture. This is the **Natural Roasting Profile**. There is a definite point in the ROR chart line that shows when the process changes from endothermic to exothermic. I call it the “kick.” If a simple data set is kept of the ROR temperatures by the minute, the ROR will stop falling and start increasing. This can be seen plainly when the roasting heat and other roasting factors are held constant; the ROR will jump on its own. The charts below show clearly the “kick”.![Chart 1 - Rate of Return](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/chart1-rate-of-return.CIdAp1Q9_2jFbq9.webp)_Chart 1_![Chart 2 - Rate of Return](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/chart-2-rate-of-return.-BcDCpZC_ZSGpMX.webp)_Chart 2_ This same “kick” can be seen on many of the roasting charts online, even with an overabundance of data and manipulation of heat and other roasting factors. I can monitor my roasts by manually recording temperature by the minute and calculating ROR in my head. I roast only Kenyan AA and Ethiopian dry-process beans. I use a heat gun to provide the temperature and air. I use a router control to make minor adjustments to the heat and air during the roast, and I reduce or increase heat to create the roast profile, switching from high to low depending on how quickly the beans dry out. The profiles do not have a lot of variance, and this gives me consistent results. Roasting to the “Kick” gives me a way of knowing that I have roasted to my desired roast level, which I check and confirm by weight.![Chart 3 - Rate of Return](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/chart-3-rate-of-return.kE7oM4w4_8p3ml.webp)_Chart 3_ The data above is the entry section of the _New Minute Green Bean Logger_ template chart for the Excel spreadsheet program. Temperature data is recorded manually during roasting and entered into the spreadsheet for archive and analysis. Temperature is entered into columns 1 to 4, and the ROR data is automatically calculated from the temperature data. In this roast, batch 2 was pulled before the kick occurred. Batch 3 was pulled when the temperature reached 217 °C, when the kick was observed. An unchanging reduced heat gun setting was maintained from 2 minutes to the end of the roast._The Green Bean Logger_ is a free spreadsheet template I created for Microsoft Excel. It is not free-standing; it is only a template, and a copy of Excel is needed to use it. For your reference, below is a screenshot of the _New Minute Green Bean Coffee Logger_ template.

# Scotch Coffee [Recipes](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/coffee-recipes/)---by [Steve Gaythorpe](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/steve-gaythorpe/)![Scotch Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/scotch-coffee/scotch-coffee1.jpg) Why is it that when we add whisky to coffee we use Irish whiskey, never Scotch whisky? I discovered recently that, historically, ‘Scotch Coffee’ had nothing to do with whisky or coffee. Scotch Coffee was drunk in times of hardship when supplies of coffee had run out. It consisted of hot water, milk, sugar, and a handful of burnt breadcrumbs. This foul concoction was “popular” from the time coffee was first introduced into the UK. The name is, obviously, derived from the supposed tight-fistedness of the Scots. I would like to reclaim “Scotch Coffee”, and the honour of the Scots. The Irish may have invented whisky (that’s going to upset some people) but the Scots perfected the art of making it. Also, Scotch whisky regions are so varied that the potential exists for a unique coffee experience with every mug.![Scotch Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/scotch-coffee1.BfQDJ1hR_nb1ma.webp)_Scotch Coffee_### Scotch Coffee Ingredients - A mug - A shot of espresso - A shot of your favourite single malt Scotch whisky (e.g., Highland Park) - Sugar (if desired) - Milk – to steam and froth ### Directions 1.

# Roasting with a Variac Controlled FreshRoast Plus [Roasting Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/roasting-coffee/)---by [Jim Liedeka](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/jim-liedeka/)![Roasting with a Variac Controlled FreshRoast Plus](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/roasting-with-a-variac-controlled-freshroast-plus/variac1.jpg) I began my adventure with coffee roasting last winter when I received a FreshRoast Plus for Christmas. The FreshRoast is known for being a bit fast but it is an excellent machine to learn with and is relatively quiet. The FR also has the advantage of being modifiable. Most modifications are an effort to slow the roast down. Some examples are extending the roast chamber height with a Campbell’s soup can, propping up one side of the roaster with a coin or shim, adding a thermometer or heat probe, and changing the airflow. An excellent approach is to control the voltage going into the unit to vary the temperature. That’s where the variac comes in. ### What is a variac? A variac is a voltage control device normally used in industrial applications. The model I will be discussing is the KRM 5 amp variac from The Coffee Bean Corral, over fused with a 20 amp fuse. It has a big dial on top that lets you select any voltage from 0 to 130 volts. It provides this voltage through a grounded outlet. See the right side of the attached photo.![Variac](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/variac1.CwCi9zsh_Z9bUOm.webp)_Variac_ There have been safety concerns raised about over fusing a variac. Over fusing is necessary because the five amp fuse would burn out trying to drive a 15 amp roaster. For home roasting purposes, the KRM model can handle the load. However, be advised that over-fusing may have risks including shock or electrical fires, and should be done at your own risk. Also, use of the variac will likely void the roaster’s warranty, and putting a 20 amp fuse in the variac will likely void its warranty. In other words, this article is for informational purposes only. The variac can be used alone or with other electrical modifications. Some people have separated the fan from the heating element and used two variacs. This allows you to keep the fan speed up while lowering the heat or vice-versa. — You can see some discussion of this on the Sweet Maria’s homeroast list, the Coffee Geek website, and the alt.coffee newsgroup. — My approach is to work with just the variac and a thermometer. It’s good to have at least one spare roasting chamber if you roast several batches in a session. ### The Procedure Typically I roast from four to six batches in a session. The roast type I use varies with the bean or blend I am roasting. For the purposes of this article, I will describe a moderately dark roast — early second crack. This roast is suitable for some East African coffees like Kenya AA and Ethiopian Harar among others. Lighter roasts for Bourbon beans like Galapagos Islands, Puerto Rico Yauco, and others are trickier. I’ll say more about this later. Start with two slightly underfilled scoops of green beans. This is slightly less than the two rounded scoops recommended by Sweet Maria’s. The difference is that reducing the voltage also reduces the fan speed. A slightly smaller batch size gives better control. Half the battle is roasting the beans evenly so the inside of the bean is fully developed. - Start the roaster with the variac set to 115 volts. We want to get the beans moving. This will minimize scorching. - When the beans begin moving well, slowly begin to lower the voltage. We want to ramp up to the first crack as slowly as possible. We also want the beans to be as even as possible before the first crack. - Keep note of the time and temperature. By the time the temperature reaches 250 to 300, usually in about a minute, rest the beans for 30 seconds by shutting the roaster all the way off. This allows the heat trapped by the beans to equalize a bit. - As the beans approach a tan to light brown color, give the beans another 30-second rest. Usually, this helps get the beans pretty close to even. - Before reaching the first crack, ease the voltage down to 105. With that and the two rest periods, it’s usually four or five minutes to the first crack. - As the first crack starts, briefly raise the voltage to 115 got 15 to 30 seconds. Then lower it to 100 for another 15 to 30 seconds. Then take it back to 105 through the end of the first crack. - After the first crack, lower the voltage to about 100. This will basically keep the temperature constant and allow the heat to penetrate to the core of the beans. You may want to watch the thermometer to be sure the temperature is stable to slowly climb. - After stretching out the roast for 3-5 minutes, raise the voltage to 115 volts. This will drive the second crack. - As the second crack gets going but before reaching the rolling stage, shut the roaster completely off for 45 to 60 seconds. This allows the beans to heat each other. It also allows flavor complexities to develop. - Then raise the voltage to one thirty and turn the roaster dial to cool. Two cooling cycles will lower the temperature to less than 175F. From there the beans can be cooled in a metal colander. Your mileage may vary when roasting with this procedure. Beans don’t like to follow scripts. Ambient temperature, pressure, and humidity can all affect the roasting process. You may also choose to stop the roast earlier or later than I do. For a lighter roast, I walk a finer line from the start. I try to balance keeping the beans moving with keeping the temperature lower. The idea is to bring the beans to the first crack as slowly as possible. As the beans approach the desired roast level, a brief blast at 115 volts for 30 to 60 seconds can preserve acidity and fruit flavors. A slower finish will help develop more body. Once you’ve done a few roasts like this, you will probably want to add your own refinements to the process. If you are inclined towards the technical approach to roasting, there is a lot of information on profiles posted on alt.coffee and the homeroast list. If you take a more intuitive approach, you may decide to lengthen or shorten different stages depending on how the beans look or smell. ### Conclusion Using the variac with the FreshRoast will lengthen the roast times. Seven to ten minutes per batch is a common range. That means it may take more than an hour to roast a half-pound. However, you can get coffee that is better than what you can buy. And there is just no substitute for fresh coffee. Published on May 27, 2003--- #### Jim Liedeka Jim Liedeka, a devotee of the bean, works with computers all day and appreciates the caffeine.

# Rookie Roast – Confessions of a First-Time Home Roaster [Roasting Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/roasting-coffee/)---by [Alex Scofield](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/alex-scofield/)![Rookie Roast – Confessions of a First-Time Home Roaster](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/rookie-roast-confessions-of-a-first-time-home-roaster/beans_roasted3.jpg) My coffee-drinking palate changed forever in early 2000. All in one mug I had my first taste of home-roasted coffee, as well as my first taste of French-pressed coffee. I won’t soon forget it. So rich, so intense, a one-of-a-kind taste. Within days, I bought a French press and began buying premium beans. I was convinced that the press was the brewing method that delivered a bean’s truest taste. For the past eight years, whenever I buy the good stuff, I brew it in the French press. But what about home-roasting? More than seven years passed before I gave it a shot. Is it strange that a coffee connoisseur who [writes](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/alex-scofield/) for a coffee website would go so long before attempting a home roast? Sure, but I had my excuses. For five of those years, I lived in a high-rise. Knowing that [indoor oven roasting](https://ineedcoffee.com/home-roasting-coffee-in-an-oven/) is a smoky process, I feared that roasting in my fifth-floor apartment would set off the smoke detector and send hundreds of neighbors running outside. On the eve of the summer solstice 2007, I was out of excuses. I lived in a townhouse, I had the beans, and I had the means of roasting them. I had detailed instructions on home-roasting courtesy of Sweet Maria’s and my INeedCoffee colleagues. The following is a diary of my first-ever attempt at roasting coffee beans. As things turned out, it served as an anti-tutorial. Learn from my mistakes, laugh at my expense, but don’t try it at home – or rather, **do** try roasting at home, just don’t try it the way I did it. Here goes … ### Prelude Many people play the lottery. I prefer going to the _Mayorga Coffee Roasters Warehouse_ in Rockville, Md. Mayorga is one of my favorite roasters, and they sell overruns of each week’s roasts at the Warehouse. You never know what kind of beans they have on any given week, but nearly all their beans are good, and there’s a discount on the pound bags. Mayorga also sells unroasted beans at this location. On this day, several types of beans are available, each $5/pound. A fan of many Ethiopian beans, I chose Ethiopian Yirgacheffe. I take my first look at unroasted coffee beans. They’re pale green, and I could just say they’re smaller than a typical roasted bean. They have a faint aroma, a bit like dried peas.![unroasted coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/beans_hand31.DS6lcUx5_sFOzA.webp)_I hold unroasted coffee beans for the first time._ So I have top-notch beans. This is good because, from this point forward, I break home-roasting rules in a near-criminal fashion. ### The Setup I’m too cheap to buy a real roaster, too mechanically impaired to [build my own roaster](https://ineedcoffee.com/building-your-own-coffee-roaster/), and too impatient to bid for a [Poppery](https://ineedcoffee.com/roasting-coffee-in-a-popcorn-popper/) on eBay. My rookie roasting effort will be in an electric wok. Years ago, a friend who moved out of town unloaded the wok on me. For cooking pad thai, it has served me well. How will it roast coffee? I have my doubts. Sweet Maria’s has a detailed [tutorial on wok-roasting](http://web.archive.org/web/20140806004941/http://www.sweetmarias.com:80/skilletmethod.php), but they give fair warning. “These methods are not uniformly successful,” says the Sweet Maria’s site. Specifically, on wok roasting, they say, it’s “better as an experiment.” The Sweet Maria’s instructions call for “any lightweight skillet with a good tight lid.” The lid to my wok is a bit warped; a tight seal will not be happening. Worse, the wok only goes up to 425 degrees Fahrenheit, and the Sweet Maria’s instructions call for 500-degree heat. But hey, what’s a degree Fahrenheit or two – or 75 – between friends? It’s a chilly day. I’m out of roasted coffee. I have an electric wok that only goes up to 425, and a lid that doesn’t fit. Hit it. ### Fire ’em Up**-10 minutes** — I plug the wok into an outdoor socket on my patio and preheat it, turning the dial to the maximum 425 degrees. I twist extra hard, in hopes that the dial will change its mind and decide it can cook at 500. No dice.**0-5 minutes** — I pour a half-pound of beans into the wok. I cover the skillet with the lid, as tight as it will ever get. I don oven mitts and start shaking the wok. At 5 minutes, I’m supposed to hear the first crack. I hear nothing but the erratic rhythm of my wok-shaking.**5-10 minutes** — Across the alleyway in the back of my house, my neighbor walks out on her patio. We say hello, and if she’s puzzled as to why I’m wearing potholders, shaking an electric wok, she gives no indication. At least she doesn’t call the police. Still no cracking sound.**10-15 minutes** — I chose my location on the patio carefully, so I can watch the TV in our basement through the screen door. The Boston Red Sox are playing the Atlanta Braves, but the game’s suspense is over before I hear the first crack. At the top of the second, the Red Sox are up 7-0. My wok has no pop; neither do the Braves.**16 minutes** — Crack! A popcorn-popping sound emerges from the wok. It’s finally happened. One down, several hundred to go.**17 minutes** — I sneak a peek at the beans. An estimated 99 percent of them look indistinguishable from the way they looked 17 minutes ago.**18-24 minutes** — There are occasional, isolated pops. Being in lousy wok-shaking shape, I’ve given up continuous shaking, and let the beans sit for a couple of minutes before resuming the shake.**25-34 minutes** — At last, I hear a rapid succession of cracks.**35 minutes** — I call it to a stop and pour the beans into a metal colander. Sweet Maria’s wasn’t kidding about the unevenness of a wok-roast, and this was hardly a by-the-book method. It looks like mixed jelly beans – some beans look like they’ve roasted sufficiently already; others are completely unchanged after more than half an hour in the wok.![wok coffee roast](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/beans_roasted3.CIBkcRC-_200EB1.webp)_Sweet Maria’s gave a fair warning: wok-roasts produce uneven results._### Aftermath Later that evening, I grind the beans and brew them in- what else? — a French press. Mysteriously, a creamy-colored head arises from the depths of the press. That doesn’t happen when I normally press coffee. Did I just home-roast coffee beans, or did I stumble on a recipe for brewing Guinness at home? It smells decent, not great. Very similar to a can of generic, pre-ground coffee. After the plunge and the pour, the resulting brew is thin in color. It looks more like tea than coffee.![french press brewing](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/roast_press3.Bmxthb-N_1MwG9t.webp)_My first home-roasted beans are pressed and ready to taste._ The moment of truth — I drink the concoction. The predominant taste is familiar — a bit of a nutty/woody flavor that makes it recognizable as Ethiopian Yirgacheffe, but it lacks the balanced taste of Ethiopian coffee roasted by the pros. Just as it looks, it tastes weak and watery. It’s not terrible — I finish the mug — but it’s nowhere near as good as professionally roasted coffee. In the following week, I brew up the home-roasted beans a few more times. I used more beans each time in hopes of brewing a stronger coffee, but it never came out very strong. There were simply too many under-roasted beans in the mix. Too watery, not “beany” enough. ### Conclusion Well, what did I expect? I invested a mere $5 in my first home-roasting venture and broke nearly half the rules of the roast. Even under ideal circumstances, Sweet Maria’s warned that wok-roasting was essentially an experiment. My brewing conditions strayed far from the instructions, and mediocre coffee was the predictable outcome. I will home-roast again. It was fun, and it’s enlightening to witness green beans crack and turn dark; I’m more in tune with what roasted beans have undergone before I buy them. But I won’t try to do it on the cheap again- I will invest in the Poppery before my next attempt. Hopefully, the result will taste more like a professional roast and less like a failed experiment.

# Roasting Routine vs. Roasting Profile [Roasting Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/roasting-coffee/)---by [Sam Hampton](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/sam-hampton/)![Roasting Routine vs. Roasting Profile](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/roasting-routine/routine1.jpg) Learning to roast coffee had a long learning curve for me. I started out as an investigative reporter when I talked to the people who, when I could find them, roasted the coffee I was drinking. The discussion was a diatribe of roasting profiles and how much a good roaster costs. Never was I let in on the fact that the process took about fifteen to twenty minutes and usually was a formula (or roast profile) developed by someone else. Over the years, I amassed information on profiles and roasting theory. Information on growing areas was a little easier to come by. It was not until the internet was unleashed that more information on the process of growing and brewing coffee was available to the average coffee drinker. The sharing of information on the internet, with blogs like ineedcoffee.com and others, has much improved the speed at which one can become knowledgeable and thereby educated in their areas of interest, such as brewing and drinking coffee. Shortly after I first tried roasting a batch of green coffee beans with a dog bowl and [heat gun](https://ineedcoffee.com/roasting-coffee-with-a-heat-gun-a-top-down-approach/), it became apparent to me that a roasting profile did not mean much just by itself. When to turn up or down the heat and how long to hold the beans at a given temperature were just one part of the much bigger job of understanding the roasting process and getting set up to do it well. Roasting with the best available hot air roaster presented a whole new area of skills to develop. Modifying sub-par poppers to perform the job expertly is a challenge, too. Then, what to do and why comes into play. Where to get green beans and which ones to buy is another area to explore. How fast or slow to roast and what are 1st and 2nd cracks and what do they sound like, and how soon after one or the other does one stop the roast and cool off the beans? How soon to drink the coffee after it is roasted, presents us with a quandary of questions. This is where and why I started to develop a Roasting Routine for my little roasting operation.![roasting routine](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/routine2.Cc31NYWJ_10yRRa.webp) The first consideration was which roaster. You have to make a choice within your budget and amass the other tools. I could not make up my mind and ended up with five different Poppers. A colander for cooling, a timer for pacing, and a thermometer for helping gauge the roast degree are just a few of the essential props. Controlling the speed of the roast can be as simple as turning the popper off and on to determine the length of the roast and a bamboo spoon for agitation. Being able to repeat a given roast cycle that you like will depend on keeping good records of your roast profile (time, temperature, and degree of roast). The other factor will be the number of green beans you roast each time. I consider the number of beans being roasted each time (by weight) as important to roasting coffee as it is in measuring out flour when baking a cake. It is imperative to develop a routine for the number of beans, roast time, and temperature if you are to come out with a consistent roasting experience. Your routine will be built around the equipment you use and your own taste preferences. The number of beans to roast in each batch was the first criterion I established in my routine. I decided to measure out 1/6th, 1/5th, 1/4th, and 1/3rd of a pound of green beans. This would determine how many roast cycles I would have to make to roast a pound of beans. I worked in metric and this amounted to 75 grams, 90 grams, 115 grams, and 150 grams of green beans. Weighing out the beans to these measurements can be as easy as taking a pound of beans and dividing them out evenly (by sight) into 6, 5, 4, or 3 portions. A small weight loss scale can facilitate this process and is usually available in thrift stores for as little as 99 cents (or a postage meter scale).![home coffee roasting setup](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/routine3.ChozYK0F_ZdXEcQ.webp) The determining factor in which portion to choose (how much to roast each time) depends on how much your popper can handle at one time, how fast it roasts, and how easily it suits your roasting style and environment. This is a balancing act. With an assembly of elements, you choose to make your roasting experience enjoyable and productive. This is the start of a standardization process for your Roasting Routine. Keeping good notes and making good observations will lead you to the roast you desire. Make a cup of coffee where you get every essential gram of goodness from each ounce of coffee you roast. That is the essence of why you are developing your Roasting Routine. I settled on 90 grams per batch for me and my roaster in the beginning. Once you get more proficient at roasting you can change your routine if you so desire. Occasionally, I now roast 113 grams in four batches to produce fourteen ounces of coffee. When I started out, the standardization of my routine helped me to gain better skills and understanding of the green bean to the coffee roasting process. The next step was to get the roasting time right. I used a router speed control to vary the power to the popper to prolong the roast. One roast at 50% power took me twenty minutes to roast to a City level roast. The roaster at 100% power took less than 4 minutes to produce a Full City roast level. The perfect roast for me lay in between these two settings.![roasting desk](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/routine1.CedFUrFL_UTGTP.webp) I now start out at 100% power up to 200 degrees F and then go to 75% or 86% power to finish out to the roast I desire. Turning down the power too low can stall the roast, but a flick of the switch to full power for ten to twenty seconds can get the roast back on track. This is the art part of the roasting profile and the intricate part of the roasting routine. With more experience and good record keeping, you can learn to prolong the time between 1st and 2nd crack, so you zero in on a City or City + or Full City roast at your will. I really felt elated when I was able to roast two batches of Kenya AA beans, one to City and the other to City +, and tell, see, and taste the difference between the batches. That was the first time I felt I was a coffee bean roaster. I had started to master my Roasting Profile. I learned to cool the beans with two screen wire colanders. I now use dried filtered compressed air to cool the beans. One blogger I read uses a pizza pan with perforated holes in the bottom to cool the beans in front of a fan. I found one at a thrift store for $1.25, so I tried it and it works very quickly. My Check List on my roll-away (portable) workbench and roasting station 1. A good light over the roasting popper 2. Log for recording the roast 3. Thermometer 4. Popper Roaster, Green Beans 5. Spoon, Scale, Cooling Pizza Pan 6. Router Control, Power Box With a heuristic approach (a hands-on, logical trial and error process) to your roasting, good record keeping, and due diligence, you can improve your coffee roasting and drinking experience by developing your own Roasting Profile.

Then He retired to dedicate the rest of his life to the things he loved, cooking, fishing, writing, fixing stuff up to run better and drinking coffee. He regrets that his long love of coffee did not include roasting coffee until recently. He is no stranger to custom roasted beans. He has often had some of the finest coffees offered. He constantly strived, regardless of where he was, to have the best coffee available under the circumstances. He just never roasted his own. Roasting his own seemed to evade him over the years, until a video by the Yankee Self-Sufficiency (Combining Snarky and Fine Coffee) encouraged him to try his hand at it. With guidance from the internet, he happened upon Sweet Maria’s and ineedcoffee.com to further his efforts. Sam Hampton has never been one to take advice at face value and he likes to add his own touch to anything he attempts. Sam Hampton now lives, tinkers and writes from San Jose, Ca.

# Saul Bellow: Coffee Achiever [Coffee People](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/coffee-people/)---by [Myron Joshua](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/myron-joshua/)![Saul Bellow: Coffee Achiever](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/saul-bellow-coffee-achiever/bellow125x149.jpg)**Elitism and Democracy: Coffee in the Life and Literature of Saul Bellow** The fine line between coffee _aficionado_ and coffee _snob_ is finer than that which divides a perfect espresso from one over-extracted. Coffee lovers may be a truck driver on the highway in need of an invigorating drink or someone with a love for great taste. He/she may be a person who brings a broader knowledge into his/her experience, or a snob who can not believe that others “really” appreciate the nuances of the blend, etc. When one tries to develop his taste and increase his knowledge, he may be viewed by others as a snob.![saul bellow](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/bellow125x149.C3rDSkIV_2fyhHo.webp)_Saul Bellow_ Coffee is at once the most democratic beverage and one that allows for endless cultivation of individual taste and the chance to achieve excellence. Add to this the social aspect of coffee drinking and you have the makings of a beverage that can serve as a complex social icon. Nobel Laureate Saul Bellow seems to be living in the tension between his admiration of excellence and achievement and his connectedness with humanity as such. Viennese professor of English Literature, Prof. Kurt Meyer makes a distinction between a modernist “elitist” trend in American literature and a postmodern trend that makes a series of moves toward democratic notions. “You are right,” he wrote me, “in assessing Saul Bellow as straddling the dividing line between the two”. It will not be difficult for us coffee lovers to understand how the motif of coffee can be used to express the tension between elitist trends and more democratic values of basic human experience. This article will show how this happens in the novels and autobiographic thoughts of Bellow when he relates to coffee-a drink he really appreciates. ### Bellow and the Culinary Arts In a New York Times Review of Books article appearing on May 18, 1983, Mimi Sheraton quotes the Nobel Prize winning author as saying: ”I eat in ethnic restaurants in Chicago and at my club, Les Nomades, which has a good French kitchen – maybe the best in the city. It’s a _private dining club_, but _it’s not too hard to become a member_. In this line, we can feel the ambivalence that Bellow feels about catering to his refined taste (best French restaurant in the city) and not wanting to be an elitist removed from the people (private club BUT not too hard to become a member.). We read that “Mr. Bellow likes wine. ‘But I don’t believe in becoming a **feinschmecker**,’ he said. ‘Most of all I adore good French and Italian cooking, but I’m not willing to endure all of the rudeness one is subjected to in so many fancy restaurants. _I hate refined restaurant esthetes_ – the gourmet bullies who treat you as though you are part of the ugly crowd.’” Here again, we feel Bellow’s appreciation of quality but his despise for the rudeness of elitist esthetes. He seems to be claiming that the “feinschmeckery” attitude of the refined is actually uncouth.![Saul Bellow Interview Photo](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/interview1.bw-7fDq6_ZiI4qh.webp)_Saul Bellow Interview Photo_### Bellow and Coffee For us Coffee Lovers this stance should be quite familiar. Being particular about wine makes one a feinshcmecker, being particular about a certain Cola means that you are a fanatic but being concerned about coffee-well, could go either way or, hopefully, maybe something else altogether. We will not be surprised that Bellow has specific tastes in coffee as well: “‘I still do the cooking if Alexandra (his wife-mj) is busy and I prepare (tea and) coffee,’ he continued. ‘I’m **very particular** about both. I never use tap water for either because it’s so awful here in Chicago. I use bottled water…’ The coffee blend Mr. Bellow prefers is a combination of Colombian and Armenian beans that he buys at a local supermarket and grinds just before brewing them in a _filter-lined drip coffee pot_. ‘Sometimes I make cowboy coffee,’ he said. ‘I put the grounds in a saucepan full of water and _just let them come to first boil -the first bubble_. Then I let the whole thing settle.’” ### Coffee Culture in Sammler’s Planet and Ravelstien Coffee, as we saw above, is part of Bellow’s daily life. He is particular about his favorite blend and grinds his own beans just before brewing. He carefully prepares his cowboy coffee-not letting it boil. This image of a man carefully going through this daily ritual appears in Bellow’s 1970 novel, **Mr. Sammler’s Planet** (Viking Press, 1970). > “Mr. Sammler ground his coffee in a square box, cranking counterclockwise between long knees. To commonplace actions he brought a special pedantic awkwardness. In Poland, France, England, students, young gentlemen of his time, had been unacquainted with kitchens. Now he did things that cooks and maids had once done. He did them with a certain priestly stiffness. Acknowledgement of social descent. Historical ruin. Transformation of society. It was beyond personal humbling. He had gotten over those ideas during the war in Poland-utterly gotten over all that, especially the idiotic pain of losing class privileges.” So, grinding one’s own coffee in priest-like motions is a sign of sacrificing the definition of status. Yet it is done with “priest-like stiffness”-perhaps stiff since he was not really used to it, but priest-like, with a religious statue, nonetheless. As Sammler continues his coffee preparation we see that through the careful use of detail an atmosphere is created that reminds one of a chemist or pharmacist at work. At the same time, it reminds us of the meager existence that is Sammler’s fate. There is no status here; instead, there is careful, professional, and loving preparation of the brew. > “The grounds in the little drawer of the mill he held above the flask. The red coil went deeper, whiter, white. The kinks had tantrums. Beads of water flashed up. Individually the pioneers _gracefully_ went to the surface. Then they all seethed together. He poured in the grounds. In his cup, a lump of sugar, a dusty spoonful of Pream. Coffee here is the drink of the simple man. It is a common drink that can be prepared in a ritual-like way as a priest or a chemist might tend to their work and it is this care that is exalting even in light of the dusty spoonful of Pream. In his last novel, **Ravelstein**, (Viking Press, 2000) Bellow creates a sort of antithesis to Sammler. Coffee is taken at a high-class French Coffee house and its preparation at the home can be an extravaganza!![](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/saul-bellow-ravelstein.C_m4PN0S_Zp0ywP.webp)_Ravelstein (Penguin Great Books of the 20th Century) by Saul Bellow. Cover photo of Ravelstein by Richard Dunkley, a London-based portrait and lifestyle photographer._ Abe Ravelstein, the intellectual and financially successful professor, has extravagant taste. A scene in the book that is oft-quoted in reviews tells us that, sitting in a French Cafe, > “Abe went for his third espresso serre when the waiter set it down; Ravelstein’s big, unskillful hand gripped the little cup as he carried it to his mouth. I would have given big odds on the outcome if a bet had been offered. Brown stains appeared on the lapel of his new coat. It was unpreventable-a fatality. …’Ah, well,’ he siad, when he at last saw that he had soiled his ($4,500) Lanvin laper. ‘I’ve fucked up again.’ I didn’t laugh at his remark.” The extravagant Ravelstein, while being a very successful intellectual and “overly well dressed” shows certain signs of being uncouth. Sammler’s unskillful hand carefully ground coffee, and heated water in a flask where the whole operation was “graceful”-although he only had dusty Pream to cap off the cup. Ravelsteins hand turned his espresso serre into a staining agent. As much as Raveltstein loves coffee, he doesn’t seem able to simply enjoy it. In his private home, Ravelstein also combines an extravagant love with a sort of blundering when it comes to basics. > While “Ravelstein could not compete with the collection of Matisses and Chagalls” of his neighbors, “..in the kitchen he went far beyond them. From a restaurant supply company he had bought an espresso machine. It was installed in the kitchen, _it dominated the sink, and it steamed and fizzed explosively…The huge commercial machine made the sink unusable. But Ravelstein had no use for sinks-it was only the coffee that mattered_.” Although Ravelstein overdoes it, it does seem that he places the coffee itself at center stage. Yet the narrator (Chick) says, “I refused to drink his coffee because it was made with chlorinated tap water.” (Sounds familiar? see Bellow’s remarks above of how he himself doesn’t use tap water but only bottled water.) It steamed and fizzled, a wonderful show but the coffee was undrinkable due to the fundamental ingredient, water. The jacket of the Ravelstein shows the Cafe Flore in Paris and may point simultaneously to Abe Ravelstein’s high taste and his need for social contact. Coffee is not just a drink to be prepared and enjoyed according to your personality. Over a cup of coffee, in the right setting, social contacts are developed and thoughts are exchanged. The importance of coffee in this social setting for Bellow is evident in the quote brought by James Atlas, in his biography of Saul Bellow, **Bellow**, (Random House, 2000.) > “‘Beranos, the French religious novelist, said that his soul could not bear to be cut off from its kind, and that was shy he did his work in cafes, ‘ Bellows noted enviously: ‘Cafes indeed! I would have kissed the floor of a cafe. There were no cafes in Chicago. There were greasy-spoon cafeterias, one-arm joints, taverns. I never yet heard of a writer who brought his manuscripts into a tavern.’” Looking back Bellow sounds envious of those who could develop intellectually in an elitist social setting. Ravelstien revels in this type of setting. But Bellow seems a bit critical of the extravagance and lack of proportion that accompanies his protagonist’s reveling. The pleasure of his social setting may lead to seeing the importance of social status rather than real social/human contact is to be developed in that setting. Bellow believes in nurturing taste and expertise but is not willing to let his culture drive a wedge between him and his fellow man, blinding him to the essentials. Saul Bellow understands the nature of coffee: it is a beverage to be prepared with care to ensure quality taste; a drink that is a process and does more than merely quench your thirst. It is a drink that can elevate the individual while keeping him in touch with the essentials of this world. Coffee is a drink that leaves various marks as part of our daily ritual whether you live in high style like Ravelstien or have a makeshift kitchen in a one-room apartment like Sammler. Bellow seems to understand the enticement of “sophistication” and of forever advancing with the ritual of coffee. But, more so, he realizes that true refinement means remaining rooted in the basics. In this sense, Mr. Bellow is a midwesterner through and through. As Hywel Williams notes in his November 18, 2000 review of Atlas’ book in “The Guardian” > “It [Chicago] was his kind of town, if only because it wasn’t New York. Bellow has always needed his willed sense of exclusion. Chicago was mid-western, raw and heterodox, where New York was too obviously sophisticated. The local university was no Ivy League conspiracy of gentlemen whose highest cultural aspiration was to join Eliot and James on the boat back to the old country. Chicago alone could nurture Bellow’s mythic sense of the American writer’s selfhood.” ### Author’s Note In memory of my father, Herbert Joshua, a man with exquisite taste buds (manufacturer of fine Jubillee [Food Producer’s International] hot chocolate, ice cream toppings, etc.) and lover of Everyman.

# Searching for the Perfect Cup [Cafe Culture](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/cafe-culture/)---by [Rick Abbott](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/rick-abbott/)![Searching for the Perfect Cup](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/searching-for-the-perfect-cup/carolinewatching1.jpg) I am a user. I became dependent at the age of 17 when making a long commute to college on a bus. I knew that I need a little something to help me through the day and so I started using it. At first, I thought that I could handle it, but then it got out of control. I found myself using it between classes, before and after school, and often just before I went to bed. At one point I lost my head and started using right in class. No one noticed… I continued. I remember one day sitting wide-eyed in the quad and a guy came up to me and asked if I wanted some pot. I smiled and said that I had already had two that day. He didn’t get it, “Two what?” “Two pots!” I smiled and he walked on. Those days were easy. You could get it on nearly every corner (at least in Seattle and the Silicon Valley). I made it through college and as I began work I continued my daily doses in the morning. I began taking a supply with me. The habit became rather expensive so we got the basic equipment to make our own at home. Although this was the cheaper way to go I found that I was using it more and more. Over the years my body has become totally immune to the effects. I can use it right before bed and not miss a wink. Nearly all my friends are users so there is no stigma to my habit. My office provides all that I need, our church has plenty at every gathering. I shop at stores that greet me with a fresh dose at the door. However, a few years ago my wife and I became a bit bored with the regular and average batches that we were used to. My father (a long-time addict) introduced us to a way of using steam injection and increasing potency. This was good! At the same time, we added a few other things and created new concoctions that we served to our friends. Life returned to normal and our new equipment now became a permanent fixture in the kitchen, no longer hidden away when the company came to visit. The word was out and it was now expected when they came to visit. A shot here and there, and everyone was smiling.![caroline watching roast](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/carolinewatching1.D2J6GR0W_Z1jwvn6.webp)_Caroline Watching the Fresh Roast_ The obsessive/compulsive gene flipped on to a new level this past month. While we have never been able to grow our own because of the climate where we live (we are considering moving to Bogota, Colombia) we have found a step in the process that we had been neglecting. Leave it to my favorite dealer (my father) to provide me with yet another piece of equipment for the process – a roaster. Now, we can order a few kilos of our favorite beans and roast them to the level of perfection that would make Juan Valdez cry with joy and envy. Before you think that I have gone a little too far, you need to read some of the stuff that comes across the T-1 at work on the subject of roasting the perfect cup. First, my father purchased this amazing contraption for brewing a cup called a Cona. I can’t describe this other than to say that it looks like a bong. It actually took a lot of convincing on his part to assure me that they weren’t doing dope (they do live on the Mexican border). They talk of stalls, how long until they get their first crack (more drug terms), rolling crack (I thought this is what you did to smoke crack until I realized that it meant something else), and which beans are the best. We now find ourselves sitting at the counter timing the cracks, looking at colors on a chart that we are keeping, and logging our roasts. Twenty-four hours later we are cupping to see how it turned out, sometimes tossing the batch because it just didn’t meet our standards. We find ourselves saying things like “Well, Tom said that we should roast it this way” or “Tom said that this will have a flavor like…” We really don’t know who Tom is, but we know that he knows. Everyone knows that he knows. Part of me longs for the days when I could whip into the local convenience store and buy 20 ounces of coffee (in a horrible Styrofoam cup) and not raise my nose in disgust. It was so simple then. But I’m a user in search of the perfect cup. Therefore, I roast! ### Resources [Home Roasting Coffee with the Fresh Roast](https://ineedcoffee.com/home-roasting-coffee-with-the-fresh-roast/) – INeedCoffee tutorial.

# Senseo Coffee Brewing [Brewing Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/brewing-coffee/)---by [Michael Allen Smith](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/michael-allen-smith/)![Senseo Coffee Brewing](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/senseo-coffee-brewing/brew3501.jpg) The two most important words when discussing coffee are quality and convenience. For the most part, we want both, but often, we must make choices. Some of us will go to any lengths to achieve quality, whereas others will gravitate towards convenience even at the expense of quality. The Senseo Coffee Machine is all about convenience. If you enjoy the taste of richer brewed coffees, such as those made with French presses, espresso machines, or vac-pots, you can stop reading now. If you only drink freshly roasted coffee, you can stop reading now. You have already evolved further on your coffee journey; you will gain nothing from owning a Senseo. The Senseo Coffee Machine will brew a weak, bitter cup of coffee more easily and quickly than any brewing method. If you prefer a weaker cup of coffee but find instant coffee too challenging to brew, you may like the Senseo.![Senseo Coffee Maker](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/brew3501.B0vCWqyf_ZoW0x7.webp)_Senseo Coffee Maker_### What is a Pod? The Senseo is a pod-based brewing system. A pod is a coffee that is pre-packaged inside its filter. It is to coffee what a teabag is to tea. The benefit of the pod is that each one is perfectly measured out and requires no cleanup effort. The disadvantage to the pod is the coffee is only as fresh as when it was ground and placed into the pod. In other words, it violates one of the rules of quality coffee: grind your coffee as close to brewing as possible. And please don’t tell me how the bags are vacuum-sealed and the flavor is trapped. I know better. ### Step By Step Brewing There is a water reservoir in the back of the machine. Fill it with water. The reservoir has easy-to-read minimum and maximum lines. As with any brewing method, use water of the quality you would normally drink. There are two pod holders that come with Senseo: a single and a double. As you would expect, the single pod holder holds one pod, and the double holds two. Each pod will brew enough for one cup (more on this later). Load the pod and the correct pod holder.![Load Pods](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/load350.smeUlze6_Z1HPi5i.webp)_Load Pods_ Close the lid and lock the lever. Press the middle button. It will start flashing. Once it stops flashing, it is ready. In my tests, it really isn’t ready until 30-60 seconds after the light stops flashing. Coffee brewed as soon as the flashing stops will come out at a lukewarm 140 F, but waiting 30-60 seconds will generate 160 F coffee. Press one of the two brew buttons. Use the 1-cup button on the left if you have a single pod. If you use two pods, press the 2-cup button on the right.![Senseo buttons](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/buttons350.DqOlPHvI_HxAnM.webp)_Senseo buttons_### Cleanup and Maintenance Because it is a pod system, there is no real cleanup. This is one clean brewing system that requires no maintenance. ### Cupping the Senseo The Senseo is not only a brewing system but also a coffee line. The Senseo coffee pods come in four different _varietals_: Mild Roast, Medium Roast, Dark Roast, and Decaffeinated. There is no dancing around this topic. The Senseo makes awful coffee. It’s weak and bitter. Granted, I’m a coffee snob who roasts his own coffee and brews espresso and French press every day, so consider the source. I’d put the Senseo higher than instant coffee and lower than canned drip on the coffee hierarchy. I could have quit after trying several bitter cups, but I was determined to discover if the Senseo was salvageable. Sara Lee’s coffee for Senseo was low-grade. Maybe all this machine needed was some quality coffee? Unfortunately, I couldn’t grind up my home roast since this machine required pods. I got in the car and drove to the nearest Starbucks. It sells a decent espresso blend that works as a drip coffee in pod form. When I returned home I discovered the Starbucks pod was much smaller than the Senseo pod, therefore it wouldn’t work. The Senseo has its custom pod size.![Senseo and Starbucks pods](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/pods3501.CVWXYbxz_Z1nJSvb.webp)_Starbucks pod on left, Senseo on right_ I should have given up here, but I didn’t. I grabbed a pair of scissors and performed surgery on one of the Senseo pods. I removed all the stale, tasteless coffee from one pod and replaced it with some Ethiopian Sidamo that I had roasted two days ago. Then I brewed again. Most of the bitterness was gone, but the coffee was still too weak to drink. ### Hope for the Senseo? As of this writing, the Senseo people are doing a full-court advertising blitz for this brewing system, including television ads. I even saw a half-page _review_ in the May 2004 Wired magazine calling the Senso a “perfect cup of joe”. This poor choice of words will make me question every other _review_ I read in that magazine. I hoped this machine would be the fast brew solution for those who never brew more than one mug at a time. Sadly, the brewing system yields a very weak beverage that lacks the richness one should expect from a good cup of coffee. Regardless of my opinion, they will sell quite a few of these machines. If they unload a lot of these machines, the word will eventually get out that the coffee sucks. Hopefully, quality coffee roasters will offer Senseo-compatible pods of their own. How do we get around the weakness? Simple. Use two pods in the 2-pod holder and then press the 1-cup button. Part 2 of this article is [Senseo Revisited](https://ineedcoffee.com/senseo-coffee-brewing-revisited/).

# Seeing the World One Starbucks at a Time [Cafe Culture](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/cafe-culture/)---by [Winter](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/winter/)![Seeing the World One Starbucks at a Time](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/seeing-the-world-one-starbucks-at-a-time/10.jpg) So you think Starbucks has awful coffee, eh? Well, I’m no coffee connoisseur, and I’m certainly not here to tell you Starbucks is the best. I do, however, make the claim that Starbucks’ ubiquity, credited by some for the blandification of America (and the world), has changed my life by giving me the motivation to see and experience much of what this country has to offer. I think first of the landscapes, perhaps because some of the views I have experienced are breathtaking for a city boy from flat, urban Houston. I have seen forests and mountains, rivers, and wheat-filled plains that I would never otherwise have seen in my “ordinary” life as a computer programmer. In fact, I was never much of a nature person at all, but my travels have led me to appreciate the vast wilderness this country still has (and to lament its ongoing destruction as suburban sprawl blights the land). That’s not to say that I don’t like cities and people–I very much love to see great architecture and funky buildings, small-town Main Streets, and I enjoy the cultural differences that are found all over the land. My Starbucks travels have allowed me many memorable encounters with all types around the country, and, to a lesser extent, around the world. Though my own personal wackiness makes up much of the humor in the documentary film [Starbucking](https://ineedcoffee.com/starbucking-honest-artistry/), a goodly number of funny moments stem from my interactions with the people I have encountered during my travels. Ten years later, I shudder to think of how I might have squandered the last decade hanging out in the same shop every night, the same clubs every weekend, the same restaurants, the same old concrete jungle. Instead, my pursuit of every Starbucks has taken me far afield, to every corner of this great country, and cliched though this might sound, getting there has very often been half, or most, of the fun. Just recently, in fact, I finally had a chance to travel to the Starbucks in Prineville, OR. Now, while it might be an overstatement to say that Prineville is in the middle of nowhere, the town is certainly remote, and far from a bustling metropolis. The fact that the Starbucks closes at the ridiculously early hour of 7:30 PM is proof enough of that.![Starbucks - Prineville, OR](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/11.CvE-CKjr_29Cpxb.webp)_Starbucks – Prineville, OR_ To be sure, I did complain some during the five-hour drive from Boise, ID, especially when stuck behind slow-moving vehicles or when the sharp curves induced a bit of vertigo, but I would have to say that the experience was well worth it for views like this one.![Boise, ID View](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/2.CnMiuvmZ_1rVWr0.webp)_Boise, ID View_ Back in Idaho, near the resort/ski town of Sun Valley, sits a town with the quaint name of Ketchum, and a decidedly Old West look about Main Street. It was a long drive to Ketchum, from Lewiston, through a Native American reservation and several national forests. But it was a scenic journey well worth making (once) and the Starbucks at the end was decidedly out of the ordinary, one of the many examples that prove that no, not all Starbucks look alike. This one in particular was so well-decorated with pieces by a local artist that it had a bit of a gallery feel about it. How many galleries let you sip the joe while perusing the works, I wonder?![Starbucks - Ketchum, ID](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/3.DC-KoOyh_1H93Su.webp)_Starbucks – Ketchum, ID_![Starbucks - Ketchum, ID side view](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/4.C0z-REEU_Z1GI65g.webp)_Starbucks – Ketchum, ID side view_ View on the approach to Lewiston from the north.![Lewiston, ID View](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/5.C8YB2VCl_1b5Npe.webp)_Lewiston, ID View_ Other unusual routes come to mind, like US-550 from Bernalillo (a suburb of Albuquerque) to Bloomfield/Farmington, then up into Colorado to Durango and Montrose.![horses](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/6.CnKllan3_70coW.webp)![Cold Stone Starbucks](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/7.3xcO7wb1_Z16ohtj.webp) Really, with the way Starbucks is going, the possibilities for travel across this country are endless. And America is more than just mountains and horses of course. In fact, I tend to prefer urban landscapes. The film Starbucking by necessity focuses on the wackier aspects of my travels and gives only glimpses of well-known landmarks like the streets of San Francisco, the ever-astounding New York skyline, or even lesser-known attractions like the pyramid visible on the approach to Memphis. If you could view my memory as a film, you would see great architecture across the country and the world, views from some of the tallest buildings (a favorite interest of mine), or just fascinating images like a sea of scooters crossing a busy intersection in Taiwan.![city view](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/8.4BvxAbOq_ZyoGHz.webp)![memphis](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/9.D11YrXpS_ZQ63s7.webp)![Starbucks](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/10.4t-PzkXD_16pvJA.webp)![Starbucks Asia](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/111.BxZN1YhN_PlO9n.webp) People make up this country as much as the landscape, and every region offers its own unique character. The South, of course, is well known for its food, its accent, and, yes, even Good ol’ Boy cops still stuck in the 60s. We get a little taste of that in the Starbucking DVD, (available now from Heretic Indie Films), from the Alabama motorist whose accent dripped as thick as molasses to the Museum of Pioneer Alabama. And farther down the road, the Slidell cop who didn’t mind making up his own laws in order to get his way. And, though, omitted from the film, my experiences at mom-n-pop restaurants throughout the South, such as Betty’s Cafeteria in Bainbridge, GA, where the staff will gladly sit on your toothbrush (no extra charge).![Betty&amp;#x27;s Cafeteria in Bainbridge, GA](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/13.CJAhXgi6_ZNif3u.webp)_Betty’s Cafeteria in Bainbridge, GA_ Clear across the continent, Starbucks’ growth is nowhere more evident than in California, where more than a quarter of the Starbucks in North America are located. I visit Cali so often in a vain attempt to keep up that I feel like its urban landscape (much of it a wasteland) is burned into my brain. One thing I have come to expect is that typically Californian wackiness can be found anywhere, anytime. Take the store in San Pablo where I encountered Kelly, a shaven-headed, well-pierced, possibly indigent, a fan of the almond soy latte. In Starbucking, Kelly states that she finds my travels “sexy” and that she frequents the Starbucks “all the time, dude”. I could never imagine ending my travels and missing out on overcaffeinated encounters like this.![Starbucks - San Pablo](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/14.CjzH7pqs_KgJr2.webp)_Starbucks – San Pablo_ I could go on and on ad infinitum. Ten years of traveling the country have given me more experiences than many will have in a lifetime, combined with the full realization that there is so much more to America than I was motivated to see in my pre-Starbucking days. I take comfort in the fact that, when Homeland Security eventually throws me in Guantanamo, I will be able to draw on an endless sea of memories to keep me warm. To think that, as a young man, I imagined remaining in Texas forever! Horrifying it is, to think that now. A final note. Yes, it is absolutely true that I could have gone a-traveling without this specific goal in mind–anybody can. But Starbucks gave me the motivation, and sometimes we all need a little push in the right direction. Or in my case, every direction.![DVD starbucking winter](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/dvd-starbucking-winter1.CXcH82tZ_NOJaC.webp) Published on May 1, 2007--- #### Winter [Follow Winter on X](https://x.com/winterene)Winter is the person behind Starbucks Everywhere, a web site dedicated to chronicle his lifelong quest to drink coffee from every Starbucks in the world.

# Senseo Coffee Brewing Revisited [Brewing Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/brewing-coffee/)---by [Michael Allen Smith](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/michael-allen-smith/) A few months ago, the article “Senseo Coffee Brewing” was released. In the brewing tutorial, I concluded that the machine produced very weak and bitter coffee. Since then, I’ve received numerous emails about the Senseo brewing system. Here are some of the questions received in the last few months. ### Do you recommend the Senseo? Typically, INeedCoffee avoids reviews. We would prefer to stick to tutorials and tips. However, I felt this was a case where we couldn’t hide the truth. The truth is that the Senseo makes dreadful coffee. The machine does a disservice to coffee. I knew Senseo was doing a massive advertising blitz, so INeedCoffee couldn’t stay silent. ### Can the bitterness be avoided by using two pods? Using two pods will not correct the bitterness; it will only correct the weakness. For the Senseo to produce a cup of coffee that isn’t bitter, a quality third-party roaster will have to surface that offers fresh Senseo-friendly pods. ### Have you tried any of the 3rd party pods? No. I unloaded my Senseo on the used market shortly before the article was released. I’d advise others to do the same before the price collapses after the holidays. I guess that eBay and Amazon Marketplace will be flooded with these machines in January. ### Where can you buy replacement pods? Amazon.com sells the Senseo pods. ### What do you think of the Keurig or Flavia brewing systems? I have never tried either. If the Keurig or Flavia people would like a brewing tutorial written on INeedCoffee, they are more than happy to ship me a unit. Of course, they run the risk that if it performs as poorly as the Senseo, our readers will find out. Or they (or one of their distributors) could send us a brewing tutorial with photos (free of marketing spin) that also covers machine maintenance. ### I like the Senseo. Good for you. ### Can you make your own pods? In the article, I did a quick hack using scissors and my own home-roasted coffee. It was just a quick hack. For a more detailed step-by-step tutorial, read [Make Your Own Coffee Pods](https://ineedcoffee.com/make-your-own-coffee-pods/) by John Wolf. ### Did the Senseo produce foam as it shows in the commercial? The _foamy effect_ is something that looks good, but I’m not sure if it’s good. Crema in espresso is good, crema in brewed coffee means the beans didn’t make contact with the water at that point, usually due to extreme freshness. The Senseo is neither brewing method and the coffee was beyond stale, but it did produce a foamy effect. ### Thank you. I almost bought one of these machines at Costco. You’re welcome. ### Final thoughts? It’s obvious that Senseo was developed for the LAZY coffee drinker that piles in so much cream and sugar that anything short of motor oil would taste acceptable. If you LIKE the taste of coffee, consider another brewing system. If you want something quick and easy, it’s still hard to beat the auto-drip machine with a timer.**December 2005 UPDATE** I’ve received many positive emails regarding the Ecopad refillable Coffeepod Senseo permanent filter. Although messy, this refillable filter allows users to take control of their coffee. If you own a Senseo this may be worth a look.

# Sex and Coffee [Coffee History](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/coffee-history/)---by [Chris Arnold](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/chris-arnold/)![Sex and Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/sex-and-coffee/petition11.jpg) Coffee has supposedly been around since about 1200 A.D., and sex has been with us since we began procreating. So it only makes sense that there would be some link between coffee and sex. And there are in fact many links; some in ways you did not even imagine. It seems that women at one point blamed coffee for everything from homosexuality to lack of virility. Eventually, it was praised for its sexual performance-enhancing capabilities, among other benefits. These beliefs were held in times when medical and scientific practices were questionable at best. However, modern-day studies and surveys suggest that coffee and sex still are linked, and important in the minds of both young adults and the elderly alike. Even big-name coffee companies are getting in on the action. Read on for all the details. ### The 1500s #### Venice and Turkey – Coffee Turns Men Homosexual? A Venetian ambassador to Turkey back in 1571 wrote back home and basically said that coffee caused men to become homosexuals. He saw Turkish men going to bathhouses (where coffee was served), and into coffee houses absent of women. And soldiers were considered to be homosexual because of their coffee drinking habits. Along with that, there was an idea back then that you could actually change your sexuality, your body, and even your genitalia (a penis would slowly shrink and turn inside out, creating a vagina) by drinking or eating certain drinks or foods. So logically, coffee caused men to become homosexuals, and perhaps even turn into women if given enough time. Thankfully, to the delight of many coffee-drinking men, this never happened. ### The 1600s #### London – Coffee Turns Men Off? The “Maidens of London” blamed coffee for their husbands’ lack of sexual interest. Coffeehouses were really for men only (although pubs and taverns were for all). When brothels were moved above coffeehouses in the mid-1600s, many men would have coffee, a good political discussion, and then move upstairs to visit a prostitute for a final treat. When they would come home, they weren’t interested in having sex with their wives, and thus coffee was blamed for men’s lack of interest in the bedroom. Of course, the result was that women tended to be anti-coffee, and men were pro-coffee (and I don’t blame them). In 1663 “The Maiden’s Complaint Against the Coffee House” was published by British women. In essence, they stated that their men were coming home late, did not want to have sex, and it was all due to coffee. Of course, the men did not tell them about all the features of the Coffee House. In 1664 the “Women’s Petition against Coffee” was published by the women of London. Here are a few strong excerpts from that famous document: > Coffee leads men to trifle away their time, scald their chops, and spend their money, all for a little base, black, thick, nasty, bitter, stinking nauseous puddle water. > …excessive use of that newfangled, abominable, heathenish liquor called coffee, which riffling nature of her choicest treasures, and drying up the radical moisture, has so eunucht our husbands, and crippled our more kind gallants, that they are become as impotent as age, and as unfruitful as those deserts where that unhappy berry is said to be brought. > …the coffee-house being in truth, only a pimp to the tavern, thus like tennis balls between two rackets, the fopps our husbands are bandied to and fro all day between the coffee-house and the tavern…for when people have swill’d their morning draught of more ale than a brewer’s horse can carry, hither they come for a pennyworth of settle-brain, where they are sure to meet enow lazy pragmatical companions, that resort here to prattle of news, that they neither understand, nor are concerned in; and after an hour’s impertinent chat, begin to consider a bottle of claret would do excellent well before dinner; whereupon to the Bush they all march again together, till every one of them is drunk as a drum, and then back again to the coffee-house to drink themselves sober. The women were not successful. In fact, newspapers and mail began to be delivered to some coffeehouses instead of homes. Have you seen 17th-century British women? I would probably rather live at the coffee house too.![womens petition against coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/petition11.B9V-IZD0_1UCFFx.webp)_Source: [Women’s Petition against Coffee](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Women&#x27;s_Petition_against_Coffee) (Wikisource)_### The 1700s #### Cause of Divorce? Coffee was used by “experts” to increase sexual pleasure, going way back to the 1700s. Wives unofficially outlawed coffee, because the men could now really think for themselves (as opposed to the beer or grog-induced stupor of the middle ages). Men resisted, women finally tried coffee themselves, and then did a 180. Now, they began using coffee as grounds for divorce! Now, if a man could not provide coffee for his lovely wife, he was gone (and she kept the coffee pot). These were legal precedents set at least 300 years ago. Those poor men couldn’t win. #### Brothel Madams and Coffee Patents? There are more international coffee patents held by brothel madams than men. In France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and Switzerland, brothel madams own more patents than men in each country. Why would brothel madams even go to the effort of patenting all these coffee-making apparatuses? They were coffee junkies, and that caffeine buzz motivated them to get busy with some really cool coffee inventions. They, of course, believed that coffee helped them (and their Johns) in the sexual performance area, as well as provided overall alertness. It was a match made, well, in a brothel. ### Modern Day #### First Date Drink of Choice What do most people drink on the first date? Coffee, of course! Regardless of how some may initially think that alcohol would be the best first-date primer, how many first-time meetings happen at coffee shops? The empirical evidence suggests about 90%. Coffee rules. Try having sex while drunk, and see if you enjoy it (or remember it for that matter)! #### Would You Give Up Sex or Coffee? The high-end coffeemaker and espresso machine company Capresso, did a survey in 2001 to see how serious people were about their coffee. They were all sexually active, coffee-drinking adults who had internet access, and enjoyed chocolate. The question was: If you had to give up one of the following for a month, which would it be? Coffee, Sex, Excuses, Internet access at home, or Chocolate? Coffee was only second to sex on the priority list for both men and women. Maybe Sex and Coffee are more related than we think? And for women and men to have some sort of agreement? Mark that down, it is one of the few things men and women have ever agreed on. This is one for the history books. #### Scientific Evidence Caffeine is a stimulant. The effects of caffeine on the body tend to be immediate. All the organs and tissues are stimulated. Caffeine interacts directly with cells by changing chemical reactions within the cells. Caffeine indirectly affects cells by increasing epinephrine/adrenaline in the adrenal glands, as well as norepinephrine/noradrenaline hormones. These in turn stimulate cell activity. A small amount of caffeine can stimulate the brain cells, improving concentration and reaction times. It can also stimulate the heart, increasing the pumping action. Of course, the clitoris and penis are filled with blood vessels, so the logical conclusion is that these organs benefit from increased blood flow, and in turn, enhanced sexual pleasure and performance. OK, OK, can we please finish the article before you dash off to brew that pot of coffee? Almost done, I promise. In a study of sexual activity in the elderly conducted by bio psychiatrists, the conclusion was that with at least one cup of coffee a day, elderly women had a much higher rate of sexual activity, and elderly men had a much higher potency rate. Source: [Sexual function in the elderly](https://www.biopsychiatry.com/coffeesex.htm). ### Conclusion We know that based on other articles on [coffee and health](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/coffee-health/), a moderate intake of coffee is probably not harmful, and may even be beneficial. So what about the tie-in to sex? Well, it seems that caffeine intake may help in the sexual energy and performance area. Will it replace your Viagra, Cialis, or Levitra? Probably not, but it will not cause blindness either. So if you have gotten into the habit of taking a nap instead of having sex, maybe coffee is your answer. Just make sure to brush your teeth after that triple shot. We all know coffee breath is not very sexy. Published on October 1, 2007--- #### Chris Arnold Chris is the creator of Two Bit History.

# Sherwood SMF-1000 Automatic Electric Milk Frother and Warmer Review [Espresso](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/espresso/)---by [Chris Arnold](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/chris-arnold/)![Sherwood SMF-1000 Automatic Electric Milk Frother and Warmer Review](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/sherwood-smf-1000-automatic-electric-milk-frother-warmer-review/DSC00635.jpg)_**UPDATE September 2020:** The Sherwood SMF-1000 Automatic Electric Milk Frother is no longer available for purchase._ When I reviewed the LifStyl Milk Frother*, I thought I had found the perfect solution to steamed milk, without having to resort to using my espresso machine to make an entire pitcher. It also allowed me to make hot milk without any foam, which is awesome for when you don’t want all that foam. Enter the Sherwood SMF-1000 Automatic Electric Milk Frother and Warmer for Cappuccinos and Lattes. It is a white unit, with color accents available in Red, Orange, Green, and Purple. With its higher price tag, can it compete with the LifStyl Frother? What additional functionality does the Sherwood Milk Frother bring? Read on to find out. The Sherwood milk frother consists of 4 parts: - Main pitcher with markings inside to help you not underfill or overfill - A removable magnetic whisk that leaves the entire inside open for obstruction-free cleaning - Lid - Base![Sherwood Milk Frother](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/DSC00635.DWjD78iQ_Zjdljt.webp)![Removable Magnetic Whisk](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/DSC00642.BxAxkMOU_1wej59.webp) The Sherwood milk frother has three lines on the inside (from the manual): 1. **Max Milk** – Fill milk to this line for the “Hot Milk” function 2. **Max Froth –** Fill milk to this line for both “Hot Froth” and “Cold Froth” functions. 3. **Min –** Milk should always be filled to at least this line when in use.![Sherwood Frother Min and Max Lines](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/DSC00641.CuntfoM-_Z1dtVTC.webp)![Base and Cordless Carafe](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/DSC00639.BuY8NFlz_17Q9lT.webp) The Sherwood milk frother has a single button with three functions and light indicators (from the manual): ### Press Once for Hot Froth Heats and vigorously stirs milk to create a thick, hot froth ideal for cappuccinos. Fill milk between the Min and Max Froth lines. Press the Power button once. The indicator light will illuminate in a solid red. ### Press Twice for Hot Milk Heats with mild stirring for hot, airy milk, ideal for hot chocolates and lattes. Fill milk between the Min and Max Milk lines. Press the Power button twice. The indicator light will blink on and off in red. ### Press and Hold for Cold Froth Stir vigorously without heat to create a thick froth ideal for iced cappuccinos and lattes. Fill milk between the Min and Max Froth lines. Hold the Power button down. The indicator light will illuminate in a solid blue.![Blue Indicator Light for Cold Froth](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/DSC00648.BfKPpFes_1nJO78.webp) ### Usage - Decide if you want hot milk, hot milk with foam, or even cold milk with foam! - Add your favorite milk or half and half. - Put the pitcher on the base and put the lid on the pitcher - Press the button the correct number of times - About 2.5 to 3 minutes later, you have a superb result - Add coffee or espresso, or just add some caramel sauce for a wonderfully sweet, caffeine-free drink - Remove and rinse the whisk and then rinse and wipe inside (very easy due to having the entire whisk removable)![Frothing in Process](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/DSC00654.Dg-6JzHu_ZS5As8.webp)![Half and Half after Hot Froth](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/DSC00661.DMtDxfLd_jWoym.webp) ### Pros - 3 options for your milk (Hot Froth, Hot Milk, Cold Froth) - Foam quality and consistency are great - Operation is very easy, with clear button light feedback - The pitcher is cordless and has a solid base - Very Quiet Operation - 60-second cleanup is possible thanks to the non-stick interior and the ability to remove the whisk - 1 Year Warranty for both the USA and Canada ### Cons - A little slow at 2.5 to 3 minutes to complete a cycle - It would be nice if the base had a cord holder - Color selection may not complement every kitchen. Would love to see a Stainless Steel model, or at least a grey or black model without the bright color accents. - A little pricey at around $79-$99 street price depending on color, but is now my favorite milk frother, especially for those summer days when you want iced coffee with cold foamy milk! I really don’t think it gets much better than the Sherwood Electric Milk Frother. It does everything I could want, is well-built by a US-based company, and is relatively affordable. Highly recommended._* 2016 UPDATE: The LifStyl Milk Frother was discontinued._  ### Resources_Sherwood SMF-1000 Automatic Electric Milk Frother and Warmer (no longer available)__Disclosure: INeedCoffee was sent this product at no cost, which did not affect its review._ Published on July 17, 2014--- #### Chris Arnold Chris is the creator of Two Bit History.

# Simple BBQ Coffee Rub for Steaks, Pork, and More [Recipes](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/coffee-recipes/)---by [Chris Arnold](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/chris-arnold/)![Simple BBQ Coffee Rub for Steaks, Pork, and More](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/simple-bbq-coffee-rub-for-steaks-pork-and-more/simple-bbq-rub.jpg) Got a little leftover coffee? Consider using it for a rub on a Steak or Porkchop. Keep it simple and start with a decent cut of meat, and grind your coffee between espresso and drip. Just rub in the mixture right before throwing it on a hot grill. This will minimize moisture coming to the top, which can result in a soggy, rather than a dry crust.![bbq-coffee-rub](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/bbq-coffee-rub1.B7gkduaL_Z2uAxf1.webp)_BBQ Coffee Rub_![Coffee BBQ Rub on Meat](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/bbq-rub-on-meat.DUabcatZ_Z1TNJ2.webp)_Coffee BBQ Rub on Meat_ Also, let your meat sit at room temperature for 20-30 minutes. Putting a cold steak from the refrigerator directly on the grill will result in a cooler red center than you probably want. Keep in mind that you won’t see those nice grill marks since the dark color of the coffee will cover them up. Here are a couple of mixtures I use, but definitely feel free to experiment. ### Steak - 2 Tbsp Coffee (grind between espresso and drip) - 1 Tsp Cumin - 2 Tsp Sea Salt - 1 Tsp Coarsely Ground Black Pepper ### Pork - 2 Tbsp Coffee (grind between espresso and drip) - 1 Tbsp Brown Sugar - 1 Tsp Cinnamon - 2 Tsp Sea Salt - 1 Tsp Coarsely Ground Black Pepper![Grilled Top Sirloin with Coffee Rub](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/steak-cooked-with-coffee-rub.BLp6c9m-_lhCyX.webp)_Grilled Top Sirloin with Coffee Rub_### Resources [Coffee and Barbecue](https://ineedcoffee.com/coffee-and-barbecue/) – Coffee barbecue recipes include Squealin’ Good Wake-Me-Up Java Rub and Brown Eye Piggy Sauce.

# Sili-Dripper Silicone Collapsible Coffee Drip Brewer Review [Brewing Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/brewing-coffee/)---by [Chris Arnold](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/chris-arnold/)![Sili-Dripper Silicone Collapsible Coffee Drip Brewer Review](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/sili-dripper-silicone-collapsible-coffee-drip-brewer-review/DSC01069.jpg) ***UPDATE September 2020:** The Sili-Dripper is no longer available for sale. However, the GSI Outdoors Java Drip Collapsible mentioned is still available. * If you have ever wanted to make your own drip coffee while on travel or for a hiking/camping trip, you know that keeping the size of all the bits and pieces down to a minimum is key.  Most opt for a cone filter, fashioned after the Melitta style.  But they take up a fair amount of room and don’t pack down well. Enter the Sili-Dripper by OnticcoPD. It is an inexpensive, compact way to make coffee for one. It takes #2 size paper cone filters and collapses down into a little puck about 3/4 inches (2cm) thick by 4 inches (10cm) in diameter. The puck has a loop to attach a carabiner or keyring.![DSC01066](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/DSC01066.cj4YEouo_NgNaY.webp)![DSC01068](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/DSC01068.C-QTOtgh_Zrg23j.webp) The kit comes with a collapsible silicone dripper and an instruction sheet. The instruction sheet recommends using “boiling water”. Please don’t follow that advice. Depending on the altitude where boiling points may change, boil your water, and wait 30 seconds before pouring. Ideal temps for coffee brewing are between 195F-205F (90C-96C) and will minimize the chances of a sour or bitter result. Tim Johnson at OnticcoPD informed me he will be updating the instruction sheet in the future.![DSC01065](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/DSC01065.C5EXcsV0_1Ciqto.webp) There really isn’t much to the unit. You simply expand the unit, place it over a mug, put in your filter and coffee, and pour your hot water over and enjoy. I noticed that the filter tended to bunch up a bit once hot water was poured over the coffee grounds, but it wasn’t a big deal.![DSC01069](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/DSC01069.cOzuNC8K_2iMW3H.webp) There are a few things about the Sili Dripper I would like to see improved: - More support for the cone filter at the top, and a little better fit so that the filter doesn’t bunch up. - Another version uses a #4 size paper cone filter for more than one person. - A way to keep it covered and clean, especially when out hiking or camping. - The ability to control the brew time (think of a portable version of the [Clever Coffee Dripper](https://ineedcoffee.com/clever-coffee-dripper-review/ "Clever Coffee Dripper Review")). At under $10, the Sili-Dripper is a good value. If you want something with a larger capacity and an included cover, consider the GSI Outdoors Collapsible Java Drip for just a couple of bucks more. ### Resources_Sili-Dripper (No longer available for purchase)_ *GSI Outdoors Java Drip Collapsible Pourover Coffee Maker * Published on December 11, 2014--- #### Chris Arnold Chris is the creator of Two Bit History.

# Six Tips For Overcoming Coffee Addiction [Coffee and Health](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/coffee-health/)---by [David I](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/david-i/)![Six Tips For Overcoming Coffee Addiction](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/six-tips-for-overcoming-coffee-addiction/strong-tea1.jpg) How to Quit Drinking Coffee If you are like hundreds of thousands of people across the country, then you are struggling with an addiction to coffee and would like to kick the habit. Beating your Java addiction will not be easy and will probably take you several attempts. I had been drinking coffee since the age of 12 and finally kicked the habit twenty years later. To do this, I implemented a number of simple techniques, which you will learn here. ### #1 Have the right mental attitude If you are in the stages of just contemplating your desire to stop drinking coffee then the task in front of you might seem very daunting indeed. Perhaps you have tried to quit in the past and have failed. What you should keep in mind is that overcoming your addiction is possible as many people do it every day. In your quest to stop drinking coffee mind over matter applies greatly. ### #2 Avoid quitting cold turkey One technique that many people use to quit coffee is to simply stop drinking it all at once. I do not recommend this method. The reason is that you will have increased symptoms of withdrawal such as insomnia, anxiety, and headaches. Furthermore, you also run the risk of consuming too much coffee should you have a binge drinking session. ### #3 Cut back gradually If you drink five cups of coffee per day then you can start by cutting down to four. Once you get used to this level then try to cut down to three then two then one or zero. I like this method of cutting back slowly because it does not cause any shock to your system and you will suffer much less from the uncomfortable withdrawal symptoms. ### #4 Make a cup of weaker coffee There is nothing more delicious and invigorating than a nice cup of strong coffee in the morning. However, if you are looking to nip your coffee-drinking habit in the bud then one thing you can do is to add less coffee when preparing your cup. For example, if you are used to adding three tablespoons per cup then why not try adding two heaping tablespoons and gradually cut back from there. While your coffee will be weaker you can still maintain the taste to a certain degree by using high-quality coffee. ### #5 Stop buying coffee for your home Another great idea is to simply stop purchasing coffee when you go to the supermarket. By not bringing coffee into your home you will be in a much better position to overcome your addiction. One great idea is to stop drinking coffee at home but only drink it occasionally when you are outside with friends. The benefit to this is that you will appreciate your occasional cup of coffee much more than your regular morning cups. ### #6 Find good substitutes The morning cup of coffee is a cherished ritual for many people. There is nothing more comforting than sipping a hot beverage upon waking up. One thing that you can do is to find a good substitute. Many people use either fruit juice or tea as an alternative. One technique I knew to use daily is to prepare a cup of strong black tea with two Lipton tea bags. After I finish steeping the tea, I add two teaspoons of sugar and a generous amount of milk. The sugar and milk help ease the tea’s acidity and make it very delicious. Furthermore, I am still able to get my much-needed caffeine fix.![strong tea](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/strong-tea1.BA8zJDSj_1u9bc9.webp)_A strong tea made using 2 bags of Lipton_ I hope that you have found these suggestions for quitting drinking coffee helpful. You will discover that by quitting gradually and by finding good substitutions and only drinking coffee occasionally you will feel much healthier and happier.

# So, You Love Coffee, Right?? [Cafe Culture](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/cafe-culture/)---by [Mike Walton](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/mike-walton/)![So, You Love Coffee, Right??](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/so-you-love-coffee-right/cnn-mug1.jpg) Perhaps you’ve seen me. I’m the guy who stood in the coffee aisle, just standing there, hands in my pockets and my nose in the air smelling the different brands and smells of that part of the store. No, I’m NOT nuts and I have never been anywhere near an insane asylum. I don’t smoke anything, and I’m a very light social drinker. I’m just addicted to coffee…my only vice in this life. Since the age of ten, I have been drinking coffee. I started out by drinking my mom’s coffee after filling the cup with sugar and milk to create some kind of mocha chocolate milk drink. Later as I got older, I developed a taste for coffee with Coffeemate and sugar. Or with maple syrup. Or with Pet condensed milk. Since then, I have sampled coffees from several points around the world and have come to the conclusion that “there’s no such thing as strong coffee, only weak people.” Coffee has been my “Linus blanket” for me all through life; like the Peanuts character, I cannot go anywhere or do almost anything without having a container of coffee close by. This means that I bring a mug or cup of coffee to the bathroom with me; it waits patiently while I shower and shave before it is consumed. If a book or binder has a coffee stain on it, it probably belonged to me, for that’s my “mark.” I used to go through something to the effect of four pots of coffee a day. I cut back after my cardiologist said that my poor body has taken all of the caffeine it can take for a grown man – at 38 years of age. I resisted his plea for me to stop drinking coffee altogether, though. I still drink my fair share – and probably yours too – on a given day. Not four pots, though. Those days are over and done with. I’m down to two and a half now. I will drink coffee on the hottest of days and in the coldest of nights. I will drink it cold, with ice cubes, or steaming hot. Cold coffee “icks” people out normally, but not me; and I’ve had my share of small critters swimming around in my coffee cup or mug…the victims of the sweet smell and the hot liquid. I accidentally swallowed an ant that didn’t survive. There were two in my cup…I thought they were coffee grounds at first until I looked closely. It was too late… One, along with the swallow of coffee was already down into my tummy. I did find a fly once in my coffee…that’s when I said it’s time to toss it – fly and all – wash the mug and start over. I love “starting over”, for that usually means that I must make a new pot of coffee and have that great coffee scent waft through the house, campground, or kitchen. My favorite containers to drink coffee out of or through are stainless steel or aluminum mugs or cups. Next to that come the plastic containers normally used for cola drinks. Next to that comes two special glasses – glass mugs. A Boy Scouting leader and scientist sent me two beakers with handles. There are some 70 or so coffee mugs with various designs and logos — mostly scouting related — which adorn my “coffee cabinet”. I have two favorite coffee mugs: one of them I won during a contest sponsored by the Cable News Network (CNN) in which I needed to talk with Lou and Bobbie about the day’s news in order to win. The other is a large Kentucky Colonel coffee mug with my name on it. Of course, there are other coffee mugs sitting around, waiting their turn to be carried and used…but those two get the most “workouts.”![cnn mug](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/cnn-mug1.BqcZWcDk_NLJtY.webp)_Mike with his CNN coffee mug._ Someone suggested that I own stock in the companies owning Folgers and Maxwell House. I do now. So, if you see someone carting around a large coffee mug during a sporting event, or just out for a walk, you’ll know that’s me. Or if there’s a new flavor of coffee in the shop and there’s someone already in line to try it out, that’s me. Or if someone is aimlessly walking down the coffee aisle, not really looking for something, but just standing around with his hands in his pockets…that’s me. And remember…there’s no such thing as strong coffee. Only weak people.

# Shopping For the Coffee Fan [Cafe Culture](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/cafe-culture/)---by [Michael Allen Smith](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/michael-allen-smith/)![Shopping For the Coffee Fan](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/shopping-for-the-coffee-fan/aeropress1.jpg) This article may be like preaching to the choir since most of the visitors to this site know what they like about coffee. But if you are looking to shop for a coffee fan, this is just the primer you need to read for the holiday season. And for those of you who can’t articulate to your loved ones what constitutes a bad coffee present, forward them this URL. ### What To Buy? Some coffee drinkers aren’t picky and will enjoy anything with a caffeine molecule. However, most of us know what we like and what we despise. Many coffee drinkers hate Starbucks with a passion, and then there are many who prefer a darker roasted coffee a la Charbucks. Buying coffee for a coffee drinker is like baking cookies for Emeril Lagasse. Without inside information, you’ll probably fail. ### Things You Need to Know 1. Regular or decaf? 2. Flavored coffee or the real stuff? 3. What styles of roasts? What types of beans? 4. Do they grind their beans? 5. If not, how do they want their [beans ground](https://ineedcoffee.com/coffee-grind-chart/)? (drip, espresso, Turkish) And countless other things. All this nonsense leads you to one conclusion: Buy gift certificates! ### That’s No Fun The problem with gift certificates is that no matter how hard you try, you won’t be able to brew that piece of paper into a glorious pot of joe on the spot. But trust me, it is worth it. Try giving me flavored coffee from the mall and watch how hard I try to disguise a gag reflex. It’s not pretty. Those beans will be in the trash beside the fruit cake before your car leaves the driveway. ### Coffee Gear Now, we are getting somewhere. True coffee fans will usually aspire to some new coffee gadget. It could be a better grinder or a new brewing system. The article [Coffee Gear That Won’t Break The Bank](https://ineedcoffee.com/coffee-gear-that-wont-break-the-bank/) gives several ideas. At the $25 price range, an [Aeropress](https://ineedcoffee.com/aeropress-coffee-maker-tutorial/) makes for an excellent coffee gift. It serves as a great brewer and can also be taken into the office or even camping. ### Summary Unless you know EXACTLY what the coffee drinker on your Christmas list wants, don’t buy anything but a gift certificate or maybe coffee gear.

# Stagg Pour-Over Coffee Dripper Review and Tutorial [Brewing Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/brewing-coffee/)---by [Michael Allen Smith](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/michael-allen-smith/)![Stagg Pour-Over Coffee Dripper Review and Tutorial](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/stagg-pour-coffee-dripper-review-tutorial/stagg-pour-over-coffee-dripper.jpg) This month, I had the opportunity to try out another coffee brewer. The Stagg [X] Pour-Over Coffee Dripper by Fellow is a flat-bottom coffee brewer with custom filters. There is a larger model called the [XF]. When you go to purchase a Stagg, you can buy the Dripper Set, which includes a clear 10-ounce tasting glass. The coffee will brew directly into the glass. For this review and tutorial, I used the [X]. There are things I liked and didn’t like about the Stagg. Before I render a verdict, let’s make some coffee.![Stagg Dripper Holes](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/stagg-filter-holes.D_x8Wk5H_vBFgX.webp)_The Stagg Dripper is a flat-bottom pour-over with 10 tiny holes. In this photo, you are looking upside-down at the bottom of the dripper. I’ve added a US dime for scale._  ### The Equipment The photo below shows that the Stagg Dripper collapses into a small space, which is pretty sweet, especially if you wish to travel with it. I don’t have their 10-ounce tasting glass or carafe, so I found a small glass jar with markings on the side to let me see how much coffee has been brewed. At first, I tried brewing directly into a short drinking glass, but I found the Stagg dropped too far into the cup. Also, I wanted an easy way to measure the volume of brewed coffee. Thankfully, I found a small jar that tracked milliliters on the side. If you purchase the Kit version of the Stagg, you won’t need to deal with this as the glass fits the Stagg precisely and is the perfect volume.![Stagg Dripper start](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/stagg-start.BFzYBA1B_ZM0IsT.webp) Once you open the brewer, these are the parts you will have.![Stagg Dripper Parts](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/stagg-parts.Bgipqw0q_2w2JD5.webp)_Clockwise from the top left: the Stagg Coffee Dripper, glass jar (not included), Stagg [X] filter, funnel, and the bean measuring tray._  ### Measuring the Coffee Fellow designed the Stagg brewer to make coffee without needing to weigh anything. In the photo below, you will see a single dot and a double dot. When you fill coffee beans or grounds to the single dot line, you will have approximately 20 grams of coffee. The double dot is used to make larger batches.![Stagg Bean Line](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/stagg-bean-line.D9nHR6kq_1arIeE.webp)![Stagg Measure ](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/stagg-measure-beans.B6mkYJ19_1MWg6E.webp) ### Grinding the Coffee According to Fellow, the Stagg Coffee Dripper uses a [Medium Grind](https://ineedcoffee.com/coffee-grind-chart/). I found the grind size to be quite sensitive. My first brew was a little too fine, and the extraction took over five minutes. Then, I made the grind a little more coarse, and it brewed in under a minute, which was too fast. I advise using older coffee for the first few brews while discovering the ideal grind size. ## Brewing the Coffee ### #1 Place the Stagg Dripper over a container If you purchase the set, you will already have a perfectly sized vessel for the coffee to brew into. However, you will need to find an alternative if you don’t. The ideal container for the [X] model will be glass so you can see when to stop pouring. You could periodically lift the brewer to verify you aren’t overfilling. I just used a glass jar with measuring markers on the side for this tutorial. If you purchase the [XF], this is less of a concern because the chamber size is large enough to hold all the water needed for the brew cycle at once. With the [X], you must add water gradually during the brew cycle. ### #2 Add Filter and Rinse The Stagg Dripper uses a custom filter. There are two sizes: one for the [X] and a taller one for the [XF]. Place the filter in the brewer, rinse with hot water, and throw out the rinse water. ### #3 Use the Funnel to Add Ground Coffee The Stagg Dripper includes a funnel. Place it over the coffee filter. This is optional, but it will make guiding all the coffee grounds into the filter easier.![Stagg Pour Over Funnel](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/stagg-pour-over-grounds-in.9rGKXKYp_eKuDO.webp)_Using the included funnel makes adding coffee grounds much easier._### #4 Pour Hot Water Heat water to 200°F. Pour enough hot water to cover all the coffee grounds. Then, wait 30 seconds. This is the bloom.![Stagg Bloom Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/stagg-bloom-coffee.BGjIdk9D_1FFk6L.webp) The next step will depend on whether you have an [X] or [XF] model. If you have an [XF], fill the chamber to the top with hot water and wait for your coffee to complete brewing. If you have an [X], you will need to keep track of how much water you add so that you do not under or overpour. You are aiming for 10 ounces of brewed coffee. It should take about 2 minutes for the coffee to brew in the second phase of the pour. If it brews too slowly, use a more coarse grind size. If it is too fast, use a finer grind size.![STagg Pour Over Water](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/stagg-fill-up.BS-HXVdW_rAUUp.webp) ### #5 Remove and Enjoy Once all water has passed through the filter, remove the Stagg and enjoy. You can even place the Stagg onto the bean tray to catch drips. Cleanup is as simple as it gets. Put the coffee grounds into compost and rinse everything else. ### Is the Stagg Dripper Worth Buying? At the time of this review, the Fellow Stagg [X] Dripper Set is $70 USD. That is a bit pricey for a pour-over device. The Stagg is well-built and does an excellent job holding heat. If you want something you can take camping, check it out. I don’t go camping, so I need to compare it against other indoor pour-over methods. Although the coffee tasted great once I got the grind perfect, it wasn’t any better than a Kalita Wave, another flat-bottom pour-over brewer. And the Kalita is more affordable at $25 USD. I thought I wouldn’t like the single dot, but it is a clever solution for measuring coffee without carrying a scale or spoons. If I were to redesign this part, I’d probably make it a bit more visible so it stood out more in low-light situations. The Stagg Brewer kit ships with 15 filters. Afterward, you will need to buy the custom filters on their website. Forty-five filters cost $5 for the [X] and $8 for the [XF] plus shipping. That works out to 11 cents per filter for the [X] and 18 cents for the [XF] before shipping costs. With the Kalita Wave, you can get filters for 6 or 7 cents each in bulk on Amazon or eBay. Should you get a Stagg Pour Over? If you need something extremely well-built that does an excellent job holding heat and you don’t mind paying more for the brewer and the filters, consider the Stagg. However, if you want a flat-bottom kitchen pour-over device and don’t want to spend as much money, check out the Kalita Wave. ### Resources [Kalita Wave Coffee Brewing Tutorial](https://ineedcoffee.com/kalita-wave-coffee-brewing-tutorial/) – INeedCoffee brewing tutorial [Coffee Brewing Guide](https://ineedcoffee.com/coffee-brewing-guide/) – Our guide includes several different pour-over tutorials.

# Stovetop Espresso Brewing Tutorial [Espresso](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/espresso/)---by [Michael Allen Smith](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/michael-allen-smith/)![Stovetop Espresso Brewing Tutorial](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/stovetop-espresso-brewing-tutorial/stovetop-espresso-brewing-tutorial.jpg) This is a quick tutorial on the stovetop espresso maker, also known as a Moka Pot and sold under the name _Bialetti_. Let’s get started. ### #1 Fill the Bottom Chamber with Water Fill the bottom chamber with cold water. Stumptown Coffee advises pre-heating the water, so the coffee doesn’t cook on the stove. It may be a good idea to use the large 6-cup Bialetti, but I found that with the 3-cup maker, it made no difference to the taste and was more of a hassle. Try both ways and do whatever works best for you.![fill bialetti with water](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/fill-bialetti-with-water.CEqXJgnJ_VYDkY.webp)_Fill the lower chamber of the Bialetti with water._### #2 Add Ground Coffee to Filter Add ground coffee to the filter. There is some debate on how fine the grind should be. I use a grind that is finer than drip but a little coarser than an espresso grind. Do not pack the filter. Like regular espresso, I level the grinds with my finger and wipe off any loose grounds. Once the coffee is loaded into the filter, place it into the bottom chamber. You could load the filter first and then add the ground coffee. Either way is fine. If you make Stovetop Espresso regularly, consider getting a [Moka Pot Coffee Dispenser](https://ineedcoffee.com/moka-pot-coffee-dispenser-review/).![add coffee to stovetop espresso](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/add-coffee-to-stovetop-espresso.BH7nvqde_zWvEk.webp)_Add ground coffee to the filter._### #3 Secure the Top and Bottom Chambers Together Twist the top and bottom chambers together until a tight seal is made. Failure to secure the two chambers fully could result in a failed brew and potentially having to clean up a mess.![Seal the top and and bottom chambers together](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/seal-espresso-maker.DxnxybJw_Z5HI57.webp)_Seal the top and bottom chambers together._### #4 Place Coffee Maker onto Stove Place the stovetop maker onto the stove and turn on the heat. A low flame is enough to do the job. You could also take it outdoors with you and use a campfire.![Heat the Stovetop Espresso Maker](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/add-heat-espresso-maker.Caxgm5Ma_1Cb6cW.webp)_Heat the Stovetop Espresso Maker_### #5 When the Coffee Finishes Brewing, Remove it From Heat and Serve When the coffee has completed the brew cycle and is in the top chamber, turn off the heat and serve it. Below are some photos showing a brew cycle in progress. Ideally, you would want to keep the lid down during brewing.![espresso before extraction](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/espresso-before-extraction.BLgcvKjp_ZPo2gT.webp)_Before Extraction_![espresso during extraction](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/espresso-during-extraction.a0T0nWTH_Z1UQzEL.webp)_During Extraction_![espresso after extraction](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/espresso-after-extraction.CL6DRkha_2eELfD.webp)_After Extraction_### #6 Cool Before You Clean Allow your stovetop espresso maker time to cool before you break it down for cleaning.

# Soy Good, for Decaf [Cafe Culture](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/cafe-culture/)---by [Laura K Baker](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/laura-k-baker/)![Soy Good, for Decaf](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/soy-good-for-decaf/cafe-weekend-seattle1.jpg) So I happened upon a new form of disguise this weekend. A new method of both up-ing the tastiness of generally blah-to-icky decaf coffee and also hiding a little of the decaf-self-loathing I carry around. Decaf soy latte. This is my latest strategy to keep the coffee flowing. In my fully caffeinated coffee days, I enjoyed just as many cups of piping-hot drip coffee as I did specialty drinks. But as a decaf drinker, a straight cup of the stuff is almost more than I can bear. So my drink of choice is the following: decaf mocha with skim milk, and skip the whipped cream. You can see why I am embarrassed when I order. “Why bother?” should be the name of my personal drink. But the chocolate factor has been quite helpful in making decaf more bearable for me. And, quite honestly, skim milk is less of a health factor and more of a taste one; I’ve found that skim milk allows the chocolate flavor to be more prominent. The lack of whipped cream is just a personal preference; I don’t really like the stuff. Plus, this is a cup of coffee, not an ice cream sundae. But as I was visiting Atlanta this weekend, I frequented a great little place called _Java Monkey_, situated in the Decatur square. Their coffee is fair trade, organic, and served up by friendly, knowledgeable baristas, often with surprisingly well-placed piercings and a handy tip or two on the happenings in the area.![Cafe Weekend, Seattle](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/cafe-weekend-seattle1.C3bp_Gp-_1cPEGf.webp)_Cafe Weekend, Seattle_ For some reason, that particular morning I felt a little less comfortable ordering my overly-specified-yuppy-drink, perhaps because of the very nice, slightly bohemian wait staff. So I pondered how to scale down. A regular latte, I’ve found, really doesn’t hide the gunky feeling often left in my mouth after a sip of decaf. But I thought of my daughter, who drinks exclusively soy milk. Soy milk – hmm. “Decaf soy latte, for here,” I ordered. I liked the sound of that — it rolled off the tongue much easier, and the barista didn’t seem strained to understand what I wanted. The result was more than I had hoped for: a strong cup of coffee, creamy from the full-fat soy milk, but with a bit of masking, due either to the vanilla flavoring found in many soy milks or simply from the very particular flavor of soy milk itself. (At Java Monkey, they are also quite accomplished in creating that cute cream leaf drawn through the top of the latte foam, making the drinking experience all the more pleasant.) And so, my latest decaf drink of choice is a bit simplified, fairly yummy, and hopefully a step forward in increasing my coffee self-esteem. Published on August 16, 2009--- #### Laura K Baker Laura is a freelance writer, and a mother. She also has a Ph.D. in American literature… and you can bet your double-shot espresso she didn’t drink decaf during her grad school years.

# Spanish Coffee [Recipes](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/coffee-recipes/)---by [Marketman](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/marketman/)![Spanish Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/spanish-coffee/cancun-mexico1.jpg) “Spanish coffee” is essentially a mix of hard liquor, coffee, and heavy whipped cream. The preparation and presentation can be simple or an entertaining show of fire. In Austin, Texas, several bars serve a simple form of Spanish coffee composed of a shot of brandy on the bottom, black coffee in the middle, and whipped cream on the top. The best presentation of “Spanish coffee” I have seen was at a resort in Cancun. Its sometimes referred to as “Mayan coffee” or “Flaming coffee”. The ingredient list consisted of the following: - A shot of Rum - A shot of Brandy - Coffee - A dash of cinnamon and nutmeg - Sugar - Heavy cream - Tablespoon of Kaluha - Lime wedge - Whole orange for pouring Brandy![cancun mexico](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/cancun-mexico1.CxS6xL5S_Zchkcl.webp)_[Cancun at Sunset](http://www.flickr.com/photos/flem007_uk/2935138064/in/photostream/) by Mike Fleming_ Some preparation is necessary. An un-ripened orange is peeled in a corkscrew fashion. Glass mugs are used for the coffee, and prepared by being dipped first in lime wedges, and then in sugar, to coat the rims. An ounce of Rum is added to each mug. An ounce of Brandy is added to each glass next, but not without a show. The Brandy is added to one of two stainless-steel pouring containers. The Brandy is then lit on fire, and the flaming alcohol is poured back and forth several times, and then it is distributed in equal amounts to each of the coffee mugs. The other half of the flaming Brandy is saved for later. A mixture of cinnamon and nutmeg is then shaken into each container, which causes sparks to fly from the still-flaming brandy. Coffee is then poured into each mug, which should extinguish the flames. A spoonful of heavy cream is then added to each container. The remaining Brandy goes on last, but not without another fiery show. The remaining flaming Brandy is now poured down and around the corkscrew of the orange that was peeled in the first stage. Cut-up lime wedges are then placed on each serving plate. The mugs are then placed on the serving plates with the lime wedges. A flaming tablespoon of Kahlua is set on top of each drink. Finally, the lime wedge is squeezed onto the flame just before serving, aggravating and then extinguishing the final flame just before consumption. It’s a magnificent presentation! [Spanish Coffee in Cancun, Mexico](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_uwtHpOWEc) (YouTube 3 minutes) Spanish coffee is not the only popular liquor-and-caffeine drink. Liquor and caffeine go especially well together at ski resorts everywhere. After a cold and wet day of skiing, many people crave coffee with a shot of Kahlua. Another popular drink is the “hot toddy.” There are many variations, but the best one I’ve seen and tasted is a mix of hot black tea, one tablespoon of honey, a wedge of lemon, and a shot of whiskey. French liquor is a great way to go for high-end caffeine and alcohol mixtures. “Blueberry tea” is a pleasant mixture of black tea and one-ounce shots of both Amaretto and Grand Marnier. For a more soothing drink, try a mix of chamomile tea and Chartreuse. Published on January 1, 2009--- #### Marketman Marketman is a full time investor, trader and entrepreneur.

# Spicing It Up [Brewing Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/brewing-coffee/)---by [CB Miller](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/cb-miller/)![Spicing It Up](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/spicing-it-up/coffee-syrups.jpg) We don’t usually advocate messing with a good thing, i.e. adding flavors to an already great-tasting coffee. But occasionally, it is fun to try new things and some people actually prefer flavors in their coffee. Our advice to you is simply, to do it properly so as to not ruin a perfectly good cup of coffee. The first thing we want to do is strongly dissuade people from buying pre-flavored coffee. On top of the list of problems is the fact that they permanently stain your coffee-making equipment with their scents. Pre-flavored coffee is not flavored with syrups but with very powerful oils. Avoid them at all costs. Other problems exist, but that is not the purpose of this article. That being said, let’s talk about the next most common way of flavoring coffee; syrups. Syrups work great. They come in a wide variety of flavors and are easy to use. The bad thing about syrups is that they are difficult to find. When you do find them, you have to buy large bottles of them. But don’t worry, there are alternatives, such as natural spices and fruits. This is the method we recommend.![](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/coffee-syrups.DM8cGVY0_mzO3G.webp)_[Sunny Syrups](https://www.flickr.com/photos/sea-turtle/3210374156/in/photostream/) by sea turtle_ Traditionally (meaning in practice for many years throughout the world) spices have been brewed right in with the coffee. Flavorings are merely added to the grounds before you brew. Some examples of flavorings used this way are cinnamon, nutmeg, nuts, and orange zest. Just grind them and add them to the coffee grounds. These spices are gentle and won’t permanently stain your equipment with smells. You’ll have to experiment to find how much you like but that is part of the fun. Other flavors that are easy to add post brewing are vanilla extract, chocolate, mint flavoring or almost any kind of liquor is nice. Add extracts and liquids after you brew to avoid any problems with staining your coffee pot. Use common sense when adding flavorings. Don’t add too much flavoring, because you still want to enjoy the original coffee taste. And it is important to keep in mind what type of coffee you are using. For example, almost any flavoring will work well in a nice balanced Central American coffee. However, in a heavy Indonesian coffee, you may only want to try flavors that will complement the rich thick body, such as chocolate or liquor. Have fun, and try to remember to use flavors like you would perfume or cologne. You only need a hint to add a little mystery and intrigue, too much and it will overpower your senses. Published on December 1, 2000--- #### CB Miller Small coffee roasters are perking up all over the country, recreating styles and blends which were nearly impossible to find just a few years ago. The quality of these blends remains unparalleled by those of the giant coffee companies. However, it is difficult to experience these wonderfully fresh roasted coffees because the roasters are scattered all over the country.

# Starbucking – Honest Artistry [Cafe Culture](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/cafe-culture/)---by [Alex Scofield](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/alex-scofield/)![Starbucking – Honest Artistry](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/starbucking-honest-artistry/dvd-starbucking-winter1.jpg) > _Standing on the shoulders of giants leaves me cold. I need an idea to call my own._ – R.E.M. As it turns out, the orchestrated joy of the 1998 Mark McGwire/Sammy Sosa single-season home run record chase was the exception. Pursuit of a pioneering feat is probably more often like the 2007 Barry Bonds countdown to the career home-run record – the feat is impressive, but it’s come at a steep cost, and there’s a dark and visible undercurrent to the entire record-breaking process. Think of the records in the Guinness Book, both the mainstream ones as well as the freaky ones. The world’s longest fingernails? The longest flagpole-sitting session? The longest case of hiccups? The fastest marathon time? Odds are that the record holder suffered greatly to achieve this _immortality,_ both in training for the feat and in its accomplishment.![DVD starbucking winter](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/dvd-starbucking-winter1.CXcH82tZ_NOJaC.webp) In the most memorable scene in _Starbucking,_ Winter, the documentary’s subject, aims to break his record of 28 Starbucks cafes visited in one day. Under Winter’s own rules, he must drink at least one 4-ounce coffee at each Starbucks he hits. It is absolutely gut-wrenching to watch Winter close in Number 29. He retches. He dry-heaves. He’s even more jittery than usual. He complains of a headache, and it’s easy to believe that it’s pretty awful. It spurs as visceral a reaction as the puke finale of the _Super Size Me_ chowdown. And Winter carries on. He has a record to beat, and a limited amount of time before the last one closes for the day. Welcome to _Starbucking,_ a documentary by rookie director Bill Tangeman that follows Winter’s obsessive mission to visit every Starbucks in the world. Winter exists. He’s been on his mission for 10 years, and it’s described in exhaustive detail on his website, [StarbucksEverywhere.net](http://StarbucksEverywhere.net). It’s safe to assume Winter is already the individual record holder for most Starbucks visited. He’s not done yet, either. As of 2007, Winter still aims to visit every standalone Starbucks in North America, and he’s been to more than 7,000 (or 97 percent) of them. ### Your Point, Please? So what’s the damn point? That’s what Tangeman wondered when he first heard about Winter in 2004. Why would somebody pursue such a seemingly trivial goal with so much tenacity? This is the essence of _Starbucking_ – Winter’s singular, all-encompassing obsession with accomplishing a unique goal, one that may or may not be worth the effort and blood price it requires. Winter’s dates and girlfriends come and go, put off eventually by being second-fiddle to his Starbucking obsession – we hear from a couple of them in _Starbucking._ Winter’s willing to pay the price. That’s why he’s also willing to freebase coffee that spilled in his car’s cupholder – okay, he’s actually drinking with his mouth through a straw, but it looks as base and illicit as a coke hit. These are Winter’s rules, though. It’s either that or turn around and go back to the Starbucks where he got it, now miles away in the rear-view mirror. His visit doesn’t count unless he drinks the coffee, right? ### Caffeine Highs and Lows Is Winter’s mission worth its cost? Winter himself seems up-and-down on this question in the documentary. In some scenes, he takes obvious pride in living a life different from the rest of the crowd. Nobody, not even Starbucks CEO Jim Donald, has likely done what Winter has done. Most folks stay rooted in their jobs and the area where they grew up. Winter takes short-term programming jobs, sees them through, then he’s back in his car to knock a few dozen more Starbuckses off his life list. “You cannot imagine how much I love this, just being out on the road, driving from city to city,” Winter says. He expresses similar sentiments in an [INeedCoffee article he wrote](https://ineedcoffee.com/seeing-the-world-one-starbucks-at-a-time/), stressing the once-in-a-lifetime sights he’s seen on his road trips. Tangeman captures some of these sights, too, like a sequence of approaches toward some of America’s great cities. The skylines are an uplifting rush. They’re juxtaposed, however, by a scene of Winter sprinting across the street toward a Starbucks in Anywhere, USA. The chain-franchise experience gnaws away at a town’s individuality. In other scenes, Winter dwells on his own insignificance and the futility of his chase, likely during times when the caffeine buzz runs low. When asked how he compares to Lewis and Clark, Winter says, with a despondent look on his face, “What they were doing is truly important. …What I am doing is not.” In yet other times, Winter seems to feel trapped by his own scheme. Many people can’t buck inertia; Winter can’t buck momentum. Several hundred Starbucks visits after he first came up with the idea, says Winter, “I was too far into it to quit.” He also says, “It got old a long time ago, but a goal is a goal.” He started this mission, and he considers it past the time where he can second-guess the worth of his endeavor. ### Warts Included Nobody in their right mind would accuse _Starbucking_ of being an ad for Starbucks. Winter’s dry-heaving doesn’t exactly make one want to run out for a Venti Coffee of the Day. Neither does a hometown friend’s claim that Winter’s skin smells like Starbucks coffee. The same goes for the film’s treatment of Winter, who receives 25 percent of the profits from _Starbucking,_ yet this doesn’t come across as an “approved” documentary. While this is Winter’s stage, it reveals all his warts, shortcomings, and neuroses. Students in an Abnormal Psychology college course take turns speculating as to what psychiatric disorders afflict Winter. Winter, to his everlasting credit, doesn’t seem to give a damn. He’s amused when told about the psychoanalyses. Plenty of people think Winter’s insane, and this isn’t lost on him. Just like his website links to almost anything written about him, positive or negative, Winter is content to receive the attention. Ah yes, the attention. There’s definitely an air of Reality TV to _Starbucking._ Winter describes himself as a “minor celebrity,” probably accurate, a status that puts him on par with a typical Reality TV “star.” Molehills sometimes become mountains. Winter’s travels entail tons of driving on interstate highways and tons of time spent in chain cafes – standout moments are few, scattered, and milked for all they’re worth. Those who loathe the Reality genre probably won’t have much love for _Starbucking._### Conclusion Whatever one thinks of the Winter and his Starbucks mission, Tangeman uses what’s at his disposal to tell a story. He does so artfully. _Starbucking_ is neither a hatchet job nor a puff piece – in other words, it’s a good, honest documentary, simultaneously sympathetic and unsparing in its treatment of Winter. Is Winter a pioneer of 21st-century chain-store culture or an inconsequential attention hound? Tangeman leaves the viewer free to decide. ### Resources [Seeing the World One Starbucks at a Time](https://ineedcoffee.com/seeing-the-world-one-starbucks-at-a-time/) [Winter: Coffee Achiever 2.0](https://ineedcoffee.com/winter-coffee-achiever-2-0/) [Winter: Coffee Achiever](https://ineedcoffee.com/winter-coffee-achiever/) Published on July 1, 2007--- #### Alex Scofield Alex Scofield is a freelance writer who lives in Cape Cod, Mass.

# Starbucks Coffee College [Coffee Business](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/coffee-business/)---by [Michael Allen Smith](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/michael-allen-smith/)![Starbucks Coffee College](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/starbucks-coffee-college/starbucks-coffee-college-degree.jpg)_This post was originally written in May 2010._ One of the perks of running a coffee website is that I will occasionally get invited to coffee-related events. Being in Seattle helps, too. Most are for new coffee offerings and product launches. This spring, I received the most interesting invitation to date: Starbucks was inviting me to attend a two-day Coffee College. I am not exactly known for being a Starbucks fan, but I am also not a hater. My position on Starbucks is that it was part of my coffee journey years ago, but I’ve moved on to better quality. I prefer espresso to regular coffee and prefer lighter roasters over darker ones. That is why I only visit Starbucks when [far away](https://criticalmas.org/2010/05/sleepy-starbucks-and-caffeinated-sins-in-phuket-thailand/) from Seattle. Although several friends encouraged me to wear my Charbucks shirt, I was respectful of my host and kept it at home. When I accepted the offer to attend _Starbucks Coffee College_, I decided I would not let my past Starbucks experiences cloud my judgment. It was time to listen and learn. I was going back to college.![Charbucks shirt](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/charbucks-shirt1.Bu1el6fW_2tCUTz.webp)_I decided not to wear my Charbucks shirt at Starbucks Coffee College._### Day 1 – Pike Place Market and First and Pike Nine web-based writers from the United States, Guatemala, and South Korea attended Coffee College. I was the only student from the Seattle area. Our first class was visiting the “original” Starbucks store in the Pike Place Market. Here, we learned about the Pike Place Special Reserve Blend, which is only available at this location. If you thought the Pike Place Blend was over-roasted, stay away from the Special Reserve. It is even darker.![original starbucks](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/original-starbucks.DW5X0ELU_Z1dgItI.webp)_This is the “original” Starbucks, located at 1912 Pike Place. I put “original” in quotes because this store was relocated from 2000 Western Ave. So, depending on how you score things, this is either the “original” or sixth Starbucks location._ We walked to the new Starbucks Heritage store at 1st and Pike. The Pike Place location was described as the past, and the Heritage was described as the future. Our class learned that the store was LEED-certified and that many of the building materials were recycled. This was good stuff, but what I really cared about was the Clover Coffee machine. The $11,000 Clover Coffee machine is a fancy single-cup coffee brewer that makes a super clean and rich cup of coffee. It uses vacuum-pot technology combined with a 70-micron filter. The brewing temperature is set to 202 degrees, and the brewing time varies between 35 and 45 seconds. It takes 50 grams of coffee grounds to make a 16-ounce coffee.![2 Clover Coffee Machines](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/clover-coffee-machines.aZUqDlPl_Z1Lhcrd.webp)_Two Clover Coffee machines at the Starbucks Heritage Store on 1st and Pike._ I’ve had Clover Coffee many times before from Seattle and [Vancouver](https://criticalmas.org/2012/06/vancouver-espresso-vacation/) independent coffee shops. It makes a good cup of coffee. Could Starbucks make me a cup of coffee that equaled or exceeded my prior experiences? I weakly lobbied for them to make the Ethiopian Sun-Dried Yirgacheffe, as I thought their offering would best shine in a Clover machine, but they picked the Pike Place Special Reserve and 100% Kona. The Pike Place Special Reserve had no flavor. Bland. The Clover cleaned up the bitterness in the regular Pike Place Blend. The 100% Kona was a letdown as well. Island coffees should be full of flavor. Nothing was shining through on this coffee. Recently, I home-roasted some Kona from INeedCoffee contributor Gary Strawn’s Kona Earth farm, which was way better than this. Coffee College was getting off to a rough start. ### Day 1 – Starbucks Headquarters From downtown, we went to the Starbucks HQ. There, we did some coffee cupping. The five coffees on the table were: 1. Guatemala Casi Cielo 2. Ethiopian Sidamo 3. Ethiopian Sun-Dried Yirgacheffe 4. Sumatra 5. Gold Coast Blend The coffee used in cuppings tends to be from smaller batch roasts and is roasted lighter. The class learned that the flavor is more pronounced with lighter roasts. The cuppers taste the lighter roasts, and the public gets the dark stuff. Now their idea of lighter roasted is still dark by Stumptown standards, however, I did find both the Yirgacheffe and Sumatra to be decent coffees. The Guatemala and Sidamo were bland. Because INeedCoffee is family-friendly, I won’t tell you how bad I thought the Gold Coast Blend was.![Starbucks Coffee cupping room](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/coffee-cupping-table.BmIHotpz_C0PBW.webp)_Starbucks Coffee cupping room_ So far, I have just been discussing the quality of coffee, of which I am not a fan. I want to pause to say that while Starbucks could learn to make espresso from the third-wave coffee shops, _some_ indie coffee shops could learn how to be nicer to new customers from Starbucks. **Throughout the 2 days, I met many great people in the Starbucks organization. Extremely nice and passionate about coffee.** On a wall at the headquarters building, there were a bunch of hand-written goals from several store managers. One jumped out at me. It said: > To make a new customer feel like a regular during peak. I think Starbucks excels at this. They are excellent at recruiting first-time coffee drinkers and those new to espresso-based drinks. They are patient with their customers and really believe in their products. Burning coffee didn’t make Starbucks successful; customer service did. ### Day 1 – Farming Presentation, Blending and a Coffee Celebrity After lunch, we received an excellent overview of coffee from the agriculture side. Peter Torrebiarte started with where coffee is grown and how it is processed. Also covered was how Starbucks helps farmers by facilitating trading best practices information through Farmer Support Centers and Coffee and Farmer Equity (C.A.F.E.) Practices. Over 80% of the coffee Starbucks purchases comes from Latin America. They pay, on average, between $1.47 and $1.50 per pound of green coffee (freight on board). After the Coffee Basics class, we did a coffee cupping lab focused on blending. During the discussion, the door to the room opened, and in walked Starbucks CEO Howard Shultz. He chatted with us for a few minutes, and we learned his favorite coffee is Aged Sumatra. It isn’t every day that you meet a billionaire. ### Day 1 – Coffee Pairing Dinner The highlight of Coffee College was being taken to a special room at Tom Douglas’ Palace Kitchen for a five-course meal. Tom Douglas is a top chef in Seattle and even won on the TV show Iron Chef. The focus of the meal was matching coffee flavors with different courses. Each course was served with a distinct coffee. Palace Kitchen built a custom menu from the coffee cupping notes. This is where I confess that I never drink coffee with food and that I am highly skeptical that a coffee pairing could bring out more flavors than if both were consumed separately. It may work for wine, but coffee? Here are the four courses and the coffee that was paired with them. 1. Guatemala Casi Cielo – Slow-braised Oregon rabbit with guajillo peppers, orange-scented corn cake, and wood-grilled peppers. 2. Ethiopia Sidamo and Ethiopia Yirgacheffe – Seared Hudson Valley foie gras with Theo’s cocoa nibs and sour grape jelly. 3. Sumatra – Wood grilled bavette steak with fried jojos and bearnaise. 4. Gold Coast – Irish stout cake with black and tan ice cream and chocolate ganache. The Guatemala and both Ethiopians did nothing to help the delicious food served beside them. In fact, they took away from the food. The Sumatra surprised me. It did compliment the steak. Many of my fellow students felt the same way. You already know what I think of the Gold Coast Blend. ### Day 2 – Headquarters We began the day with the Barista Basics class. Inside Starbucks Headquarters is a cafe replica used for training and educational films. Although an amazing feat of engineering, the fully automatic espresso machine does not make a decent espresso. With a good grinder, I could get a more flavorful shot of coffee using a $25 Aeropress and my home-roasted coffee. The milk frothing on the machine was impressive, but I rarely drink milk.![Starbucks training room](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/starbucks-auto-espresso.CMfezg09_Z2upje3.webp)_Behind the espresso machine at the Starbucks training room._### Day 2 – Coffee Roasting Facility Inside headquarters, there is a _small_ roasting operation. Their _small_ roaster can roast 80-100 pounds of coffee at once. This is a lot compared to artisan micro-roasters, but nothing compared to their 1,000+ pound roaster in Kent, Washington. We got a roasting demonstration at the roasting facility.![Starbucks Pilot roaster](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/pilot-roaster.BVPZ2e_Y_Z1eOCKw.webp)_Starbucks Pilot roaster at corporate headquarters_ The day before, one of our instructors said that a coffee roast takes between 9 and 12 minutes. Now, I am certainly no expert when it comes to roasting, but I do have 12 years of experience in home roasting. To me, this seems fast, especially given the darker nature of the beans. Two of my favorite local roasters have longer roast times and lighter beans. The flavors are much more pronounced. The coffee roast demonstration we got was for a Guatemalan, taken a _little darker_. **Make it stop. How about a little lighter?** I’d like to actually taste the coffee. The roaster was a super nice guy with 18 years of experience. I won’t say the Starbucks roasting style is wrong; it is just not what I like. ### Day 2 – Headquarters Before breaking for lunch, we received a presentation on the VIA Ready Brew coffee. They don’t like to use the term instant coffee, but it is instant coffee. Last year, I tried the Colombia VIA and was impressed. It would make a decent cup of coffee while traveling. Unfortunately, they shared the Italian Roast VIA with us, which is charcoal-flavored hot water. ### Day 2 – Roy Street Coffee and Commencement In 2009, Starbucks opened two concept stores in Seattle. I had been to [15th Avenue Coffee and Tea](https://criticalmas.org/2009/08/15th-avenue-coffee-and-tea-first-impressions/) but had yet to visit Roy Street. Roy Street is a great-looking coffee shop, and its manager is a highly personable and great host. They served us lunch from a menu they designed, which is unavailable at any other store. It was much better food than is typically served in a normal Starbucks. But, honestly, all I care about is espresso. **If I were to have a positive coffee experience during my Starbucks Coffee College, it would have to be from Roy Street.**![Roy Street Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/roy-street-coffee.CIPIqXlF_2h3Vm7.webp)_Roy Street Coffee is at 700 Broadway East, Seattle, WA_ I ordered a single-origin espresso that used their Mexican Shade Grown coffee. Unlike other Starbucks stores, this drink would not be made using a super-automatic machine. The shot would be pulled from a Synesso espresso machine. My shot was ground at the time I ordered. The barista dialed in the shot, and I was handed an espresso in a ceramic cup (not paper). It was excellent. It has tons of flavor and is every bit equal to other single-origin espresso shots I’ve had from independent coffee shops in Seattle. Roy Street delivered. **If you want to see Starbucks at its best, visit Roy Street Coffee and Tea.**![espresso Roy Street Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/espresso-roy-street.CgmCFObS_13Q98z.webp)_My espresso from Roy Street Coffee._ Starbucks Coffee College concluded with a graduation ceremony. My fellow students and I each received a green Starbucks apron and a diploma. It was a great experience, and although I am not their ideal customer, I am thankful they invited me to participate.![Starbucks Coffee College degree](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/starbucks-coffee-college-degree.fNSI0f6a_ZFAk8t.webp) ### Sources [The History of Instant Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/the-history-of-instant-coffee/) – INeedCoffee article covering the origins of instant coffee.

# Starbucks World [Cafe Culture](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/cafe-culture/)---by [Devin Page](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/devin-page/)![Starbucks World](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/starbucks-world/starbucks-thailand1.jpg)_Starbucks is definitely going to take over the world_. This joke is becoming increasingly popular throughout the country, and with good reason. Although it may be a slight exaggeration of the truth, it has an eerie sense of foreshadowing to it. It is pretty unlikely that we will one day be living in the United States of Starbucks, but with the enormous amount of growth and the corporation’s rise in popularity, I think it’s important that we step back and ask ourselves, “why do we love it so much?” Starbucks offers a solution to a serious and growing need that is found throughout the world, and no, that need is not caffeine addiction, it is simply the need to relax. All Starbucks locations are the same. They offer the same drinks, but more importantly, there is always a calm, almost religious happiness that surrounds the industrial coffee makers and earthy-toned pictures that make up the interior decor. There is bound to be at least one couple talking and giggling and one or two men in business suits sitting by themselves with their eyes closed wishing they didn’t have to leave and return to their five-by-six cubicles. This escape is what makes Starbucks so popular. In fact, it is so popular that during 2004 three new locations were opened every day.![Starbucks - Chiang Mai, Thailand ](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/starbucks-thailand1.1_M4Z5VD_Z1gg2lS.webp)_Starbucks – Chiang Mai, Thailand by INeedCoffee_ A Starbucks is a place where people of all walks of life can come together on equal terms. They strive to create a haven against stereotypes and racism. This is evident when you look at the company’s own mission statement. The mission statement (if a major corporation can have one other than “we want money”) is based on six principles. Out of these six principles, only one is related to coffee. The other five deal with things like “embracing diversity” and “treat each other with respect.” This reaffirms the conscious attempt to connect with their customers on an emotional (even quazi-spiritual) level. Some may argue that they are devoted only to the great coffee, but that is not likely. Take for example the most hardcore of coffee addicts, the group that is willing to spend $4.50 three times a day on some exotic triple shot of espresso. Why? They may think they need the caffeine, but they are mistaken. Research shows that the darker the roast (espresso being the darkest), the less caffeine it contains. In other words, a shot of espresso can have as little as half the amount of caffeine in it as a cheap $0.79 cup from Hardees. It’s not the coffee (nor the caffeine) that brings customers running back– it’s the atmosphere. Starbucks could very well operate without even selling coffee. They could charge an entrance fee and offer nothing else but a room and mellow Bob Marley music softly playing in the background and people would still come. They recognize the niche they fill and exploit it fully. If only we could find our own ways of escape we would all be a lot richer, and probably a lot thinner. Published on April 1, 2005--- #### Devin Page For me coffee is an escape. It calms my nerves but puts my mind to work. In that way I can (as a stereotypical poor, over-stressed university student) can relax and do the work required of me at the same time.

# Starting Your Own Coffee Franchise [Coffee Business](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/coffee-business/)---by [Molly Mac](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/molly-mac/)![Starting Your Own Coffee Franchise](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/starting-your-own-coffee-franchise/yummy-espresso1.jpg) If you are considering investing in a franchise in the coffee industry, read this guide to become better informed on the process, as well as the pros and cons of coffee franchising. ### The Pros of a Coffee Franchise - **Brand Name Recognition:** Unlike a neighborhood coffee shop, coffee franchises offer you immediate visibility. It can also garner the trust of consumers, who will trust you have a quality product since it’s associated with a name they know. This can help you after the initial start-up of your business, as it will automatically give you a pool of customers to draw on. A perfect example of that is Starbucks, which has established its brand name worldwide and is recognized as a quality brand coffee shop. - **Training and Support:** Starting a new business is often a learn-as-you-go process. However, starting a franchise means the franchisor will provide you with the requisite training on how to operate the coffee machines, what equipment is needed to be purchased, where the best location for your coffee shop is, how to create tasty coffee beverages, and how to manage staff. Franchisors also often provide support, which is helpful if you have any questions during the start-up and early days of your business, as well as in the future when problems or hardships arise. - **Resale:** When you start a business, you want an exit strategy as well. Franchises generally work out the exit strategy beforehand, so you are aware of when and how you can sell your coffee business. The Franchise Agreement is the document that will stipulate the resale options, including how long your franchise license is valid. Some franchises even have clauses in the Franchise Agreement that say the franchisor will buy back the business if the franchisee wishes to sell. - **Marketing and Advertising Campaigns:** Not only is brand name recognition important to attracting customers, but marketing and advertising campaigns are also crucial to new businesses. Investing in a coffee franchise opportunity means you will have a national (or international) marketing plan already in place, and the franchisor usually provides you with marketing materials, including branded stationery products.![yummy espresso](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/yummy-espresso1.v4sv0gsH_1qejEL.webp) ### The Cons of a Coffee Franchise - **Must-Follow Business Plan:** Although singular businesses often become franchises because of a tried, tested, and proven business plan, the downside of a coffee franchise is that it has to follow a specific plan set out by the franchisor. That often means ensuring you are using the corporate logo in a precise manner, picking a location that the Head Office agrees with, and adhering to the decor picked out by the franchisor. If you are sure you want to invest in a coffee franchise, make sure you are in agreement with the franchisor’s business plan. The price you pay for a business that works from day one is some of your creative licenses. - **Capital Intensive Investment:** In general, opening a coffee business is a pricey investment. Initial set-up costs may include the cost of leasing a retail space (you may pay a premium for a space with a great location), purchasing necessary equipment (including espresso and coffee machines, refrigerators and freezers, sinks, chairs, tables, drink cups) and obtaining any governmental licensing for opening up a food-related business. The franchise fee may or may not include some of these components. Sometimes, franchises will give you discounts on equipment since they have bulk purchasing power and can help you negotiate a leasing agreement. However, they may also require you to pay royalties on your earnings or charge a fairly hefty franchise fee in exchange for all the benefits of the franchise – training, support, marketing, etc. ### Types of Coffee Franchises Although coffee shops are the dominant type of coffee franchise, there are a variety of different types of franchises available, including: - **Coffee Shop Franchises:** These franchises allow you to start a stand-alone shop or kiosk inside a busy shopping mall that sells specialty coffees and other products (e.g. smoothies, sandwiches, teas, cakes, etc). A coffee shop franchise often means you will need to lease a retail space of some sort, and it may cost more than other types of coffee franchises. A lot of planning goes into the start-up of these coffee shop businesses, as you will need to heavily consider location (you want to be in a visible place with lots of foot traffic) and the appearance of the coffee shop itself. Also, keep in mind that you may need to hire employees to become baristas for your business, meaning your overhead costs will also go up. - **Mobile Coffee Franchises:** A mobile coffee franchise is a van-based business that delivers coffee and other assorted goodies directly to people. Often, these mobile coffee vans travel to workplaces during lunchtime or high traffic events in your local area, or further away. That gives you the flexibility to work from home and set your own hours. It also means you won’t need to worry about leasing a space – only about the maintenance of your vehicle, which is often provided as part of the franchise fee. - **Coffee Distribution Franchises:** With a coffee distribution franchise, you will be providing actual coffee products as well as machinery to coffee shops in your assigned territory. That usually involves working from home and then traveling to coffee shops and restaurants to meet with potential clients. You won’t have to hire staff, as you’ll be the one drumming up business for yourself. ### Starting A Coffee Franchise If you have weighed the pros and cons of a coffee franchise, explored the types of coffee franchises available to you, and want to invest in a franchise, consider taking the following steps: - Make sure you don’t have too much competition in your area. There’s nothing wrong with a little friendly competition, but if the area you are looking to set up your coffee franchise in is completely saturated with coffee shops, you may want to look into an alternate location. - Research several coffee franchises that pique your interest. You can find these through franchise web portals like Franchise Direct, franchise organizations like the International Franchise Association, or franchise-related publications like Franchise Times Magazine. These are all resources that specialize in giving you invaluable advice about franchising and also provide comprehensive lists of available franchise opportunities. Also, if you already have a favorite coffee shop, check and see if it is a franchise. - Contact the franchises and schedule meetings with franchisors. One of the best things you can do is contact the franchisors directly and find out more about their operation by setting up a meeting at their Head Office. That way, you will get a feel for what kind of franchise package they offer and will actually get to meet the franchisor. This can be important as you grow your franchise and develop a relationship with the franchisor and the Head Office. You will find out how strictly you need to adhere to the franchise business plan and can figure out whether you fit in with the franchise’s culture. Make sure to get all of your questions answered and clarify with them what is included in the franchise fee, what additional ongoing royalties or fees will be assessed, and for current franchisees’ contact information. - Talk to current franchisees. This is one of the most important steps you take in setting up a franchise. Call or meet a current franchisee of the coffee business you want to get involved with and ask them questions about their experience. Important considerations include:  1. Did the franchisor deliver on all their initial promises?  2. How is your relationship with the Head Office?  3. Are you currently turning a profit?  4. What is the most difficult part of running this coffee franchise?From there, you can decide whether or not to pursue the coffee franchise opportunity any further. If you do, you will have to draw up a Franchise Agreement. This is a contract that tells exactly what the franchisor and franchisee’s obligations are, and it should be reviewed by yourself, along with any legal or accounting counsel you retain. ### Resources [Franchise Direct Coffee Section](https://www.franchisedirect.com/coffeefranchises/74) – Web portal for franchise and business opportunities related to coffee.

# Step By Step Bonavita Immersion Coffee Dripper Tutorial [Brewing Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/brewing-coffee/)---by [Michael Allen Smith](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/michael-allen-smith/)![Step By Step Bonavita Immersion Coffee Dripper Tutorial](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/step-step-bonavita-immersion-coffee-dripper-tutorial/coffee-dripper-tutorial.jpg) The French Press makes rich, delicious coffee. However, it has two drawbacks. The first is the sediment. To minimize the sediment, I practiced not pouring all the coffee in the mug and never drinking the last few sips. But occasionally, I’d forget, and my last sip of the coffee would be bitter and gritty—not a good way to finish your coffee. The second problem with the French Press is the cleanup. Knocking grounds into a compost bin followed by a few rinses to remove all the loose grounds before you can brew again gets old. The Bonavita Immersion Coffee Dripper solves both problems. The Bonavita Dripper makes a rich, clean cup of coffee with easy cleanup. It is very similar to the Clever Coffee Dripper. Both coffee brewers use immersion with a catch that opens on the bottom of the brewer. Both use a paper filter to capture the grounds, which makes getting rid of the used grounds simple and mess-free. The difference is that the Bonavita is made of porcelain, whereas the Clever is made of plastic. So the Bonavita is dishwasher safe, but the Clever is not. Also, the Clever opens by placing the brewer over a container, which sends the coffee through the bottom of the brewer. With the Bonavita, there is a manual valve. As for the quality of the brew, I believe the Bonavita Immersion Coffee Dripper to be the same as the Clever Coffee Dripper. ### #1 Add Filter Place a #4 coffee filter into the Bonavita.![insert coffee filter](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/insert-coffee-filter650.iSkCY9_w_1zgJgg.webp) ### #2 Rinse Filter Rinse the paper filter with warm water. This will remove paper residue from going into and interfering with the taste of the coffee.![rinse filter](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/rinse-filter650.DABFJix4_Z1Xs6J1.webp) ### #3 Add Coffee Add 30 grams (or 4 Tablespoons) of ground coffee. Coffee will be ground for drip coffee.![add coffee grounds](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/add-ground-coffee650.Jg6Ad0O2_2SbSK.webp) ### #4 Add Hot Water and Bloom Heat water to 200°F or boil water and let it sit for 30 seconds. Pour enough water to cover the ground coffee. Let it bloom. Wait for 30 seconds.![bloom coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/bloom650.8pivhyDv_Z25Prbf.webp) ### #5 Continue Adding Hot Water Fill the rest of the brewer with water. For those using a scale, the total weight of the ground coffee plus water will be between 500 and 510 grams (just under 18 ounces). This works out to a brew ratio of 17 parts water to 1 part coffee, which is a good starting point for brewed coffee. Adjust the ratio up or down based on your taste.![add water](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/add-water650.BNQzzU_4_Z217rdW.webp) ### #6 Stir Coffee, Cover, and Wait Stirring the coffee and placing the cover back on the brewer are optional steps. I typically only stir if the coffee is super fresh, and I never put the lid back on. Wait 2.5-3 minutes.![steep coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/steep-coffee650.4p4J4mRX_22DYfX.webp) ### #7 Release Coffee Release coffee over the carafe using the manual switch. Ensure the carafe you put the coffee into holds 18 ounces.![release coffee 1](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/release1-650.i8wd6QzU_Z1v5oqW.webp)![release coffee 2](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/release2-650.36LVUGPU_FoeLQ.webp)![release coffee 5](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/release5-650.Bc8gIwEv_1sXDup.webp) ### #8 Serve Remove Bonavita and serve coffee. ### Last Words There are many tutorials online for the Bonavita Immersion Coffee Dripper, and each one is slightly different. This speaks to how forgiving this brewing method is. I’ve made excellent coffee using different brew times and different grinds. I may or may not stir the coffee. You can also bypass the blooming step and just fill and stir. It all works. For over a decade, I was loyal to the French Press brewing method. These days, I prefer the Immersion Coffee Drippers. They are cleaner tasting, easier to clean, and just as rich.![finished brewing](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/finished650.CiWDmbK0_1A5flj.webp) ### Resources [Coffee Brewing Guide](https://ineedcoffee.com/coffee-brewing-guide/) – The INeedCoffee collection of coffee brewing tutorials. *Brewing photos by Joseph Robertson of Extracted Magazine, a digital coffee magazine published for iOS and Android. * Published on September 21, 2019--- #### Michael Allen Smith Michael Allen Smith is both a coffee fanatic and a web developer.

# Home Roasting Coffee with the Whirley-Pop Popcorn Popper [Roasting Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/roasting-coffee/)---by [Michael Allen Smith](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/michael-allen-smith/)![Home Roasting Coffee with the Whirley-Pop Popcorn Popper](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/stovetop-roasting-with-the-whirley-pop/home-roasting-coffee-whirley-pop-popcorn-popper.jpg) Other home roasting articles on INeedCoffee focus on roasting with electrical roasters, such as the [West Bend Poppery](https://ineedcoffee.com/roasting-coffee-in-a-popcorn-popper/) or the [iRoast 2](https://ineedcoffee.com/roasting-coffee-in-a-popcorn-popper/). You can easily start roasting at home with one of these roasters. But there are other, older methods of home roasting. This article explores using a stovetop popcorn popper, enabling you to roast coffee on your gas stove. It’s not nearly as easy as roasting with an electrical popcorn popper, but the advantages of this method are that you have 100% control over the roasting profile and can roast greater quantities at one time.![whirley pop popcorn roaster](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/whirley-pop-popcorn-roaster.CU3X-bti_Z1Nkprd.webp)*Whirley-Pop Stovetop Popcorn Popper *### Is Stovetop Roasting Wrong For You? Let’s start with a basic truth. Home-roasting coffee is easy. That is up till now. Whether you are using a popcorn popper, a Hearthware, Fresh Roast, or even an [oven](https://ineedcoffee.com/home-roasting-coffee-in-an-oven/), it doesn’t take much time before you are making excellent coffee. A big reason for the ease is that the roasting device handles your roasting temperature. Even the oven remembers where to roast once you’ve set the dial. And some roasters even handle the cooling. With stovetop roasting, it’s the roaster’s responsibility to keep the coffee in a temperature profile that will roast it not too fast or slow. That requires some practice and constant attention. During the roast, you, as the roaster, will need to monitor rising and falling temperatures and make adjustments, all while hand-cranking the Whirley-Pop. This is rodeo-style roasting. Too much heat and the beans will burn, too little and they’ll bake. **If you are a hands-off roaster, you can stop reading now. This isn’t for you.** The next requirement is excellent ventilation. Roasting coffee produces smoke, and the Whirley-Pop can roast 3 times as much as other roasters. This means 3 times the amount of smoke. The last caveat is the electric stove. I have a gas stove and could not imagine roasting on an electric stovetop. The reason is that during the roasting portion, the temps will fluctuate, dropping fast at first and then rising gradually. While this is happening, the roaster is increasing and decreasing the temperature. Electric stovetops do not respond as quickly as gas stoves. Is it possible to use an electric stove? I’m sure it is, and I’m sure someone is doing it, but it will add another level of difficulty for the beginner. ### Is Stovetop Roasting Right For You? There are a few things that stovetop roasting can provide that other roasting methods can’t. The first is quantity. Most home coffee roasting machines, including popcorn poppers, roast around 2.5 ozs (by weight). The Whirley-Pop can handle 8.5 ozs with no problem. The next thing stovetop roasting provides is complete control of the roast temperature profile. With complete control, you have more freedom to create different-tasting coffee roasts. The last difference is that it uses conduction heat.![kitchen scale weighing green coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/scale300.CW_MZ_nL_Z1Li1CO.webp)_The Whirley-Pop can roast 8.5 ozs of coffee at once._ To get started, you will need a stovetop roaster with a temperature gauge that goes to 500 F. Without a temperature reading, you are roasting blind and will have no idea if you’re burning or baking the beans. ### Equipment Checklist - Stovetop popcorn popper. The most popular brand is the Whirley-Pop (aka Felknor Theatre). - Gas stove with good ventilation. - Flashlight or good overhead lighting. - Pot holders or oven mitts are used to open the popper. This will get hot. - Metal colanders. - Green coffee (practice with a cheap, evenly sized bean that can handle darker roasts like Brazil or Colombia). - An assistant (optional, but helpful). ### Before You Roast - Open the windows, turn on the ventilation, warn your family, move your pets, and, if necessary, disable your smoke detector. You will see smoke! - Measure out ~ 8.5 ozs of green coffee. Experiment with volume. - Set the metal colanders either in the kitchen sink or just outside. ### Setting the Stove Temperature The most challenging part of stovetop roasting is controlling the temperature. Before adding the beans, set the roaster on the stove and turn on the flame. Your aim is to get the inside temperature up to 500 F, so ensure the lid is closed. The temperature will fall initially, and then as the roast progresses, it will climb again. The more you peek inside the roaster, the more heat will escape. Once the temperature has stabilized around 500 F, you can pour in the green coffee beans. ### Start Cranking Unlike roasters that push the beans around with fans, you are responsible for moving the beans. To get an even roast, start cranking, and don’t stop. If you get tired of cranking, have a friend nearby to switch off with. You don’t want to stop, or you’ll burn the coffee. Sometimes, I’ll reverse the crank to mix things up. If the crank sticks, give the popper a quick shake (lid closed).![crank coffee roaster](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/crank300.DsIqgxfY_Z1KP31s.webp)_Keep cranking the popper throughout the coffee roast._### Monitor the Temperature The first thing you’ll notice after pouring the beans into the pre-heated popper is that the temperature will start dropping. The 500 F will plummet to between 300 and 350 F. Every stove is different, so you’ll need to experiment with the amount of flame you’ll add. The goal is not to let the temperature drop below 300 F and try to get it close to 400 F. Remember that peeking at the roast releases heat from the popper, making it more difficult to achieve a steady temperature. It is a good idea to roast by listening. The good news is that unless the stove ventilation is loud, roasting on a gas stove is the quietest method of home roasting. You should easily be able to hear both the 1st and 2nd crack. The bad news is it takes both hands to crank the roaster and one hand to tweak the stove temperature. Having an assistant is helpful. ### Finishing the Roast A typical roast takes between 7 and 9 minutes. Towards the end, you’ll hear the start of the 2nd crack. You can peek inside if the temperature exceeds 400 F on the roaster. This will release some of the heat and check the color and evenness of the roast. Word of warning: don’t peek immediately after you flip the lid, or you could burn your eyes on the smoke pouring out. Also, use a pot handler or oven mitt when opening the roaster. If you have an assistant, have them aim a flashlight into the open roaster. The beam of light should cut through the smoke to visually indicate the roast color.![coffee roast in progress with Whirley Pop](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/stove.BCVQXsIh_MoleV.webp)_Whirley-Pop roast in progress._ Although lighter roasts are possible, it’s much easier to go dark. Roasting color with conduction heat seems to even out over time. An additional minute or two can turn a blotchy city roast into an even Vienna roast. Once you believe the roast is ready, turn off the burner and quickly carry the popper to your metal colanders. I like having two colanders. This allows me to pour the beans from one to another. This both cools the beans and helps remove the chaff. You can also use the spray method to cool the beans. For more information on cooling roasted coffee, read the 2nd and 3rd tips from the article [Popper Roasting Tips](https://ineedcoffee.com/popper-roasting-tips/)![cool the beans](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/cooling-coffee-beans.5d3plUYc_2iBUgj.webp)_Cool the coffee beans using two metal colanders._### Conclusion Besides being an excellent roasting method for those who wish to tweak the roasting temperature, this is also one of the cheaper volume roasters. For around $30, you can roast more than half a pound of coffee in under 10 minutes. My final word of advice is that this is not the best roasting method for beginners. Someone new to home coffee roasting would be better off starting with a roaster where they can watch the beans go from green to perfection. UPDATE: Michael T sent in this tip. _If you put a cast iron skillet between your pot/Whirley-Pop and electric burner, not only does it distribute the heat better, but it also soaks up and holds heat really well, so temperature changes are less of a problem._ Published on September 23, 2017--- #### Michael Allen Smith Michael Allen Smith is both a coffee fanatic and a web developer.

# French Press Tabletop Coffee and Tea Maker with Bru Stop Technology Review [Brewing Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/brewing-coffee/)---by [Michael Allen Smith](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/michael-allen-smith/)![French Press Tabletop Coffee and Tea Maker with Bru Stop Technology Review](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/table-top-press-pot-review/Tabletop-Bru-Stop.jpg) The original version of this article was published in July 2013. In November 2017, Planetary Design released an updated version of its Tabletop Coffee and Tea Maker. The new patent-pending Bru-Stop technology improves on a good product. Bru-Stop solves the two most common French Press problems, which are: 1. Keeping loose grounds out of the brewed coffee. 2. Preventing the coffee from over-extracting post-brew. The new filter added to the Tabletop does both.![Tabletop French Press](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/table-top-french-press650.D2oPj-3f_Zn4O8x.webp)_French Press Tabletop Coffee and Tea Maker_### Insulation When the first version of the Tabletop French Press was released, its insulating capabilities captured my attention the most. Until then, I had approached brewing French Press by only brewing enough coffee at a time for me or whoever else was around. Brew and serve immediately. Now we had a French Press that could retain better than glass models. If you are the type that brews your French press indoors and then immediately pours out the coffee, insulation probably won’t matter. However, insulation is more important if you are in a cold garage or at a campsite. According to the Planetary Design website, the Tabletop Press Pot is insulated with _“double-walled, vacuum-insulated, 18/8 restaurant-grade stainless steel.”_ I decided to test how the Planetary Design model compared with my glass French press. My kitchen was 68 degrees. I filled both press pots with water just off a boil and then recorded 10, 20, 30, 40, and 60 minutes of temperature readings. **The Planetary Design model destroyed the glass press pot on insulation.** See the chart below.![Press Pot Temperature Chart](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/press-pot-insulation.BMv3FCFC_1OJqAR.webp)_French Press Temperature Chart_### Some Plastic The Planetary Design Press Pot does have some plastic in the filter part that contacts the water. I contacted the company about this, and they pointed out that all their plastic is Bisphenol A (BPA) free. I attempted to use a standard press pot plunger for those determined to use zero plastic. It did not make a snug fit. You are better off using their plunger.![Planetary Design Table Top Press Pot](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/table-top-press-pot.CUuyTQYm_cGptM.webp)_The original Planetary Design Tabletop Press Pot_### Brewing Quality The Planetary Design Press Pot fits tighter than my glass press pot. It also uses an ultra-fine mesh screen filter, which results in a slightly cleaner cup of coffee than most French Press designs. I also used the pot several times to make oolong tea. Tea fans know that oolong tea is often rolled into tight balls, and it needs room to unwind and make contact with water. A typical tea filter is not ideal for oolong tea. A French press is a good solution.![Tea Trapped in Filter](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/loose-tea-trapped-inside-filter.BurV1rmu_29Kvhq.webp)_Not ideal. Oolong Tea Trapped inside Tea Filter_### It’s Pretty I thought I didn’t care about aesthetics, but the Planetary Tabletop looks nice. It comes in the following colors: - Black - Brushed Steel - Candy Apple - Green Tea - Mocha - Obsidian ### The Updated Bru-Stop Technology Below are some photos of the updated Bru-Stop filter. According to the Planetary Design website, they will soon be selling conversion kits if you own a previous model of the Tabletop French Press.![Table Top French Press Filter](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/table-top-french-press-filter-facing-up.tfCh7oUj_RRhP2.webp)![Table Top French Press Bru-Stop](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/table-top-filter-facing-down.BSy2T5Py_Kixyv.webp) ### Last Words I didn’t think I needed another French press until I could play with the Planetary Design Tabletop French Press. It is ideal for travel, as glass press pots tend to shatter easily. It holds temperature extremely well and makes a great cup of coffee. Now, it does a better job of keeping the grounds away from the brewed coffee, which makes the coffee taste even cleaner. ### Resources [Buying a French Press – Picking the Right One](https://ineedcoffee.com/buying-a-french-press-picking-the-right-one/) – INeedCoffee article to help you get started on a Press Pot purchase.

# Teach A Fish To Make Espresso [Cafe Culture](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/cafe-culture/)---by [Michael Allen Smith](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/michael-allen-smith/)![Teach A Fish To Make Espresso](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/teach-a-fish-to-make-espresso/starbucks-barista-espresso-machine1.jpg) Whether you like or dislike Starbucks, we can all agree that they are quite the entrepreneurs. If they can find another way to make a nickel, they will. Coffee, ice cream, beer (Red Hook’s Double Black Stout), sugar-filled bottled pseudo coffee, and even a magazine that has nothing to do with coffee (Joe). It’s a classic corporate maneuver. Expand the empire by widening the product line. But, I feel they may have stepped on their toe in the last year by pushing home espresso machines. Why would Starbucks sell me a machine that would give me the power to make my espresso drinks at home? I’m reminded of the old Chinese proverb. > Give a man a fish and he will eat for a day. Teach a man to fish and he will eat for a lifetime. ### Getting the Fish Moving from St. Petersburg, FL, to the DC Metro area was a coffee shock. The nearest quality espresso in St. Pete was either in Tampa or Clearwater. In the DC metro area, there are Starbucks stores everywhere. You can’t go more than 100 feet without running into another Starbucks. To say I went a little overboard with espresso-based drinks after the move is an understatement. I spent $30-$50 weekly on lattes and espresso at Starbucks. I have nothing against independent shops, but there aren’t very many, and the few I’ve been to are more concerned with projecting an attitude than producing a quality beverage. ### Learning To Fish Last winter, Starbucks started pushing their line of home espresso machines. At first, I was reluctant to consider the purchase, since I’d had a $75 piece of crap Salton machine a few years prior. The Salton made a gritty sludge resembling the robusta swill on Miami Beach. After that experience, I was convinced I’d leave making espresso to the cafes and make regular coffee at home. However, Starbucks persisted. They captured my attention, and I pulled a few sample shots from the Barista espresso machine. The Barista was a far better machine than I had expected. The sample shots had a full crema and tasted great. Impressed, I bought the espresso machine.![starbucks barista espresso machine](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/starbucks-barista-espresso-machine1.kAnqMcfF_1L46w3.webp)_Starbucks Barista Espresso Machine_ It only made sense for me to buy the Barista, but what I can’t figure out is why Starbucks sold it to me. Here I am one of their best customers, spending $3-$4 every few waking hours and they send me out the door with my own machine! Why would they want to empower the customer? You don’t see _Jack Daniels_ selling home distilling kits. Sure, Starbucks will pocket a few more dollars upfront, but won’t it lose a lot of cash in the future? Perhaps Starbucks was betting I wouldn’t use the machine and’d be back shelling out $50 a week in no time. I was betting I’d be homemaking my drinks, not ordering drinks at the cafe. ### Who Won? It’s almost one year later, and Starbucks has lost money on me. I’ve gone from buying two lattes a day to maybe one a month. I want to thank Starbucks and their short-term greed for enabling me to make my lattes at home; selling the Barista equipment has saved me far more than the machine’s price. ### The Updated Espresso Proverb > Give a man an espresso and he will have a buzz for an hour. Give a man an espresso machine and he will be buzzed for a lifetime. – Me ### Resources [Using the Barista Home Espresso Machine](https://ineedcoffee.com/using-the-barista-home-espresso-machine/) – Tutorial with tips on using the Starbucks Barista Espresso Machine Published on November 21, 1999--- #### Michael Allen Smith Michael Allen Smith is both a coffee fanatic and a web developer.

# Terry Francona: Coffee Achiever [Coffee People](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/coffee-people/)---by [Alex Scofield](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/alex-scofield/)![Terry Francona: Coffee Achiever](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/terry-francona-coffee-achiever/Terry-Francona-Coffee-Achiever.jpg) Terry Francona, apparently, is a Starbucks guy. Now in his sixth year managing the Boston Red Sox, Francona has managed the team that went 86 years without a World Series championship to two titles. Boston fans have mellowed a tiny bit since the title drought ended in 2004, but it’s still a potentially brutal place for a manager. In _Red Sox Rule: Terry Francona and Boston’s Rise To Dominance_, author Michael Holley describes Francona adhering to his Starbucks routine during a demoralizing 2006 regular-season series against the New York Yankees, Boston’s arch-rival: > He was going to need a similar pep talk on this Saturday morning, working on two hours’ sleep. He left the house, drove to Starbucks for the usual, egg salad sandwich and a large coffee — and headed to Fenway.![Red Sox Rule](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/red-sox-rule-book1.adVd9iZj_Yewfd.webp)_Red Sox Rule: Terry Francona and Boston’s Rise to Dominance by Michael Holley_ Holley isn’t the only reporter who’s picked up on Francona’s routine. Mike Fine of the Patriot Ledger and the Boston Herald’s Rob Bradford mentions it, as does the Boston Globe’s Amalie Benjamin: > But before he gets to that point, there are the 7 a.m. wakeups that often represent the only time he’ll see his two younger kids all day. The morning ritual at Starbucks, where he sleepwalks past the occasional autograph seekers to his tall coffee and egg salad sandwich. The matchups and reports that wait on his desk, where he left them the night before. The calls from players, detailing this injury or that problem. The trainers visits that don’t always bring good news. Holley describes it as a “large” coffee, Benjamin says it’s “tall.” At Starbucks, that could mean any of three different sizes. Can we assume that’s a venti he drinks every day? I like to think so, at least — and if Francona refuses to order it in _StarbuckSpeak_, all the more power to him.![Terry Francona, Jonathan Papelbon by Keith Allison](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/terry-redsox.DgyKQiEZ_Z1Id3sm.webp)*Photo Terry Francona, Jonathan Papelbon by Keith Allison* * In any event, I love this image of Francona stopping at a Starbucks each day and adhering to a cherished daily coffee routine. (Major League Baseball managers — they’re just like us!) Part of the appeal is that Francona is the near-opposite of a Starbucks-addict stereotype. He’s laid-back and self-effacing, and when Boston fans panic (which is often), Francona is an even-keel foil to all the regional anxiety. Coffee shouldn’t only be a means of keeping wired — drinking coffee that you really enjoy is a perfect and inspiring backdrop to the beginning of a workday. From late February until October (hopefully until _late_ October), that’s the way Francona is gearing up for game day. Like [MAS](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/michael-allen-smith/), my INeedCoffee colleague, Francona is big on drinking tea as well as coffee. He is a spokesman for Bigelow Tea and starts each game by drinking green tea with pomegranate. ### Sources Francona stands out among World Series-winning managers – by Mike Fine (article went offline in October 2021) [Terry Francona: Steady as he goes](https://www.bostonherald.com/2008/06/09/terry-francona-steady-as-he-goes/) – by Rob Bradford / Red Sox Beat [Demanding Routine for Francona](http://archive.boston.com/sports/baseball/redsox/articles/2008/03/23/demanding_routine_for_francona/) – by Amalie Benjamin_Title image of baseball field by_ [_Joel Dinda_](https://flic.kr/p/cnnSS)_Keith Allison’s photo was removed from Flickr in July 2019_ Published on June 20, 2009--- #### Alex Scofield Alex Scofield is a freelance writer who lives in Cape Cod, Mass.

# The Art of Coffee Tasting [Brewing Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/brewing-coffee/)---by [Stefanie Spencer](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/stefanie-spencer/)![The Art of Coffee Tasting](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/the-art-of-coffee-tasting/coffee-tasting1.jpg) What does your favorite coffee taste like? Would you consider it bold or delicate, acidic or smooth? Is your coffee heavily fruited, with distinct mango and tamarind scents? Spicy with a honey-dipped fruit character, fresh ginger, and clove? Spiced apricot tea and peach preserve finishing with a spicy cinnamon note? Wow, where do they come up with that stuff? It’s all in the “Coffee Cupping” process, and quite a lengthy and interesting process it is. First, let me say a little bit about our taste buds. Do you taste the same thing as I do if we are both enjoying a meal, or maybe a grapefruit? The scientists tell us no. Not only do the density and responsiveness of taste buds vary from person to person, but it depends on our genes as to the intensity that we can taste bitterness. On average one in four people have both recessive genes and therefore “respond to all types of bitterness less intensely” and this is “a general indicator of their overall taste capacity.” And as we all know, bitterness is usually an important factor in determining if a coffee is poor.![Coffee Cupping at Stumptown](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/coffee-tasting1.yewuEWQa_1Li571.webp)_Coffee Cupping at Stumptown_ Due to the differences in our tasting capacities, the opinions of coffee flavors can vary greatly, but how do the experts come up with flavor reviews? The process of cupping is a scientific method that tries to keep all of the variables the same so they can equally compare the coffees. First, start with lightly roasted coffee. As a coffee bean is roasted, it loses some of its sweetness, aroma, and more delicate flavors as it picks up more of the common roasting flavors, usually described as caramel, chocolate, smoky, or even charred. Next, take the lightly roasted coffee, ground to a drip or coarse grind, and put two tablespoons in a 6 oz. cup. While the filtered water is coming to a boil, evaluate the aroma or fragrance. Now the fun begins. According to the Specialty Coffee Association of America’s coffee taster’s flavor wheel, the first three categories are flowery, fruity, and herby. - Flowery can then further be narrowed down to florals, such as lavender, jasmine, or wintergreen; or fragrant, such as cinnamon, cardamom, caraway, sweet basil, or anise. - Fruity can be citrus or berry-like, such as lemon, tangerine, raspberry, or blackberry. - Herby might have flavors like onion, garlic, cabbage, or alfalfa. All this and we haven’t even added the water yet. So take the boiling water off of the stove (195-205 F) and fill the cup; let it sit for 1-2 minutes and then “break the crust,” putting your nose over the top of the cup use a spoon to push the floating grounds down and take a deep breath of the aroma. Now you might pick up more scents that are nutty, such as peanut, almond, corn, or barley; caramelly, like toffee, licorice, pralines, honey, or molasses; chocolate; or vanilla. Stir the cup and let the grounds settle to the bottom, removing the remaining floating ones with a spoon. Now it’s time to taste the coffee. Do we just take a sip? Of course not! Take a spoonful of the coffee and slurp it. Yup, with a strong breath, almost inhale the coffee, this should spray it evenly across the tongue and mist it into the nasal passages. Then, it is time to analyze the taste, body, acidity, and aftertaste. The taste is generally in the four categories of our taste buds: sweet, sour, salty, and bitter. Some descriptions are tart, tangy, nippy, mild, delicate, soft, rough, astringent, harsh, and pungent. - The body is an indication of the oil content, from thin to light to heavy, determined by its mouthfeel. - The acidity is the dry, bright taste that diminishes as the bean is roasted darker; too much acidity would be described as sour. - The aftertaste is, of course, the lingering remnant of the coffee’s characteristics. It is also important to note that as the coffee cools the flavors can change, so it is necessary to taste it a few more times as it cools to room temperature to understand the fullness of its flavor spectrum. Some coffees have been reviewed and given descriptions that tend to turn me away: swamp vegetation, algae, must and mildew, mud, wet cardboard, rotted wood, paper, and burlap. Hmmm. I think I’ll stick to the apricot tea, peach preserves finishing with a spicy cinnamon. Now, do you know what your coffee tastes like? I am still not sure. However, it is a fun experience to slurp and ponder and speculate. Happy tasting! ### Resources [Coffee Cupping: A Basic Introduction](https://ineedcoffee.com/coffee-cupping-a-basic-introduction/) – Article by Steve Leighton [Cupping: The Elements of Quality Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/cupping-the-elements-of-quality-coffee/) – by Christopher Schaefer [Coffee and Tea Tasting Notes For Beginners](https://ineedcoffee.com/coffee-and-tea-tasting-notes-for-beginners/) – An alternate approach to coffee tasting.

# Testing the Hearthware i-Roast 2 [Roasting Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/roasting-coffee/)---by [Robert Badgett](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/robert-badgett/)![Testing the Hearthware i-Roast 2](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/testing-the-hearthware-i-roast-2/iroast2-coffee-roaster.jpg)_This article was orginally posted as a 3 part series on _AboutCoffee.net_, which is no longer operating._ I have roasted an 80 gram batch of Costa Rican Tarrazu and a 140 gram batch of Colombian Supremo, and so far, it looks as if I will have to retire my Cafe Rosto. I have been roasting my own coffee for about five years but I am far from an expert roaster. I like to think I am an experienced amateur roaster. The only roaster I have ever used is the Cafe Rosto, and I am on my second one. Actually, I started out roasting with the Melitto Cafe Aroma, but please don’t spread it around. Using the Aroma is like riding a moped. It’s fun until your friends find out. Unlike the Cafe Rosto, the i-Roast 2 allows you to roast at different temperatures at separate stages of the roasting cycle and I need to see if that is worth the hassle.![iRoast 2](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/iroast2-coffee-roaster.Bl_DfTly_Z1rJsdX.webp)_IRoast2 40011 5-2/7-Ounce Coffee-Bean Roaster, Black_ My Rosto requires a lot of supervision to get a good, evenly roasted batch. In other words, I have to stand there and shake it every 30 seconds so the beans get agitated sufficiently. Otherwise, some burn and others aren’t roasted enough. I have wasted too much coffee because I was distracted (computer, kids, computer, wife, computer, telephone, etc.) during roasting and did not shake shake shake. The accepted wisdom is to never leave a roaster alone. It’s not safe. I know that, but, well, _mea culpa_ on getting distracted. My first two batches on the i-Roast 2 were beautiful! I did a preset cycle on the Tarrazu and it was perfect in 10 minutes. I programmed the Colombian to roast at 450 for 13 minutes, but I shut it down at 12 and it went into its 4-minute cooling cycle. Also a beautiful batch. Very nice roaster. ### Part 2 I probably have the most unsophisticated coffee mouth of all our readers. I have attended three cupping seminars over the years and I never could taste what I was supposed to be tasting. I have found that some coffees taste better than others, but I have trouble telling you why. My roasting expertise is at about the same level as my taste. I have roasted for many years but I really don’t know what I am doing when I roast. This i-Roast 2TM has taken the place of my Cafe RostoTM. I like the way it operates and I like the roasted coffee it produces. I recommend it to anyone who wants to get into home roasting or any home roaster whose present roasting tool isn’t working well. If you want a more detailed report on this roaster, do some research on Google Groups. The roaster comes with two preset roasting cycles, which vary the time and temperature throughout the cycle. The cooling cycle is 4 minutes and cannot be changed. You can test any variety of temps and times, up to 5 stages. The maximum temp is 485F and the maximum time is 15 minutes. You may save up to 10 profiles. I roasted a 142-gram batch of Sumatra Mandheling at the max temp of 485 and time of 15 minutes. I watched the temp all the way through and it never exceeded 410. You can push a button at any time and get the temp of the air coming out of the heating area. It is not the temp of the beans. I shut down the roast at 10 minutes because the beans had a nice oily sheen, just the way I like Sumatra. And, more importantly, the cup was great the next day. I roasted another batch of 142 grams of Colombian Supremo at 450 and 13 minutes. The temp hit a high of 376 and I shut it down at 12 minutes, just ahead of any oil showing on the bean. Great cup the next day. As you probably know, ambient temperature affects home roasters. I have always roasted in my attached garage and, while it is warmer there than outdoors in the winter, it still is cool compared to indoors. Another reason is the smoke and the smell. Roasting coffee produces smoke, especially the darker roasts. Also, it stinks. Many people think roasting coffee must smell good, since coffee smells so good when brewing. Not so. My washing machine is also in my garage and my wife is always fussing about my roasting making her clothes smell. (She doesn’t fuss the next morning while she sips her delicious coffee, though.) This i-Roast 2TM comes with a duct adapter that fits on top and allows a dryer duct to be attached so you can send the smoke out a window or hole in your roof. I thought, “wow, now I can roast in the kitchen without having to (1) deal with ambient temp, and (2) wade through my junked-up garage.” I picked a day when my wife was out of town, bought some flexible dryer ducts, and set everything up on my kitchen stove. I loaded the roaster with 145 grams of Sumatra and started the roast on the Preset 2 setting. That setting roasts in 3 stages, the first stage for 6 minutes at 455, the second for 4 minutes at 400, and the third for 1.5 minutes at 435. I turned the stove exhaust on and watched it roast. At about halfway through the smoke detector just outside the kitchen went off. I put it into another room and thought I was home free until the smoke started. Lots of smoke. My idea didn’t work. Maybe my exhaust isn’t powerful enough, but I will not be able to roast coffee in the kitchen. Oh well, back to the garage. I stopped the roast with 2 minutes to go since the beans looked right. The temp never exceeded 405. The roaster gives very good visibility so you can keep a close watch, especially toward the end, and shut it down by pushing the “Cool” button if needed. Since it continues to roast for a little while, hit the button ahead of when you want to stop the roast. You’ll learn with experience. You may set up the third stage to allow for changes in roasting time as it roasts. I have not yet played with different profiles for roasting. You can record up to 10 roasting profiles, each with up to 5 stages. I intend to do some more testing on profiles. Hopefully, my unsophisticated mouth will be able to tell the difference. I suspect that most users will pick a time and temp that produces a good batch and roast away with that one profile. This is a great roaster for anyone. It is programmable, it’s easy to use, and it’s priced reasonably at around $179. I recommend it. ### Negatives: - The instruction manual could be easier to understand. - LCD is hard to see since you need to bend down to eye level with the bottom of the roaster to see it. A 45-degree angle would be better. - The operation is too loud. It was difficult for my old ears to hear the cracks. ### Positives: - Good price. - Affected by ambient temperature, as are all air roasters. - Sufficient agitation ensures even roasts. - The batch size is approximately 145 grams or one cup of green beans. Comes with a 1/2 cup measuring cup. - Very little chaff escapes. - Easy to clean. Comes with a handy cleaning brush. - Efficient cooling cycle. Cools beans and allows safe handling of components. - Programmable roasting profiles. Allows hours and hours of tinkering and tweaking. ### Part 3 I am having fun with this new roaster. I said in my last post that I didn’t think many home roasters would bother with the programming, and “that most users will pick a time and temp that produces a good batch and roast away with that one profile.” Well, I get smarter as I get older, and the ability to change a roasting profile does make a better-roasted coffee. Different coffees need to be roasted differently to maximize their potential. And I’m not just referring to their degree of roast, such as “full city” or “Vienna.” The ability to change the temp at various time periods does affect the taste of the cup. Every coffee is different and the difference is due to the exact place it is grown. I have lots of roasting to do before I have determined the proper roasting profiles for all the coffee I drink. I intend to try many different profiles for each coffee to see what works best in the cup. It’s tough work but somebody’s gotta do it. I tried venting the roaster in my kitchen with the dryer tube placed at the range hood exhaust fan. It didn’t work, since the exhaust wasn’t strong enough to get rid of the smoke, so I tried it again the proper way, by putting the hose out a window. I used duct tape to secure the flexible dryer vent hose to the roaster’s collar connector. I saw that there was still a small gap between the collar and the roaster so I re-wrapped it and allowed about 1/8″ of the duct tape to extend past the bottom edge of the collar. That was enough to almost completely seal the connection. I roasted a batch of Sumatra, with a profile of 3 minutes at 350, 3 minutes at 400, and 5 minutes at 450. It reached a very nice Vienna Roast about 30 seconds before completion so I hit the “Cool” button and finished. It worked beautifully! There was plenty of smoke going out the hose but absolutely none in the house. When I roast to a Vienna in my garage you can barely see the walls because of the smoke. Now I can roast on a cold winter night and get consistent results. What a deal.

# The Brazen Brewer by Behmor [Brewing Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/brewing-coffee/)---by [Chris Arnold](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/chris-arnold/) Drip-style coffeemakers are abundant. Walk into any department store, and there will likely be several, many under $50. The problem with most of these coffee brewers is that they do not reach the optimum coffee brewing temperature of 195F-205F (90C-96C), as outlined by the Specialty Coffee Association of America (SCAA). And for the few brewers out there that might reach the correct temperature range, there is no telling where in that range it will fall, let alone the ability for the user to select the exact temperature desired. For years, espresso enthusiasts have had the ability to set the exact temperature, as seen in models like the La Spaziale Vivaldi and Izzo Alex Duetto. Espresso folks also know that the difference of just a degree or two can actually change the flavor of the coffee significantly. Some espresso machines also allow for a pre-infusion of water, which some say also enhances the extraction and thus the flavor.![Brazen Coffee Brewer](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/brazen-coffee-brewer.C_fu5Fln_ZT56jl.webp)![Brazen Pre-Soak](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/brazen-pre-soak.f4Pq5G_P_ZYxim5.webp) With the Brazen Brewer by Behmor (makers of the venerable Behmor 1600 Coffee Roaster), now the drip coffee enthusiast can be assured of a proper temperature range and the ability to dial it in to an exact temperature, as well as a pre-soak feature. The pre-soak feature is said to enhance flavor, and can also help with “bloom”, a phenomenon where very fresh coffee can expand too much, causing an overflow. Here is an overview of some of the Brazen’s features, some of which are specialized to appeal to the coffee geek: - Meets 2011 SCAA Standards - 40-ounce (1.2 Liter) Capacity Unified Stainless Steel Water Reservoir/Boiler - Variable Temperature Controls between 190F and 210F in 1F increments (88C to 99C in .5C increments) - On-board system Temperature Calibration with Altitude Correction - Full Saturation Water Dispersion Spray head - Pre-Soak function (15 seconds-4 minutes in 1-second increments) - Insulated Stainless Steel Carafe - Auto-Timer - BPA Free - Direct Brewing Feature: after removing the basket, you can brew directly into other brewers, such as the Chemex. - Manual Water Release Feature, which means you get a carafe of water with a precise temp for use in tea or other pour-over systems such as the Melitta Cone, Clever Coffee Dripper, or even French Press.![Brazen temperature](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/brazen-temperature.B6GMqgDk_ZrB9OI.webp) ### Main Features Instead of walking you through how to use the Brazen Brewer, I am going to touch on some of the more specialized features that set this machine apart from many other brewers. ### Variable Temp Control This is probably the best feature, and it works very well. I tried a couple of temperatures with freshly roasted Congo and Malawi coffees. Here are the results: - Malawi at 198F – Good caramel flavor, but mostly rounded and mellow. - Malawi at 202F – Really came alive! Oreo cookie, honey, tobacco prominent finish. - Congo at 198F – Earthy, Fruity, and a nice sweet finish. - Congo at 202F – Somewhat indistinct, finish a little bitter. I think it is clear that this is a feature that you need (even if you did not know it).![Brazen birdseye](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/brazen-birdseye.D05ftAi2_2rC205.webp) ### Altitude Correction I live pretty much at sea level, so I cannot really say if the calibration did much, but I can imagine at higher altitudes, this feature could make a big difference in dialing in your brew temp. ### Pre-Soak Function So I did have problems with bloom on some of my fresher coffee and allowing a pre-soak time of about 2 minutes helped a lot. I did a taste comparison with 0, 2, and 4-minute Pre-Soak times on some not very fresh Peruvian coffee, and I did not notice much of a difference in flavor. I suspect it might have made a difference with fresher coffee. But just controlling the bloom with pre-soak was awesome. ### Direct Brewing Feature This is really cool. You can take out the basket completely and fit your own pour-over brewer like the Chemex underneath for direct brewing. Just be sure to make sure the volume of water you put in the reservoir does not exceed your vessel.![Brazen filter](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/brazen-filter.sIJYt4B4_ZpgpSN.webp) ### Manual Water Release This is similar to the Direct Brewing Feature, but instead of brewing direct, you set your precise water temp and have it dump all that water into the carafe. Think of it as a very precise hot water kettle. Now you can use this in tea, or some other pour-over coffee systems that you may want a little more control over, such as the Clever Coffee Dripper, Melitta Cone, or even French Press. ### Summary I have owned and still own other SCAA-certified coffeemakers; the Technivorm Moccamaster and the Newco OCS-8. I ended up selling the Technivorm long ago, but still have the Newco, mainly because it is plumbed in, and is easy to just hit a switch. But now that I have the luxury of setting a precise temp and pre-soak time, I find myself using the Brazen 8 times out of 10. Maybe Joe Behm will consider a plumbed-in version in the future. Do yourself a favor and go buy one right now. Unless you need a plumbed-in coffeemaker, there is nothing out there that comes close to the Brazen Brewer. ### Pros - Reasonably Priced at $199 USD - Precise Temp Control works very well (and is addicting!) - Temp Calibration with Altitude Correction is a very nice touch - The pre-Soak feature can help with coffee bloom/overflow, as well as better extraction and flavor - It can be used with other pour-over systems like Chemex (direct brew) or Melitta/Clever Coffee Dripper (as a precise kettle) - Includes a gold filter but can also take standard paper cupcake-style filters - 2 Year (24-month) Warranty![Brazen pot](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/brazen-pot.CSAZy48w_22fg0F.webp) ### Cons - No plumb-in option - No glass-lined carafe option ### Resources_Disclosure: INeedCoffee was sent this product at no cost, which did not affect its review._ Published on December 19, 2013--- #### Chris Arnold Chris is the creator of Two Bit History.

If you do not have an espresso machine, you can brew double-strength coffee. - Fill a glass 1/3 of the way with crushed ice. - Fill a separate glass with 2 oz sweetened condensed milk. - Pour 2-3 oz of coffee (depending upon the strength you like) over the sweetened condensed milk (you’ll notice the coffee will sit on top as its own layer). - Stir rapidly with a spoon until well blended. - Pour over the ice in the other glass.![thai won on](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/thai-won-on1.zKFS7pzH_r9NN0.webp)_[Thai iced coffee](http://www.flickr.com/photos/moominmolly/2372132791/) by Molly_ This is a great dessert unto itself and is awesome after a spicy Asian meal.

# The 2 Best Cups of Coffee I’ve Ever Had [Coffee Business](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/coffee-business/)---by [Michael Allen Smith](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/michael-allen-smith/)![The 2 Best Cups of Coffee I’ve Ever Had](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/the-2-best-cups-of-coffee-ive-ever-had/clover-coffee-machine1.jpg) I’ve been thinking a lot about the correlation between quality and pricing regarding coffee. I got some negative feedback when I did a few posts about coffee pricing. One of the issues raised was that coffee quality is improving and it, therefore, demands a higher price. One comment I received suggested that not accepting the higher price was an endorsement of lower quality coffee. Correct me if I am wrong, but wine drinkers openly discuss price and quality – and don’t accept claims that more expensive wine is always better. Is it taboo to be honest about seeking certain flavor profiles at different price points? I don’t believe there is always a direct correlation between price and quality. To illustrate this point, I’d like to describe the two best cups of coffee I’ve ever had. On September 27, 2007, I had my best cup of coffee. It was the grand opening of Trabant’s Pioneer Square location, and for the event, they brewed the award-winning Panama Esmeralda in their Clover machine. This is what I wrote about the coffee the next day. > _What can I say? The legends are true. This was the best cup of coffee I have ever had. The coffee had so many unique characteristics, many unique to Central American beans as well as some qualities that I’ve only tasted in East African beans. It was amazing. Imagine a jam band of rock superstars making the best song on the best sound system. That’s a perfect cup of coffee._ The Esmeralda was $130/lb unroasted and $200/lb roasted. It was roasted by 49th Parallel in British Columbia, Canada. Other cafes charge between $9 and $15 for a single cup of this special coffee when brewed in a Clover.![Clover Coffee Machine](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/clover-coffee-machine1.BeXwB1t9_Z291Pva.webp)_Clover Coffee Machine_ The second-best cup of coffee I’ve ever had was a Kenyan Peaberry that I home-roasted in 2004. I don’t recall the exact lot. I had been home roasting different regions of Kenyan coffee for years, and I just kept improving my roast profile. Then, everything clicked. The cool California mornings and optimal resting periods made for a superb cup of coffee. I took it to work, and all my co-workers lined up to receive some of the coffee brewed in my press pot. We had been working together for two years at this point, and they all agreed that this coffee was their favorite.![Westbend Poppery](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/westbend-poppery.B_pNH2Xw_1uk48U.webp)_Westbend Poppery_ The Kenya Peaberry was ordered from Sweet Maria’s. With shipping, it cost me about $5 a pound. It was roasted using a Westbend Poppery, which I purchased on eBay for $40. My French press cost me about $20. Let us review the two coffees. Panama Esmeralda Kenya Peaberry Green Coffee Price per lb $130.00 $5.00 Roaster 49th Parallel Me Roasted Coffee Price per lb $200.00 $6.25 (20% weight loss) Roasting Cost per lb $70.00 My Time Additional Roasting Costs – $40 Popcorn Popper Brewing Method $11,000 Clover $20 French Press Cost per Brewed Cup $9 – $15 + tip**14 cents**_* I didn’t include the electricity used to run the home roaster, but I didn’t include the fuel charges to get to and from the coffee house_. Was the Panama Esmeralda brewed through a Clover better than my home-roasted Kenya? Absolutely. Was it 50 or 100 times better? No, it wasn’t. There isn’t always a direct correlation between price and quality. Although I love the award-winning expensive coffees, it is nice to know that you can still get a stellar cup of coffee on a budget. ### Resources Trabant Coffee – Seattle-based coffee shop with 2 locations.

# The Best Trends in Specialty Coffee (2018) [Coffee Business](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/coffee-business/)---by [Michael Allen Smith](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/michael-allen-smith/)![The Best Trends in Specialty Coffee (2018)](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/the-best-trends-in-specialty-coffee-2018/best-trends-coffee.jpg) Last year, I wrote a list of complaints about specialty coffee. You can read those at [Things I Would Like to See Improved in Specialty Coffee (2017)](https://ineedcoffee.com/improving-specialty-coffee/). Unfortunately, with the exception of #2 (Bus Trays) and #4 (Mugs without Handles), most of those issues are still a problem. However, there are lots of great things happening in specialty coffee. In this article, I want to celebrate those changes. Before I start the list, let me discuss my background. I am not in the industry. I am a coffee enthusiast who has visited hundreds of different coffee shops in the last decade. Most have been in the Pacific Northwest. In Seattle, I help organize a Meetup group that does nothing but explore the coffee scene. Here are some of the best trends I see in specialty coffee. ### #1 The Rise of the Multi-Roaster and/or Multi-Espresso Offering Cafe Around 10 years ago, a few cafes in Portland and Seattle began offering espresso options from multiple roasters. At the time, it was a revolutionary idea. Then, the idea of serving multiple espressos started to take off. Today, there are numerous cafes that offer more than one espresso, often from different roasters, and sometimes, those roasters rotate. As an espresso fan, I love this trend and hope it continues. I wish the cafes would better communicate that they have a 2nd espresso option ([see #1](https://ineedcoffee.com/improving-specialty-coffee/)).![3 espresso hoppers](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/3-espresso-hoppers.CfMz2tTB_Z1Y05lU.webp)_Coffee shop with three different (and rotating) espresso choices._  ### #2 Tipping Included Several cafes here in Seattle have removed the tip jars from the counter. They are adding the tip directly to the price of the drink in the form of a service charge. I’ve heard numerous reasons for replacing the tip with a service charge, most of which are outlined in the article  [WHY NO TIPPING?](https://web.archive.org/web/20191225043801/https://optimismbrewing.com/no-tipping) by Optimism Brewing. I’ve seen service charges between 10% and 20%, which is in line with normal tipping rates. I have heard mixed reviews from baristas, but as a customer, I like it because it is one less thing to think about at the register. And it is one less thing for every customer ahead of me to think about. Also, unlike a restaurant where the tip is given after service, coffee is one of the rare services where the tip is given before service, which can be awkward for the customer. ### #3 Apple Pay and Android Pay I love paying for coffee with Apple Pay. I hold my phone next to the point-of-sale system, hear a ding, and the drink is paid for. There is no cash, no change, and I don’t even need to hand over a credit card. It used to be that half of the total transaction time was for payment, and half went to making the drink. Now, it is probably 25% transaction and 75% for making the drink. I’d like to encourage my fellow customers to set up a credit card to use Apple or Android Pay. This will get these lines moving faster and let our baristas focus on making great drinks instead of making change. ### #4 Digital Reward Cards I still have six paper reward cards in my wallet (see photo below). Whenever I visit one of these coffee shops, I rush to have it out and ready at the time of purchase to collect my stamp. Other people don’t seem to rush. They don’t know where their card is, so they hold up the line digging through their purse or wallet looking for their card. Or even worse, they rifle through one of those community cardholders trying to find their card among several hundred. Digital Rewards solves all that. Pay with your phone (see #3) and earn a stamp. After 8 or 10 digital stamps, you receive a text with a code you can use to claim your free drink. SO MUCH BETTER!![coffee rewards cards](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/old-school-cards.Bqqu9kBp_1lzYNg.webp)_I look forward to all these cards being replaced with bytes on a cloud server._  ### #5 Whole Bean Coffee From Independent Coffee Roasters at the Grocery Store For as long as I can recall, the grocery store’s coffee shelves were filled with low-grade canned coffee or big corporate brands like Starbucks or Peets. That is slowly changing. I’m seeing more and more independent coffee roasters getting shelf space at higher-end grocery stores. The whole beans at the grocery store are less expensive than at the cafe or on the roaster’s website. I typically pay $3 to $6 less per 12-ounce bag at the grocery store than at the cafe. Also, roasters that sell smaller bags of 8, 9, or 10 ounces in their cafes will usually offer the full 12-ounce bag in the grocery store—and for less money. My one warning is to look for the roasted date on the bag. Fresh bags are often placed behind stale bags. If you can not find a roasted date, assume it is stale. Any bag that uses a “best before” date is not to be trusted, as it does not disclose the roasted date. ### #6 Honey Processed Coffee This topic probably deserves its article, so I’ll keep it brief. There are different ways to process coffee, with washed and natural being the most popular. Now we are starting to see something called honey style. Honey style doesn’t use honey; instead, it can be viewed as the middle ground between washed and natural. There are even different forms of honey-processed coffee. Read [Yellow, Red, & Black Honey Processed Coffees: What’s The Difference?](https://perfectdailygrind.com/2017/02/yellow-red-black-honey-processed-coffees-whats-the-difference/) from _Perfect Daily Grind_ for a good primer on this topic. They are discovering that different degrees of honey processing accent different attributes of a coffee. Depending upon the level of honey processing the beans receive, the same crop can be made to taste clean, floral, sweet, or syrupy. Costa Rica is taking the lead in honey processing. It will be interesting to see if this form of processing spreads to other countries. ### #7 Quieter Grinders If you hadn’t paid attention over the past few years, you may have missed this, but cafes have gradually replaced those old-school super loud grinders with newer precision grinders that have less waste and are probably half as loud. ### #8 Much Better Decaf Most decaf coffee drinkers don’t know this, but over the last decade or so, the good folks at Swiss Water have drastically improved the decaffeination process. I had a tour of their Vancouver facility a few years ago and was impressed. By measuring the moisture levels of beans before and after decaffeination, they can now get decaf to taste almost identical to the caffeinated version. Most roasters still don’t care, and many decaf consumers do not, so most decaf coffee is still unnecessarily roasted too dark. The good news is this is changing. As coffee drinkers become more aware of how delicious decaf coffee can be, they will begin to expect more, and we will see more widespread adoption across the industry. The best decaf coffee I have found tends to come from independent micro-roasters less than 10 years old that focus more on single-origin coffee than blends. ### #9 Instant Coffee Innovation All instant coffee is weak and terrible, right? Not so fast. Things have changed. In my article Next Generation Instant Coffee Reviews, I cover a few brands, such as Sudden Coffee, that have done an outstanding job of making instant coffee taste great.![sudden instant coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/sudden-instant-coffee.BrgVAYss_Z1Ey8nK.webp) ### Last Words Some exciting things are happening in specialty coffee. Innovations occur at every level of the coffee industry, from the farm to the roaster to the cafe, and ultimately to how customers pay for their drinks and whole beans. ### Resources [Things I Would Like to See Improved in Specialty Coffee (2017)](https://ineedcoffee.com/improving-specialty-coffee/) – My list of how the coffee industry could improve.

# The Best Irish Coffee in the World [Recipes](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/coffee-recipes/)---by [Jim Slaughter](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/jim-slaughter/)![The Best Irish Coffee in the World](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/the-best-irish-coffee-in-the-world/best-irish-coffee.jpg) I happen to make the best Irish Coffee in the world. I learned how to do this in a small mesón in Madrid, but I have since gotten even better at it than the bartender at that establishment, where I studied long and hard under his tutelage. ### The Recipe - One Irish Coffee glass (preferably with shamrocks and a gold rim), failing that, any smallish glass about 5 or 6 fl. oz. - One long shot of good espresso - Two fingers of decent Irish Whiskey (Jameson or Bushmills) - Two tablespoons of brown sugar - FRESH heavy cream, laced with a dollop of white sugar, beaten until it’s the consistency of custard, but not whipped to fluffiness. In Madrid, they refer to this heavy thick sweet cream as “nata”.![Irish Coffee Setup](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/Irish-Coffee-Collage1.BWR2px6D_1Rd8qW.webp)_Irish Coffee Setup_### Procedure 1. Have everything prepared and ready before you start assembling as time is of the essence. Get your nata prepared and keep it nice and cold. 2. Pour the whiskey and brown sugar into the Irish Whiskey glass together. 3. Then use the espresso steamer to heat the whiskey until it is good and hot and the brown sugar is dissolved for about eight to ten seconds. 4. CAREFULLY put a match or lighter to the glass and flame the whiskey for a few seconds. This adds a _je ne sais quoi_ to the flavor and cuts down the alcohol, bringing the caffeine and alcohol into perfect balance. 5. Pull your shot and dump it into the whiskey/brown sugar mixture. Between the espresso and the whiskey, your glass should be about 3/4 full (that’s why you don’t want to use a really big glass). 6. Carefully lay down a carpet of the “nata” over the warm coffee/whiskey mixture right to the top of the glass. Then, before the nata gets warmed up, enjoy the cool, rich cream juxtaposed against the hot, strong coffee/whiskey.![Light Irish Coffee on Fire](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/Irish-Coffee-Flame.DCR2L8IR_Z9hsDI.webp)_Light Irish Coffee on Fire_ Personally, I find these very addictive and therefore don’t drink them very often. New Year’s was the last time. But I can guarantee that you will never taste a better Irish Coffee than by using this method. I’ve had Irish Coffee at the Buena Vista in San Francisco which claims to be the world’s best, and it is a poor cousin to this one. The key is great espresso, the cool nata, and flaming the whiskey.![The Best Irish Coffee in the World](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/Irish-Coffee-Finished.C6uWftDX_ZypnyP.webp)_The Best Irish Coffee in the World_ These can also be made with Spanish brandy, but I prefer to stick with Irish coffee. ### Resources [11 Crazy Coffee Drinks You Won’t Find on a Starbucks Menu](https://ineedcoffee.com/11-crazy-coffee-drinks-you-wont-find-on-a-starbucks-menu/) – More coffee-based drink ideas.

# The Balancing Syphon Coffee Brewer [Brewing Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/brewing-coffee/)---by [Maria Tindemans](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/maria-tindemans/)![The Balancing Syphon Coffee Brewer](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/the-balancing-syphon-coffee-brewer/syphon-light-the-fire.jpg) It must have been the late 1850s. Franz Josef, Emperor of Austria, King of Hungary, was hosting a Royal banquet with his lovely young Empress Elisabeth, whom we all know from the movie “Sisi”. All the courts of Europe were invited to “Schoenbrunn”, the summer palace of the emperor and the hub of royal social life. It was a grand occasion, reflecting the wealth and power of the Hapsburgs. It was here that Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart gave his first concert at the age of 6. Afterward, according to Mozart’s father, he threw himself onto the Empress’ ample lap and gave her a kiss. But that’s another story.![Balancing Syphon](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/history-4.C5bEgemJ_ZKqr1q.webp)_Balancing Syphon_ In the 18th and 19th centuries, the pleasures of the table reached new gastronomical heights with the discovery of different and exotic foods and spices. Table settings became more elaborate. At each course, all the different dishes were placed on the table at the same time in exactly the prescribed locations. The Kings, Queens, Dukes, Duchess, Barons, and Baroness would help themselves to whatever was near at hand without moving the dishes, and if necessary pass their plates to their fellow aristocrats to get food that was out of their reach. This meant it was impractical for these noblemen to sample all the dishes so it was important to have an interesting selection of foods near each guest. Each course had the same number of dishes and as many dishes as there were in one course, so many baskets or plates the dessert had. This important feast might have had up to eight courses, dessert included. There was no lack of good cheer, and five hours at the dinner table was a reasonable latitude with a company this numerous. Servants numbered more than one to each guest. ### Dessert – The Crowning Glory of a Grand Dinner After this very elegant dinner, the table was prepared for dessert. Elaborate desserts were in vogue in the 19th century. As Horace Walpole wrote, “All the geniuses of the age were employed in designing new plans for deserts.” Gardens and pastoral scenes were evoked firstly in sugar to provide a backdrop for the fresh and sugared fruits, sweetmeats, jams, and creams. Such excess was meant to overwhelm the royal guests. Then, just as with the previous courses different desserts were placed at the table at the same time in exactly prescribed locations.![Balancing Syphon Coffee Brewer](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/history-2.CcpBcDdW_ddlOb.webp)_Balancing Syphon Coffee Brewer_ But, the enormous interest in coffee making in the early 1840s had its own consequences. Fashionable Europe moved to something new: silver and goldsmiths competed to supply the courts with exciting and elaborate contraptions to present the new delicacy, and Franz Jozef and Elisabeth had a surprise for their royal company. They had commissioned a Parisian goldsmith to supply them with a great number of balancing syphons. Silver and goldsmiths were famous for creating objects designed for solemn ceremonies or receptions. They were renowned for creating magnificent silverware to be used at sumptuous banquets. They avoided any monotony or repetitiveness in their creations. High and low reliefs were particularly widely used in decorating. These pieces of art impressed the esteemed guests with their exuberance, splendor, and magnificence. Renaissance, Baroque, and Rococo styles all got mixed up. Vienna, the capital of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, became one of the greatest jewelry centers of the world in the 19th century, and Viennese silverware in the so-called “second rococo” style was to be found all around Europe. The superior merits of the balancing syphon hardly needed stating. It was extremely safe, it was completely automatic and it had offered a great opportunity to doctors, mathematicians, pharmacists, coffee proprietors as well as glassmakers, silver and goldsmiths to try their improvements to the balancing syphon which showed that it was possible to make a perfectly simple design very complicated. Its appearance was only half the story. This tabletop coffee brewer was remarkable and a marvel to watch. It used the forces of nature, fire, steam, pressure, and gravity to brew the best coffee they had ever tasted. It held guests spellbound. “O-h’s” and “A-h’s” were heard as the gleaming, spigot canister pivoted up, as boiling water flowed through the pipet into the fine crystal glass, while the Bunsen burner closed automatically, which cooled off the canister, creating a vacuum, syphoning back the coffee from the glass and lowering the kettle again in the correct serving position. All automatic, all in a matter of minutes. This may explain why it became such a great success. The courts marveled. They had never seen anything quite like this! ### How Syphons Work Boiling water is pushed through the metal pipet. By the time the water reaches the grounds, it has cooled a few degrees. The result: coffee and water meet at the perfect temperature to extract the oils and flavors, but not so hot as to impart a “scorched” taste. The beauty of this process is that the coffee is brewed by extended contact with water at exactly the right brewing temperature, the temperature is maintained throughout the process, and then the coffee is immediately separated from the grounds.![Add Coffee To Syphon](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/syphon-step1.D479xalP_2ka474.webp)_Add Coffee To Syphon_![Light Fire For Coffee Syphon](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/syphon-light-the-fire.fvLBUFum_nzPjP.webp)_Light Fire For Coffee Syphon_ The system traps the delicate aroma and flavors in the closed canister to produce a coffee unlike any you’ve ever tasted. The bitter grounds stay in the glass carafe by way of a gold filter at the end of the overflow pipe.![Step 1 - Balancing Syphon](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/how-1.CbHE1Ksh_Z1kqJIa.webp)_Step 1 – Balancing Syphon_![Step 2 - Balancing Syphon](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/how-2.DQ89Q_OK_15Nwop.webp)_Step 2 – Balancing Syphon_![Step 3 - Balancing Syphon](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/how-3.Cr0IKbk5_ZrqXEg.webp)_Step 3 – Balancing Syphon_![Step 4 - Balancing Syphon](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/how-4.S1qYQyZz_Z11qudR.webp)_Step 4 – Balancing Syphon_ There are no paper filters to impart a slightly papery taste, or even worse, to take up the aromatic oils that give the different coffees their unique taste. The coffee from a syphon can best be described as “crystal clear”, with great purity of flavor and aroma and no bitterness added by the brewing process. Any faults in the coffee flavor will also show up, so syphon users tend to gravitate to the best beans they can find. No other brewer can give the same purity of flavor and lack of bitterness due to the exquisite temperature control, since the coffee brews about 2 degrees Celsius below boiling point, without ever actually boiling. ### Conclusion As of today, no coffee maker equals the balancing syphon in brewing the purest coffee. One of the most stylish, inspiring, and exclusive ways to make coffee is with a balancing syphon. The “alchemical” display of kettle, pipes, and counterweight, are guaranteed, just as it did for Frans Jozef and Elisabeth, to impress friends and relatives, while also making a darn good if not a perfect cup of coffee.![Pour coffee from balancing syphon](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/pour-coffee-from-syphon.EfnOFRoE_ZKCOST.webp)_Pouring the coffee from the balancing syphon._ Balancing syphon systems appeal most to those who value academic novelty and ceremony as much as the corporeal pleasures of taste and smell. The rules and customs associated with dining have changed over the years, but Anthelme Brilat Savarin’s “Maxims for dining”, published in the early 19th century still holds true: “When you invite a man to dinner, never forget, that during the short time he is under your roof, his happiness is in your hands.” With a balancing syphon at the table, your success is guaranteed.

I could cut down, but not today my mind is racing, miles away. There’s just one thing that’s on my mind. It keeps me going all the time. It’s not the symptom, it’s not the cause that makes me drive against the law. It’s just the caffeine and nothing more. It’s just the caffeine that I adore. I try to sleep, it’s late at night. My eyes are closed, but I’m uptight. My last “cup-a-joe” was after six, a temptation great to serve my fix.![Screaming Man - Coffee Speaks](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/badbob1.DAbme-Gx_1qXnd7.webp)_Screaming Man – Coffee Speaks_ Who’s to blame for my demise that keeps me troubled til sunrise? It’s not outrageous, nothing queer, it’s not a joint or glass of beer It’s just the caffeine and nothing more. It’s just the caffeine that I adore. I’m at Joe’s Diner at quarter til dawn. I see a new waitress clocking on. It’s just my luck, she’s serving me, and asks me gently, “Coffee or Tea”. Before I spoke, she jumped the gun, and thought she’d guess it, just for fun. “You’ll have the decaf, I can tell.” I said, “Your Satan, go to hell!” I just want caffeine and nothing more. It’s just the caffeine that I adore. I built an alter to coffee high. It’s from my backyard to the sky. Some say I’m crazy, some say I’m dumb. Where is this love of coffee from? It’s from the drug inside the bean. It’s from the holy drug caffeine! It’s not the flavor, or how it looks. It’s not from pictures found in books. It’s just the caffeine and nothing more. It’s just the caffeine that I adore. I’d like to know who devised this trend, to suck the caffeine from nature’s blend. I’m not the mayor, not the lawyer, or judge, but from my convictions, I shall not budge.![Screaming Man - Coffee is my drug of Choice!](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/drugofchoicemug2-474x650.DEZHsAJU_ZMyhIG.webp)_Screaming Man – Coffee is my drug of Choice!_ On the subject of coffee, that’s what I mean, and absurd removal of caffeine.

Some say their doctor made this rule. Some dude in L.A. must have made this up because he couldn’t handle a single cup. That’s where all the trends begin, just like that codependant binge. The world will suffer for this mistake, for sucking life from something great. It’s just the caffeine and nothing more. It’s just the caffeine that I adore. Coffee….. my drug of choice. It’s my only dominant voice. Inside my head and body too, it commands the actions that I do. Drive to work, or drive to play, just remember where your loyalties lay. I’m ruled by coffee, I’m not ashamed, there’s not one person I can blame. It’s just the caffeine and nothing more. It’s just the caffeine that I adore. I drink coffee when I wake. It goes with every breath I take. I pray to coffee every day. My devotion to it never strays. My love for people comes and goes. My love for life I’ll never know. There’s one thing certain, that’s for sure. My love of coffee will endure. It’s just the caffeine and nothing more. It’s just the caffeine that I adore. Caffeine is special, and radical too. It’s not confined to any rules, like “i before e except after c”. It’s got our language on it’s knees! It rhymes with “fiend” and “feeling mean”. It’s friends with drugs like nicotine. I don’t pretend to be refined, and drink great coffee all the time. It’s just the caffeine and nothing more. It’s just the caffeine that I adore. It’s a ritual of a religious kind. An act of worship I don’t mind! I’ll light a candle on my knees if it continues to fulfill my needs. It has its bad points, people say, “it’s addictive, it makes you crave.” But I respect that, and love it too, it gives my edge an attitude. It’s just the caffeine and nothing more. It’s just the caffeine that I adore. In the morning, when I rise, I’ve got that sleep crap in my eyes. I find it hard to walk or talk. I can’t complain, its no one’s fault. There is one thought that keeps me up, the thought of having my first cup. Lots of coffee, make it strong. I drink it strong the whole day long. It’s just the caffeine and nothing more. It’s just the caffeine that I adore. After lunch my body drags, my inspirational spirits sags. I need a lift, a little edge to keep my mind from total vedge. To start me up and feel brand new, I’ll have another cup or two. Its like I start another day, and sixty cents is all I pay. It’s just the caffeine and nothing more. It’s just the caffeine that I adore. It don’t take Einstein or Sherlock Holmes to figure out Im not alone. There are many here on Planet Earth who make their coffee house a church. They might deny it and say I’m wrong, but we all sing the same old song. If the price of coffee goes sky high, we’ll pay that price until we die. It’s just the caffeine and nothing more. It’s just the caffeine that I adore. I could go on forever, amen. I could go on til there is no end. I could always add an extra verse, my love of coffee is perverse. I’m not a poet, and I know it, but I’m an addict, and I show it. If I was silent, I’d be destroyed. I must scream out and make my noise. It’s just the caffeine and nothing more.

# The Clever Coffee Dripper [Brewing Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/brewing-coffee/)---by [Stefanie Spencer](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/stefanie-spencer/)![The Clever Coffee Dripper](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/the-clever-coffee-dripper/brewing-coffee-clever.jpg) Do you like the full-bodied bold taste of a French press but not the sediment at the bottom of the cup? Do you like the grit-free, clean taste of your filter brewed coffee, but wish it had more body or that you could make one cup at a time? The Clever Dripper is for you! The Clever Dripper is a new individual cup brewing device that uses the full immersion method of a French press and has a super clean finish due to a paper filter, or reusable cloth filter – it is the best of both worlds. It looks like a regular, single-cup filter cone, except it has a special stopper at the bottom, preventing the flow until the desired steeping time has been reached. It allows you to control everything in the brewing process, producing superior results.![clever-coffee-brewer](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/clever-coffee-brewer1.DItpkR2v_Z8qyTj.webp)_Clever Coffee Dripper_ To use the Clever Dripper, begin by placing a size 4 flat bottom cone filter inside and rinse with water that has cooled slightly from a boil. Place it over your coffee cup to drain and warm it up as well. Make sure you use a high-quality, fresh coffee for best results, and grind slightly finer than you would for regular drip. ### Step By Step Directions 1. Take the Clever Dripper off of the cup and set it on the counter. 2. Rinse the filter to reduce the paper taste in your coffee. 3. Place 2-3 heaping teaspoons of coffee into the filter and fill with just below boiling water to 1 inch below the top. 4. Let it steep for 3 minutes, meanwhile pour the hot water out of your cup, and then place the Clever Dripper on your coffee cup. 5. It should drain almost completely in 1 minute, which provides the optimum brewing time of 4 minutes total. Cleanup is incredibly easy as well. Simply pull out and throw away the paper filter, rinse in hot water, and set aside to dry – that’s it! If needed, hand wash in warm water. This is an incredibly simple device that can make an excellent cup of coffee. The Clever Dripper has become my favorite coffee maker for my morning coffee, and I hope you enjoy it, too. Remember to get the #4 size filters, too, $4.50 for a box of 100.![brewing-coffee-clever](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/brewing-coffee-clever.DBkxI028_ZLwJ7f.webp)_Brewing coffee with the Clever_![finished-brewing](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/finished-brewing.DytmrlEE_1jVhVt.webp)_Finished Brewing_**Hot Summer = Iced Coffee!** I have a wonderfully refreshing drink for you on a hot summer day, and it is super easy. Do you like unsweetened iced tea? If so, you will love this just plain, otherwise, you can add sugar and cream if you chose. If you are going to purchase coffee, especially for this, choose a “fruity” coffee; the natural sweetness and fruit tones will really shine through. Begin by using the Clever Dripper, or any method you prefer to brew coffee and make an extra-strong cup, or pot, by reducing the amount of water you normally use. After brewing, place the coffee in the freezer to quickly cool off or in the refrigerator if you are not in a hurry. After it has cooled off, add cold water until it reaches the desired strength, pour over ice, and enjoy! ### Resources [Clever Coffee Dripper Review](https://ineedcoffee.com/clever-coffee-dripper-review/) – by Chris Arnold Published on July 13, 2010--- #### Stefanie Spencer Stefanie writes for the Voice in the Desert newspaper, a local paper serving Cochise County, Arizona.

# The Coffee Avocado Shake Recipe [Recipes](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/coffee-recipes/)---by [Michael Allen Smith](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/michael-allen-smith/)![The Coffee Avocado Shake Recipe](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/the-coffee-avocado-shake/coffee-avocado-shake.jpg) Recently, I was at a potluck, and a woman from the Philippines brought a pitcher full of “avocado shakes”. The shake was made of blended avocados with added coffee. At first, I was skeptical that the combination of avocado and coffee would taste good together. But it did. It tasted delicious. It was sweet, creamy, and bold all at the same time. In addition to the Philippines, I learned the avocado shake is popular in Vietnam, where it is called _Sinh to Bo_. It tasted so good that I’ve been experimenting with several versions of this drink. Before I share my recipe, I want to say that most recipes that you will find online do not add coffee. Boy, are they missing out. The added coffee adds a nice boldness and a kick to the already sweet and creamy drink. Here is how I made the Coffee Avocado Shake. ### Ingredients - 1 medium-sized avocado (ripe) - 1/2 cup of milk (or coconut milk) - 1/3 cup of sweetened condensed milk - 1/2 cup of ice cubes - 2 shots of espresso or about 3 ounces of brewed coffee ### Directions 1. Slice the avocado open. Remove the seed and peel. 2. Place the avocado (minus the seeds and peel) into a jar. 3. Add the rest of the ingredients to the jar (ice cubes, coffee, sweetened condensed milk, other milk). 4. Blend everything. I use an immersion blender, but whatever you have will work fine. 5. Taste and Adjust. _Do you like it, or does it need to be improved?_ If the shake is too thick, add some more milk. If the shake is too sweet, add some more coffee. If the shake is not sweet enough, add more sweetened condensed milk. The Coffee Avocado Shake is more art than science. 6. Serve. I like using a wide straw, which is used for milkshakes or Bubble Tea.![avocados](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/avocados1.OE4zAAY0_ZN7Jc8.webp)_Slice open a ripe avocado.

I preferred brewed coffee over espresso and used coconut milk instead of cow’s milk. Suppose you do not have sweetened condensed milk; experiment with adding sugar or a scoop of vanilla ice cream to get the sweetness. Get one if you do not have an immersion blender (aka hand blender). It will make this recipe much easier, but they work great for soups and many other recipes. ### Resources [The Alkani Cold Brew Coffee Maker](https://ineedcoffee.com/alkani-cold-brew-coffee-maker-review-tutorial/)—Review and Tutorial—INeedCoffee tutorial on how to make cold brew coffee, which would work great for the avocado coffee shake recipe.

# The Coffee Lover’s Diet – 10 Ideas from the Book [Coffee and Health](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/coffee-health/)---by [Michael Allen Smith](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/michael-allen-smith/)![The Coffee Lover’s Diet – 10 Ideas from the Book](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/the-coffee-lovers-diet-10-ideas-from-the-book/The-Coffee-Lovers-Diet.jpg) I recently read Bob Arnot’s The Coffee Lover’s Diet. I really enjoyed the first part of the book, which broke down the current state of information regarding the health benefits of coffee. The second part covered coffee brewing and roasting, and the final part covered dieting and recipes. This overview will focus mostly on the first part.![coffee lovers diet book](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/coffee-lovers-diet-book.C6ynbdIR_Z16Ml7a.webp) Here are the 10 things I found most interesting in the Coffee Lover’s Diet. ### #1 Reduced risk of death Dr. Arnot mentions a 2012 National Institutes of Health study showing: > Coffee drinkers were less likely to die from heart disease, respiratory disease, stroke, injuries and accidents, diabetes, and infections. And this benefit was for both regular and decaffeinated coffee drinkers. He then cites a 2015 study by the New England Journal of Medicine that used 400,000 participants and found significant coffee consumption reduced the risk of death from all causes by 15% in women and 10% in men. But how does coffee provide these benefits? Read on. ### #2 Coffee Has Polyphenols Polyphenols are the anti-inflammatory compounds found in fruits and vegetables. Blueberries and cherries are especially high. They are also in coffee, including decaf coffee. Some coffees contain more polyphenols than others. The author refers to these coffees as high-phenol coffees. Coffees with high-phenol counts are grown at higher altitudes and can be found with good scores on Coffee Review. Higher altitude coffees also tend to have less caffeine. Caffeine protects the coffee plant from insects. The higher the coffee is grown, the fewer insects there are, because the air is thinner. So the plants produce a little less caffeine. ### #3 Coffee is the #1 source of antioxidants in the US Diet The Coffee Lover’s Diet has a chart by Joe Vinson, Ph.D., showing the most common foods Americans eat with antioxidants. Coffee is the leader by far, followed by tea. ### #4 Coffee Improves Physical Performance Dr. Arnot states three ways that coffee can help the athlete. Improving speed/power during exercise assists with fat burning and helps fight free radical oxidation. ### #5 Cholesterol’s Role in Coffee is Complicated On one hand, the chlorogenic acids in coffee can reduce the oxidation of LDL cholesterol. On the other hand, unfiltered coffee contains cholesterol in its fat molecules. But that might not be bad, since one of those fats is cafestol, which has powerful anti-inflammatory benefits. If cholesterol in coffee is a concern, use a filter or limit the amount of unfiltered coffee you consume. The book doesn’t say specifically, but I assume they mean a paper filter. ### #6 Green Coffee Extract for Reducing Blood Pressure The role of coffee in blood pressure continues to be debated. Dr. Arnot briefly mentions how green coffee extract can reduce blood pressure due to its very high levels of chlorogenic acid. If caffeine is a concern, green coffee extracts are also sold in decaf form. ### #7 Meet Melanoidin Melanoidin is an antioxidant in coffee that decreases the absorption of some fats. Dr. Arnot explains that fat peroxidation can lead to damaged cell membranes and increase the risk of coronary artery disease. It’s good to know that melanoidin can help. Time your coffee after meals for this benefit. ### #8 “Defy Diabetes” In a section titled “Defy Diabetes,” Dr. Arnot argues that the chlorogenic acids in high-phenol coffees help lower blood sugar and increase insulin sensitivity. ### #9 Neuroprotective You’ve probably read news stories about coffee’s benefits for conditions such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease. One theory explaining why this might work is that caffeine blocks the receptors of nerve cells that would have been targeted by clusters of beta-amyloid molecules. ### #10 Avoid the Dark Roasts Dr. Arnot states: > Very dark roasts destroy coffee’s most beneficial components and lead most people to pad their diets and waistlines with cream and sugar. Also, roasting coffee dark at high temperatures can destroy the polyphenols and even generate acrylamide, a carcinogenic chemical. A chart on page 108 in the hardcover edition shows the complete collapse of chlorogenic acid levels as the roasting temperature is increased. In tests, the author measured a 30% loss in chlorogenic acids in light roasts, 50% in medium roasts, and almost 90% in dark roasts. While the good chlorogenic acid levels are falling during the roast, the bad acrylamide levels are rising. ### What the Book Missed There is no question that the book was strongly biased towards the benefits of coffee. These benefits seem mostly about high levels of antioxidants that one could get just as easily from blueberries and other “super foods.” The problem that was glossed over was sleep. Coffee or caffeine in general can greatly reduce the quality of your sleep. And when sleep quality drops, lots of other health issues can develop. Check out the book _Why We Sleep: Unlocking the Power of Sleep and Dreams_ by Matthew Walker, Ph.D., for more information on sleep. The role of caffeine is covered. A true conversation on the health of a coffee drinker would balance the benefits (polyphenols) while addressing the role caffeine has on the different stages of sleep. ### Last Words The Coffee Lover’s Diet contains a lot more ideas than the ones I posted. If you want to explore those ideas further, check out the book and all its references. The second half of the book includes some coffee brewing tutorials and some high-antioxidant recipes.

# The Coffee Martini (3 Recipes) [Recipes](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/coffee-recipes/)---by [Chris Arnold](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/chris-arnold/)![The Coffee Martini (3 Recipes)](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/the-coffee-martini/coffee-martini-recipes.jpg) Martinis used to be a stiff drink. After all, it’s mostly hard liquor. Then James Bond came along and made the martini hip, and sometime in the ’80s or ’90s, they started adding “tini” to the end of everything, and the modern foo-foo martini was born. If done right, the “Coffeetini” or “Espresso Martini” can appeal to both guys and girls while still remaining respectable. Let’s get a few details out of the way before we look at the recipes. First things first. Vodka or Gin? Definitely Vodka. I love Gin, but I don’t think it works with coffee. What kind of Vodka? Use a true, premium Vodka like _619 Vodka_. I avoid infused vodkas for this particular drink since I want real coffee as the main star. But do what you feel is best. I like to keep my Vodka in the freezer for this kind of recipe. Don’t worry, it won’t freeze.![coffee martini 619 vodka](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/coffee-martini-619-vodka1.CB6uYiSq_Z2m6ctL.webp)_Coffee Martini with 619 Vodka_ What about the glasses? Well, Martini glasses of course. But for a colder drink, freeze them ahead of time, along with the Vodka. Shaken or stirred? I like stirred, mainly because it involves less work and I don’t have a shaker. Either will work. Brewed, espresso, or instant coffee? Actually, they all can work, but I find the espresso or instant works the best. In the case of espresso or brewed coffee, keep in mind you want to use it fresh, which means it will be hot, which also means it will dilute somewhat when mixed with the ice. This naturally means the espresso will hold up better since it is concentrated. You could chill the espresso or coffee first, but the freshness is somewhat diminished. Try it if you like, and compare the differences. In terms of bean origin, I have tried everything from Brazilian beans to Ethiopian beans to Sumatran beans. They all work well, but the Sumatran is my favorite. Just use what you have and compare.![Coffee Martini](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/coffee-martini.BAudgNui_Z25wgKq.webp)_Coffee Martini_ Instant coffee is a great choice if you are in a hurry or want to save some time. Don’t laugh, coffee geeks. Instant coffee can taste pretty good in cold drinks and dissolves even in cold water. A great choice if you don’t have an espresso machine or don’t have the time. It also allows you to easily increase the coffee flavor concentration on the fly. You might even be able to use cold-brewed coffee, but I haven’t tried it. I suspect it might be too mellow. One last note on liqueurs. A lot of coffee martini recipes include Kahlua, which is a coffee liqueur. I don’t care for it, generally speaking, in the first place, and for Coffee Martinis, I prefer to let the real coffee provide that flavor element. However, I have included Creme de cacao, which is a chocolate-flavored liqueur with hints of vanilla. You could potentially use real chocolate sauce or syrup, but I haven’t tried it. I am also afraid it might sweeten the drink too much.![Coffee Martini with Creme de cacao](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/coffee-cream-martini.DIrID_Cc_J1k8U.webp)_Coffee Martini with Creme de Cacao_ Please experiment. ### Recipes**Classic Coffee Martini**- Double Shot of Espresso or 1-2 Tbsp. of Instant Coffee mixed with 2 ounces of water - 2 Ounces of Premium Vodka Pour the espresso or coffee mixture over the ice in a pitcher or shaker filled with ice, followed by the Vodka. Stir or shake the coffee and vodka for at least 1 minute. Strain and pour into a Martini glass. OPTIONAL: Garnish with lemon or orange peel. If you want to sweeten the drink a bit, you can also add some sugar syrup to the liquid mixture.**Vanilla Cream Martini**- Double Shot of Espresso or 1-2 Tbsp. of Instant Coffee mixed with 2 ounces of water - 2 Ounces of Premium Vodka - 1/2 Cup Heavy Cream - 1/2 Tsp Vanilla extract - 2 Tsp Raw Brown Sugar In a cold metal bowl, use an electric mixer on low to turn the heavy cream into whipped cream. Mix in the sugar and vanilla mid-way through and continue until the mixture has stiff peaks. In a pitcher or shaker filled with ice, pour the espresso or coffee mixture over the ice, followed by the Vodka. Stir or shake the coffee and vodka for at least 1 minute. Strain and pour into a Martini glass. Dollop the whipped cream mixture on top. OPTIONAL: Rub the rim of the glass with Vodka and coat it with sugar. You can also drop 2 or 3 coffee beans on top of the cream. If you want to sweeten the drink a bit, you can add some sugar syrup to the liquid mixture.**Creamy Dark Chocolate Martini**- Double Shot of Espresso or 1-2 Tbsp. of Instant Coffee mixed with 2 ounces of water - 1 1/2 Ounces of Premium Vodka - 1 Ounce Creme de Cacao Dark - 1/4 cup Half & Half In a pitcher or shaker filled with ice, pour the espresso or coffee mixture over the ice, followed by the Vodka, Creme de Cacao, and Half & Half. Stir or shake the coffee and vodka for at least 1 minute. Strain and pour into a Martini glass. OPTIONAL: Include some large pieces of dark chocolate on the rim. This can be tricky but is made easier by using a hot knife to put a groove in the chocolate, to allow it to sit on the rim. You can also add a whipping cream dollop (from another recipe), and float some small chocolate shavings on top. You can also add some sugar syrup to the liquid mixture if you want to sweeten the drink a bit.![619 Vodka](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/619vodka.DunaBIEQ_JDmDE.webp)_619 Vodka by 619 Spirits_### Conclusion Don’t be afraid to use the above recipes to experiment or even combine some elements of them. There are countless ways to make an _Espressotini_ or _Coffeetini_, so have fun. Next time you wake up and are trying to decide between hard liquor and a cup of coffee, maybe these recipes can end the argument between the voices in your head.

# The Coffee Mill [Coffee Business](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/coffee-business/)---by [Paul Risman](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/paul-risman/)![The Coffee Mill](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/the-coffee-mill/container-4-250.jpg) The importance of quality control in the milling of coffee cannot be understated. This is the transitional step in the life of a beautiful coffee bean, once a flower, to transform into what we know as a high-quality coffee. Inadequate milling, or allowing the beans to over dry, will destroy the beans’ opportunity to become a superior drink. Extreme care is necessary to achieve a superior bean, so that the utmost flavor is not lost in the process. As milling is so important to producing a superior cup of coffee, so too is the type of mill process. There are two methods: the ‘wet mill’ and the ‘dry mill’. Both techniques use vastly different processes. Wet milling, the more costly of the two techniques, has been proven to produce a better quality coffee. ### The Dry Mill Before the invention of the wet mill process, dry milling was the only method available. In this process, the whole bean is dried immediately after harvesting the crop. It is dried until it has acquired the desired humidity level. The coffee beans are spread out in the sun, or in specially designed mechanical drying machines. This simple process is used in those regions where the climate and topographic conditions allow it. In other words, they are located on flat terrain where the drying machines can be installed properly. The process must take place at the beginning of a drought and during the maturing and harvesting stages of the coffee crop. Typically, dry milling is used in places where the conditions (altitude, grain type, etc) do not allow for a high-quality crop. Without optimum conditions, mills typically do not invest in infrastructure. For instance, there is no selective harvesting of the beans, and a tendency to mix coffee grains (unripe beans with green coffee beans). Also, inappropriate handling of beans when drying, or heaping the coffee beans, causes fermentation and eventually mold. This results in bitter coffee. By using the dry mill method, you can conclude it will not produce high-quality coffee beans. ### The Wet Mill This type of mill has seven different processes: recollection, pulping, fermenting, washing, drying, thrashing, classifying, and selecting. ### Harvesting and Selection The quality of the coffee bean and the abundance of future crops rely greatly on effective management. Depending on the type of crop, the coffee enters its productive phase two to three years after it’s transplanted into its final home. The endurance of the crop in time is directly related to the established agricultural practices and climatic factors. Despite the macro climatic conditions, the producer improves the growing conditions by using organic or inorganic fertilizers to promote growth. Shade is necessary to regulate temperature and frequent pruning will benefit harvesting. But, in order to get an excellent cup of coffee, picking the coffee beans must be done properly. The best way to pick beans is to be selective; picking only the ripe beans one by one. A ripe bean is one that has optimal coloration and that detaches easily from the plant by using only slight pressure. Coffee beans do not ripen uniformly making it necessary to pick the same crop several times. Once the coffee bean has been picked and stored it should not be exposed to direct sunlight. The heat, over piling and poor ventilation contributes to the fermenting of the crop and therefore deteriorating the coffee’s quality. ### Pulping The purpose of this part of the process is to separate the coffee bean exterior covering, called epicarp and mesocarp, which are commonly referred to as the pulp and the cherry.![pulping](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/chancador2501.BIxS_SIw_23dPPC.webp) This separation has to be done properly because it can influence the coffee quality and yielding. The pulping of the ripe coffee beans must be done the same day, within 10 hours of the picking of the beans, to avoid fermentation. ### Fermentation When the coffee bean has been separated, it remains covered in a mucilaginous layer that ferments by itself with the help of fungi, bacteria, and yeast. Once the liquefaction process is finished the beans must be washed in order to eliminate the alcohol, acetic lactic, propionics, and brutinics acids that remain on the beans. It is very important that appropriate timing be used in order to stop the fermenting process, by washing the beans immediately. The humidity level is key for this phase. The fermentation must be interrupted at its optimum point. Any coffee beans that have not been fermented enough must be removed, as they may later give a poor appearance and may cause fungus growth. If the beans are over fermented they lose weight, which will influence the quality of the coffee. ### Washing The washing process eliminates the residual substances from the mucilaginous that remain on the bean. When the coffee is washed at the precise moment during the fermentation process, it will present a clean, rough, and whitish appearance without honey-like residue. Clear clean water ensures optimal results. If the washing is not effective, a secondary fermentation may start, and as a consequence, the cherry will have a stained appearance, and it will smell bad. To avoid contaminating rivers and streams with the residual water after washing the coffee beans, the water must be piped through purification cavities, infiltration ditches, or other technological processes for its purification. ### Drying Immediately after the washing, the drying phase takes place. Drying the beans has to be done with extreme caution because the bean is highly hygroscopic and sensitive, easily absorbing the smells that it is exposed to. There are two different types of drying: the natural way with the sun and artificial drying.![drying](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/secadoras-con-papi250.gR_40V0v_Z1JN5PS.webp) The coffee bean that has had an optimal drying process has a humidity level of 10 to 12%. Its principal characteristic is its blue/green color. ### Storing Storage of the coffee directly influences how long a coffee can maintain its quality. In order to achieve longevity, coffee must be stored in dry parchment, paying close attention to the humidity (10-12%). Therefore, avoiding any whitening, fermenting, or bad smell or taste. The storing must take place in a dry, clean, and well-ventilated storage.![storage](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/container-4-250.3YX6X5_H_Zi0Uqn.webp)![silos](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/silos250.DzXCAQQi_Z18vA3c.webp) ### Thrashing Coffee thrashing is an industrial process whereby the dried beans turn into golden coffee. This process consists of two phases: first, the outer shell (or cisco) is broken away and the almond bean is revealed. The second phase is the careful selection of the beans according to their physical characteristics (color, size, shape). A special thrashing machine is used, which enables the separation of the two parts. ### Classification and Selection Manual and mechanical methods are used for classification and selection. In the mechanical selection process, the beans are classified according to their size. A densimeter machine is used, which works based on the principle of density or specific weight of each bean. The electronic selection method utilizes electronic machines. These separate the beans that are pigmented, black, or have any other color but the blue-green they should. At the same time, it selects or separates the rest according to their color characteristics.![the mill](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/catadoras250.Dksh3CfP_z2GxQ.webp) Once the coffee has been selected, it is packaged in 69 kgs bags, which are pre-labeled according to the rules and specifications for each destination.

# The Coffee Cups – A Short Story [Cafe Culture](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/cafe-culture/)---by [Ellen Ulken](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/ellen-ulken/)![The Coffee Cups – A Short Story](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/the-coffee-cups-a-short-story/coffee-cups-kirkland1.jpg) Jerry and I have known each other for 40 years. We share living quarters and enjoy our time together, but we both like freedom—each to pursue our individual quests. Our separate grown children don’t need us much, since they’re all wonderfully independent. Though retired, we tend to spend work hours apart and link up for meals here and there, or in the coffee shops around town. Jerry and I both love coffee. We each have a favorite cup: his from his other life with his wife of 30 years, and mine from my former life with my husband of 22 years. Jerry’s cup is small, made of white porcelain, a sort of refined mug, pentagonal in shape. My mug is shorter and wider, with wavy, brown, rust, and white vertical stripes—stoneware really. These cups look like us. Jerry is more proper and traditional than I am. I am more rustic and casual than he. Jerry’s cup has chips in the rim and the base. Mine is run through with multiple mini-cracks that look like a maze of tiny roads on a city map, but no chips. Recently, a friend told me I should _disappear_ Jerry’s cup, to save him from lead poisoning where the glaze is worn off. But, he’s so attached to it I’m not sure what the consequences would be —even the unspoken ones. Better the poison.![Coffee Cups](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/coffee-cups-kirkland1.C3SwYCk9_Z2KpLd.webp)_Coffee Cups_ Our cabinets are filled with matching cups, but if our favorite—old-time—cups are available, that is if they are clean and on the shelf, we go for them. Now, why do we hang on to these last vestiges of our former lives? I can only reason that the cups represent the years and not the former spouses. Jerry’s wife had fits of temper; tossed his clothes out the window, locked him out of the house, and changed the locks on the doors, for example. My husband usually spent our wedding anniversaries in another country, celebrating his mother’s birthday, for another example. In fact, when Jerry and I found each other again, we admired a teddy bear in a store covered in calico patches. We bought the wounded bear. “That’s us,” we said. And ever since, the teddy bear is a symbol of our affection for each other. I got the coffee habit during nurses training in the late 50s and early 60s, the years when I first knew Jerry, who interned at Grady Hospital in Atlanta, and trained for doctoring while I trained for nursing at another hospital. My roommates and I drank coffee from short, wide water glasses to stay awake to study, until the brew, once nasty to the tongue, began to taste good. A hundred student nurses lived on the sixth floor of a new Piedmont Hospital, in what would become after the nurses’ dorm was built-patient rooms. We lived with three girls in a room and bath and shared a kitchen, a lounge, and a solarium with the others. The kitchen shelves held a few bread plates and a large ration of water glasses. A toaster stood on the counter. Each evening at 8:00 P.M., the hospital kitchen sent up bread, butter, coffee, and milk. None of us possessed a coffee mug—most of us were poor, otherwise, we would have attended a proper college somewhere—and the hospital didn’t provide them, so after the coffee was poured, you had to wait ’til it cooled down before you could hold onto the glass tumbler. I still have an image of that aromatic coffee, generously laced with full milk, wafting its curls of steam, waiting to be drunk. Those water glasses without handles are the other _coffee cups_ I remember affectionately. Inexplicably, about a week ago and during the time I’ve been writing this piece, as I unloaded the dishwasher my thirty-three-year-old favorite mug fell from my fingers to the stone floor in the kitchen and smashed into pieces. Is this a sign? Will I shop for another one? That pattern of stoneware is still available. I saw it not too many years ago in Dillard’s. But no, maybe Jerry’s cup will break soon, and I’ll go out and buy a pair of glass cups—with handles—put them on the kitchen shelf, and see what happens. Published on January 1, 2005--- #### Ellen Ulken In Louisiana the coffee is often ground with chicory. Jerry and I usually drink a dark roasted chicory brew at home, made by CDM (Cafe du Monde) or Community Coffee, long time New Orleans coffee bean roasters. However, we love a good Cappuccino (dry and low fat) from Starbucks, or from CC’s, Community Coffee’s own coffee shop chain. P.J.’s is another local java house franchise. Fortunately there’s a coffee possibility on every corner these days. It’s wonderful. I have come to writing late, as a retiree, and do mostly memoir, but have also penned a small book, meant for young adults, but suitable for all who are interested in the man, on Stephen Collins Foster, composer of “Oh! Susanna” and “Jeanie with the Light Brown Hair.” It is now in production at Xlibris and will soon be available to readers.

# The Coffee Breakfast Cereal [Coffee Business](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/coffee-business/)---by [Michael Allen Smith](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/michael-allen-smith/) In 2003, the coffee world received word that New Zealand had developed the first coffee-flavored breakfast cereal. From the original Hubbards press release courtesy of _Badgett’s Coffee E-Journal_: > An innovative new cereal to combine your morning coffee with breakfast. Light aromatic coffee flavoured wheat flakes combined with crisp rice flakes and yoghurt-coated cornflakes. I went to the Hubbards website to see if this cereal was still available. It isn’t. On the FAQ, the _Cafe Au Lait Cereal_ has been added to the deleted list. I’m guessing _deleted_ is Kiwi for _discontinued_. Then I did some searching and located the original PDF with a photo of a box of the coffee-flavored cereal.![coffee cereal](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/coffee-cereal-500x3821.DDaiIKEg_1t48Jv.webp) Will we get another chance at a coffee breakfast cereal? Perhaps. In June 2008, Andrew Hetzel of CoffeeStrategies.com took a photo of a possible new cereal called _Coffee Flakes_. ### Connecting With Coffee Flakes I began an email correspondence with Reiga Foods about the coffee breakfast cereal. They were cool enough to send me two boxes of Coffee Flakes to try out. Since I normally eat eggs or oatmeal for breakfast, I wasn’t sure my opinion of the product would be as valuable as that of true breakfast cereal eaters. Plus, I wanted to get the thoughts of not just any cereal eaters but cereal eaters who are true coffee fans. After all, do we care what non-coffee drinkers think? Of course not.![Coffee Flakes Cereal](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/coffee-flakes-397x500.DtA6JeBH_Z2eM4OT.webp)_Coffee Flakes Cereal_ I brought a box of Coffee Flakes to the _Coffee Club of Seattle_. I was able to share the cereal with eleven of my fellow members. I had everyone cup their hands, and I went around the room pouring cereal. **They all loved the cereal.** The taste of coffee was subtle and not overpowering. When you first bite into Coffee Flakes, the corn taste is prominent, but as you chew, the coffee flavor comes through at the end. In addition to eating it dry like a snack, I also tried it in whole-fat plain yogurt. It was really good. Although it has been years since I’ve had cereal, I was impressed by the high quality of the product. Coffee Flakes isn’t your standard breakfast cereal. It appears to be a premium product. Here is an overview of Coffee Flakes characteristics: - Gluten-Free - USDA Organic - Enriched with 140 mg of Omega 3 per serving - Made in Italy - Corn Flakes coated with “real Italian Coffee” Super strict vegetarians may want to avoid Coffee Flakes since the Omega 3 enrichment comes from fish oil. The part of the nutritional profile that was most interesting to me was that they made it gluten-free. Gluten is a water-soluble protein that gives dough its elasticity. It is found in grains such as wheat, rye, and barley. Author Mark Sisson details the problems with gluten in his book The Primal Blueprint. He states that about one-third of people are gluten-intolerant or gluten-sensitive. To this group and possibly others, gluten can create an inflammatory reaction that can manifest in numerous ways, including joint pain, acid reflux, autoimmune disorders, dermatitis, and Celiac disease. How much caffeine is a bowl of cereal? Very little. I asked Reiga Foods, and they estimated that if you ate an entire box, it would be as much as half a shot of espresso. In other words, you’ll still need coffee to get your caffeine fix. UPDATE (2014): It appears this product no longer exists. ### Sources Riega Foods – Website for Coffee Flakes.

# The Coffee House – A History [Coffee History](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/coffee-history/)---by [Stefanie Spencer](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/stefanie-spencer/)![The Coffee House – A History](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/the-coffee-house-a-history/womens-petition-against-coffee1.jpg) Coffee was cultivated in Africa as early as the 9th century, but it did not reach Europe until the 17th century. However, when it did, it was met with many varying opinions. It still caught on like a wildfire, even with the people that detested its existence. The 18th century London coffee house was the center of controversy in many ways, even to the point of the king trying to ban coffee and close the establishments. Being the place for political discussion, some of the policies of our newly formed country might have originated in one of these places. Coffee did not come via a direct route from Africa but found its way to Britain through Mediterranean trade routes with the Muslim world. Queen Elizabeth, I irritated her European neighbors by opening up diplomatic relations with her new-found Moroccan and Ottoman friends, establishing good trading relations and sea-faring agreements. This trade allowed goods such as tea from Asia, coffee, and chocolate to filter into England. The Middle East had coffee houses over a hundred years before they ever appeared in England. In 1652 Pasqua Rosee, the servant of a merchant trader and an immigrant from Ottoman Smyrna, opened the first coffee house in London, which later became known as “The Turks Head.” “Rosee’s coffee-house, in St Michael’s Alley, Cornhill, was located in the centre of the financial district of the City of London, and his first clientele were merchants of the Levant Company, the trading house that organised and regulated trade with the Ottoman Empire.” 1 In 1662, the “Great Turk Coffee House” opened, “Apparently, inside could be found a bust of Sultan Almurath IV himself, ‘the most detestable tyrant that ever ruled the Ottoman Empire.’ The customer could not only find coffee, tea and tobacco here, but also chocolate and a range of sherbets, which, according to the Mercurius Publicus (12-19 March 1662), were ‘made in Turkie; made of lemons, roses, and violets perfumed.’” 5 Not only did the coffee catch on among the people but so did some of the Turkish cultures. Some people began to wear turbans in the coffee houses. Possibly because of the Islamic culture, and for other reasons, coffee houses were viewed as a place for renegades of Christianity. The new interest in other cultures continued past the fascination of the Middle East all of the ways to the Orient. The Georgian period is marked by an Asian influence in art, literature, and academics. Coffee houses caught on very quickly, so by 1663, there were more than 83 coffee houses in London. By the beginning of the eighteenth century, there were as many as five or six hundred.2 The Prussian nobleman Baron Charles Louis von Pollnitz, who visited London in 1728, described them as one of the great pleasures of the city. He describes how it is “a Sort of Rule with the English, to go once a Day at least” to coffee-houses “where they talk of Business and News, read the Papers, and often look at one another.” 2 Some very famous companies even started as coffee houses. Lloyds of London, an insurance brokerage company, began as Edward Lloyd’s coffee house on Tower Street around 1688. Today when we think of a coffee shop, we think of Starbucks. However, the coffee shops of the past were drastically different from their Middle Eastern culture. One thing they have in common is the social aspect, a place for discussion of new ideas, and that is what we’ll look at next month. The coffee house, which originated in the Middle East around 1511, began simply as a place to enjoy an exotic drink, coffee, but soon evolved into a place that helped change the course of history. Before coffee houses arrived in London, the normal social gathering place was a pub or tavern. The first attraction to coffee might have been its newness or the exhilaration from the caffeine, but it quickly became another reason to meet, and the coffee house became a place for socializing. A traveler to London in 1668 remarked, “Coffee-Houses, which are very numerous in London, are extremely convenient. You have all manner of news there; you have a good Fire, which you may sit by as long as you please; you have a Dish of Coffee; you meet your Friends for the transaction of Business, and all for a penny, if you don’t care to spend more.” 4 Some men spent so much time there that their mail was delivered directly to the coffee house! An interesting fact is that almost every coffee house allowed only male patrons, women being relegated to the home or elsewhere for coffee. Not allowing women into these coffee houses did cause a few problems, which were outlined in the “Women’s Petition Against Coffee” published in 1674. Really a mock petition, but rumors and claims against coffee drinking could have been taken seriously whether or not they were true. And as stated in the previous quote, they charged only a penny for a cup of black coffee! This gave rise to their nickname, “Penny Universities.”![Womens Petition Against Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/womens-petition-against-coffee1.D2QbWt0C_Z14mY8P.webp)_Women’s Petition Against Coffee_ Soon there emerged a distinct difference between the pub and the coffee house, “Rumors of the health benefits of coffee were abundant, and coffee-houses encouraged sobriety, rational thought, and articulate political discussion, whereas taverns merely provided a haven for irreverence and intoxication.” 5 This wasn’t a place to escape the world and dull the senses, but rather a place to debate current events and create new ideas for how life should be. Until this time there did not exist a forum for the merchant or trading class to have such discussions. The London Stock Exchange began with this atmosphere of bringing buyers and sellers together, setting market prices. The famous insurance underwriter, Lloyd’s of London, began in 1688 in a coffee house with Lloyd providing a free information service on shipping, publishing “Lloyd’s List.” It prospered as a place for marine insurance.6 And as far as politics are concerned, men met in the coffee house to discuss hot political topics, even stirring up fear in the king. Some of our founding fathers may have sat in these coffee houses discussing the future of the colonies or how government should be, noting the pitfalls or failures of the monarchies of England and France. In 1675 King Charles II of England wrote a proclamation to have all of the coffee houses shut down; however, after a struggle with the owners of the coffee houses and other businessmen the proclamation was overturned. Almost as quickly as they sprang up, the London coffee houses began to decline. They… > _“had served their purpose and were no longer needed as meeting places for political or literary criticism and debate. They had seen the nation pass through one of its greatest periods of trial and tribulation; had fought and won the battle for individual freedom; had acted as a steadying influence in an age of profligacy; and had given us a standard of prose-writing and literary criticism unequalled before or since.” 7_ In the 1500s the worldwide coffee revolution began, and well after the decline of the London coffee house emerged a new generation, the “Starbucks Revolution.” ### Proclamation for the Suppression of Coffee-Houses Source: Ellis, Aytoun. The Penny University: A History of the Coffee-Houses. (London: Seeker & Warburg, 1956) 92. BY THE KING: A PROCLAMATION FOR THE SUPPRESSION OF COFFEE HOUSES CHARLES R. > _Whereas it is most apparent that the multitude of Coffee-houses of late years set up and kept within this Kingdom, the Dominion of Wales, and Town of Berwick upon Tweed, and the great resort of Idle and disaffected persons to them, have produced very evil and dangerous effects: as well for that many Tradesmen and others, do therein misspend much of their time, which might and probably would otherwise be imployed in and about their Lawful Callings and Affairs; but also, for that in such Houses…divers False, Halitious and Scandalous Reports are devised and spread abroad, to the Defamation of His Majestie’s Government, and to the disturbance of the Peace and Quiet of the Realm; His Majesty hath thought it fit and necessary, That the said Coffee-Houses be (for the future) Put down and Suppressed, and doth…Strictly Charge and Command all manner of persons, That they or any of them do not presume from and after the Tenth Day of January next ensuing, to keep any Publick Coffee-house, or to Utter or sell by retail, in his, her or their house or houses (to be spent or consumed within the same) any Coffee, Chocolet, Sherbett or Tea, as they will answer the contrary at their utmost perils…(All licenses formerly granted to be revoked)._> _Given at our court at Whitehall, this Nine-and-twentieth day of December 1675, in the Seven and twentieth year of Our Reign._> _GOD SAVE THE KING_### The Espresso Revolution Just as coffee houses spread all over Europe in the 17th century, they were also opened in America in the late 17th century. The Merchant’s Coffee House in Philadelphia, also known as the City Tavern, was the meeting place of some of the finest gentlemen of the time, including Washington, Jefferson, Franklin, Lafayette, and John Adams. The Tontine Coffee House in New York, in a similar fashion to Lloyds of London, became the home of the New York Stock Exchange. Not only were the coffee houses places of intellectual trading, but hubs of business and opportunity. As coffee became more widely used and known, there arose many new inventions pertaining to the process of brewing coffee. So many, in fact, that there is a museum in London (the Bramah Museum of Tea & Coffee [www.teaandcoffeemuseum.co.uk](http://www.teaandcoffeemuseum.co.uk)) that is filled with these devices. The original European and American coffee houses served traditional black coffee brewed by steeping the grounds in near-boiling water, but in the early 1900s there came about a new method that would revolutionize the coffee industry. In Italy, Luigi Bezzera filed a patent for a machine that pushed steam and water through a “group” that held the coffee grounds in a filter. Later this patent was purchased by Desiderio Pavoni, and in 1905 the Pavoni company began manufacturing machines based on the Bezzera patent. In 1927 the first espresso machine was brought to America. This La Pavoni machine is still on display at the place where it was first installed, Caffe Reggio in New York, with the title of “Home of the Original Cappuccino.” Although this method increased the speed dramatically, from a brewing time of 4 minutes to about 20 seconds, hence the name espresso, the coffee tasted bitter because the steam was too hot. Through more fine-tuning of the idea, from Cremonesi to Rosetta Scorza to Achille Gaggia in 1946, we have the piston lever espresso machine. The Gaggia Coffee Bar in Italy was the first location to use these machines and to offer espresso along with regular coffee. The modern age of coffee houses was born. And today, we have super-automatic machines that can do everything, grinding the coffee and pouring the completed drink into the glass. It is these super-automatic machines that Starbucks relies on every day. The espresso machine and the Italian coffee house were two ingredients necessary to the formation of the coffee house giant, Starbucks, but oddly enough, Starbucks did not start out having anything to do with espresso. Named after Starbuck, the coffee-loving first mate in Herman Melville’s Moby Dick, the company started out as a roaster and retailer of coffee beans, located in Seattle’s busy Pike Place Market. Starbucks Coffee, Tea, & Spice sold high-quality coffee makers, from Hammarplast, for patrons to use at home, but focused on roasting high-quality coffee beans from regions around the world and not on preparing the coffee. Their mentor was Alfred Peet who had his store, Peet’s Coffee & Tea, in Berkeley, CA, which was also only a roaster and retailer of fine Arabica beans. As their customer base grew, Howard Schultz, the VP and US manager for Hammarplast, took notice of their quickly increasing sales numbers and soon paid them a visit. By this time Starbucks already had four stores in the Seattle area, was profitable every year, and was buying more from Hammarplast than Macy’s. Schultz was so impressed by the founder’s passion and authenticity that he even stated there was something magic about the place, and so he wanted to go to Seattle and work for them. It took over a year of courting before they finally agreed to let him take over as head of marketing. A couple of years after he was hired to this position the company sent him to Milan, Italy, to attend a trade show. While he was walking from his hotel to the convention he discovered something – the Italian coffee house, which actually in Italy is a coffee bar. There was Italian opera music playing in the background, the smiling barista making the espresso drinks and socializing with the clientele, and surprisingly very few chairs. He was struck by a large number of coffee bars in this town and how they were all bustling with activity. He was inspired and brought his passion back to Seattle, where it was met with great distaste and resistance. Starbucks was a roaster, not a restaurant or bar; the beverage business would distract them from its mission as a coffee retailer. The answer, is “NO.” At the same time, the owners were excited about the opportunity that had opened up to purchase Peet’s Coffee and Tea, which they did. Now traveling back and forth between the companies, Schultz still pursued the idea of a coffee bar. After a year, they finally agreed to allow an espresso machine in one location, and that day they served 400 people, well above their 250 customer average. In two months it grew to 800 people and the lines stretched outside the door. Even though this success, the original owners did not want to pursue this venture. Schultz decided the only thing he could do was leave and start his own company, Il Giornale Coffee Company. It did great and quickly grew to three profitable stores.![Starbucks Original Store Pike Place Market](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/original-starbucks-store-pike.BoryGBpf_2kFYYN.webp)_Starbucks Original Store Pike Place Market_ In April of 1987 the owners of Starbucks decided to sell the business, one owner wanted to cash out and the other was going to focus on Peet’s Coffee & Tea, and he said that Peet’s was original and it was better. Schultz knew that he needed to purchase Starbucks, and after raising enough capital he did, afterward changing the name of all of his Il Giornale coffee bars into Starbucks. His vision, dedication, and leadership skills propelled Starbucks into the world-class company it has become. ### References 1,2) [Coffee House, The \[Coffee-House\] (1652)](https://www.litencyc.com/php/stopics.php?rec=true&#x26;UID=5512) (Henri Misson, pp. 39-40). 1.

# The Coffee Song [Coffee People](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/coffee-people/)---by [Michael Allen Smith](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/michael-allen-smith/) I thought I was a Frank Sinatra fan, but somehow, this tune escaped me. Back in 1946, Frank Sinatra sang _The Coffee Song_. Bob Hilliard wrote the lyrics and Dick Miles did the music.**The Coffee Song as performed by Frank Sinatra.**> Way down among Brazilians Coffee beans grow by the billions So they’ve got to find those extra cups to fill They’ve got an awful lot of coffee in Brazil You can’t get cherry soda ’cause they’ve got to sell their quota And the way things are I’ll bet they never will They’ve got a zillion tons of coffee in Brazil No tea or tomato juice You’ll see no potato juice Cause the planters down in Santos all say no no no A politician’s daughter was accused of drinking water And was fined a great big fifty dollar bill They’ve got an awful lot of coffee in Brazil And when their ham and eggs need savor Coffee ketchup gives ’em flavor Coffee pickles way outsell the dill Why they put coffee in the coffee in Brazil No tea or tomato juice You’ll see no potato juice Cause the planters down in Santos all say no no no So your lead to the local color Serving coffee with a cruller Dunking doesn’t take a lot of skill They’ve got an awful lot of coffee in Brazil Man, they got a gang of coffee in Brazil. Many song lyric databases include the following lines, which were not in the Frank Sinatra version. > You date a girl and find out later she smells just like a percolator Her perfume was made right on the grill Why they could percolate the ocean in Brazil Don’t ask for hot cocoa there They’ll say you’ve gone loco there But say caffeine or coffee bean and they’ll say ay ay ay This song appears on several Frank Sinatra releases.![Frank Sinatra Coffee Song](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/frank-sinatra-coffee-song1.Cy3Lnvkp_113GA9.webp) ### Sources [Bob Hilliard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Hilliard) – Wikipedia page.

# The Cosori Pour Over Coffee Maker [Brewing Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/brewing-coffee/)---by [Michael Allen Smith](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/michael-allen-smith/)![The Cosori Pour Over Coffee Maker](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/the-cosori-pour-over-coffee-maker/Cosori-Pour-Over-Coffee-Maker.jpg) I immediately noticed the resemblance when I first saw the Cosori Pour Over Coffee Maker. It looks a lot like a Chemex except that the brewer is set up to use a metal cone filter instead of a paper filter. Why would you use a metal filter instead of the thick Chemex paper filter? Three reasons come to mind. First, some prefer coffee that tastes richer with all the oils, like the French Press. Second, you’ll never accidentally run out of filters. And third, you’ll save money by not having to buy paper filters. Look at the photo below. On the left is the Cosori and on the right is a Chemex. Separated at birth?![cosori and chemex](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/cosori-and-chemex.Bc-WSAZv_Z1utp8X.webp)_Left: Cosori, Right: Chemex_![cosori setup](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/cosori-setup.BCi1cLAj_HC04g.webp)_Cosori set up_![cosori filter](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/cosori-filter.Ch69i4o6_1aefwN.webp)_The Cosori has five small holes at the bottom of its metal cone filter._### Tutorial This is usually the part of the article where we here at INeedCoffee put together a step-by-step guide on how to brew coffee with the brewer being discussed. But we don’t need to this time because the steps to brew pour-over coffee with the Cosori are basically the same as those for the Chemex, with the exception that you don’t have to fuss with a paper filter. For guidance, see [Chemex Coffee Brewing—History and Tutorial](https://ineedcoffee.com/chemex-coffee-brewing-history-and-tutorial/) or follow the instructions clearly written on the side of the Cosori box.![pour over cosori](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/cosori-pour-water.Dl_SDt-X_ZohYzI.webp)![cosori front](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/cosori-front.BSPA1OuF_Z2rJLHD.webp) ### Review You would purchase the Cosori because you like the design and need a pour-over coffee maker capable of making a lot of coffee at once. If you are making coffee for yourself, getting any generic Pour Over Coffee Dripper Stainless Steel that brews directly into your cup would be a better option and take up less counter space. However, if you like the design and you are the type of coffee drinker who wants the coffee with all the oils in a “Chemex-like” glass container, consider the Cosori. The glass is thick, and I like the handle as much as the handle on my Chemex. The clean-up is easy as well. At the time of this writing, one costs under $30, whereas an 8-cup Chemex is closer to $50. On a side note, the metal filter included in the Cosori also fits the Chemex. I don’t believe Cosori sells the metal filter separately. Still, others sell similar stainless steel metal cone filters that I’m sure you could drop into your Chemex if you wanted to try to make coffee like a Cosori. ### Resources [Chemex Coffee Brewing – History and Tutorial](https://ineedcoffee.com/chemex-coffee-brewing-history-and-tutorial/) – INeedCoffee article for Chemex.

# The Coffee Siphon – The Simple Tutorial [Brewing Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/brewing-coffee/)---by [Michael Allen Smith](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/michael-allen-smith/)![The Coffee Siphon – The Simple Tutorial](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/the-coffee-siphon-the-simple-tutorial/coffee-siphon.jpg) A few months ago, I received a wonderful gift: a coffee siphon. Although the siphon may appear intimidating at first glance, it is really easy to brew excellent coffee with it. There are more comprehensive guides out there, but this is a simple one to get you started with the basics. ### #1 Measure and Grind The most common dosage recommendation for vacuum pot coffee is 8 grams of coffee for every four ounces of water. The grind will be slightly finer than that for drip coffee. See the [Coffee Grind Chart](https://ineedcoffee.com/coffee-grind-chart/) for a visual approximation. ### #2 Pre-Heat the Water You could apply the siphon flame directly to cold water, but it takes forever and wastes butane. I use an electric kettle to bring the water up to about 180°F. While the water is warming up, close the filter on the top chamber of the siphon by latching the chain hook to the edge of the glass tube. Once this is in place, add the ground coffee to the top chamber.![siphon start](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/siphon-start1.CpFF_lDw_189fhx.webp)_Add ground coffee to the top chamber._![siphon filter](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/siphon-filter.DnECVJu2_Z29nESO.webp)_Make sure the filter is latched in place._### #3 Secure the Siphon Together Place the top chamber securely into the bottom glass chamber.![siphon secure](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/siphone-secure.BrCnVfjx_yVt7N.webp)_After adding water to the bottom chamber, connect the top chamber to the bottom._### #4 Light the Flame Turn the knob on the heating element to release gas and then press the pedal to ignite the blue flame. This will provide enough heat to complete the brewing cycle.![siphon flame](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/siphon-flame.DEEwVeM8_ZDcfBW.webp)_Turn on the burner._### #5 Brew and Stir The water from the bottom chamber will rise to the top. Once there, gently stir so all the coffee grounds contact the water. Allow the brew cycle to run for 60-90 seconds and then turn off the flame.![siphon brewing](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/siphon-brewing.D1rtmgCz_1a7tua.webp)_Water will rise from the bottom chamber to the top._![siphon turn off flame](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/siphon-turn-off-flame.Z_Qj2HB7_1kgQXv.webp)_Turn off the flame after the coffee has brewed for 60-90 seconds in the top chamber._### #6 Allow Coffee to Return to the Lower Chamber and Serve Once the flame is removed, the coffee will flood into the bottom chamber.

# The Decaf Diaries [Cafe Culture](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/cafe-culture/)---by [Laura K Baker](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/laura-k-baker/)![The Decaf Diaries](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/the-decaf-diaries/sunny-decaf-latte1.jpg) What? Decaf? On INeedCoffee?! I know, I know. Just get it out of your system. Throw something at me. Yell. Call me names. I deserve it. If it makes you feel any better, you should know that I’ve been similarly flogging myself for the five years that I’ve been drinking (gasp!) decaffeinated coffee. It all started when I got pregnant. No coffee is still the conservative approach to that situation, so I, being a nervous first-time mother, did my duty and laid off my beloved coffee. I somewhat strategically chose to end my affair over my week’s vacation at the beach, thinking that having very few other pressures and certainly no pressing need to be awake would help with the endeavor. It was still a horrible, horrible week. I felt like complete garbage. I had a week-long, pulsating headache. I grumbled at everyone. I slept ungodly hours. And I was basically mad for seven days straight. After that terrible week, though, came all the wonders of being pregnant. During my nine months, I attempted to fill the coffee void by making hot chocolate in the morning – no good, too sweet. Then chai tea with lots of cream – nope, something about the cinnamon wasn’t working for me. Decaf tea? Well, that just plain tastes like bitter twigs. I would like to emphasize the fact that, for my entire pregnancy, I did not have one cup of coffee. Not one cup of regular coffee, _or_ one cup of decaf. _Who drinks decaf?_ I thought. _Only weenies drink decaf._ I’d rather go without, I determined, for forty weeks and two long days.![Sunny Decaf Latte](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/sunny-decaf-latte1.B3t9JK2p_Z16JT8S.webp)_Sunny Decaf Latte_### Part Deux When we last met, I was pregnant, abstaining from all coffee beverages of any kind. And so I spent forty weeks and two days without a single cup from the beautiful bean. It wasn’t until I had a newborn at home and I learned what true sleep deprivation means that I reconsidered the whole coffee thing again. There was some combination of events that led to my first shameful sip of decaf. I realized I needed some form of artificial stimulation somewhere around baby week 5 – I was flat beat. But I was nursing and felt strongly that I should avoid too much caffeine. My doctor said that he had been off caffeine for some years now and that he could get a small buzz from a good cup of decaffeinated espresso. _Ah-ha_, I thought. Just the word espresso brought vivid happiness to my brain. I recalled my first shot: I was in college, on my way to my Honors Program oral exam. The whole situation was probably as snobby and full of affectation as could be in a small, private liberal arts college, but I loved every minute of it. I was about to sit in front of my Postmodern Philosophy professor: a tall, dark, rail-thin man that just oozed Euro-trash, but was from upstate New York I think. We all loved him. And wanted desperately to impress him. So, on my walk across the Gothic campus, I stopped at the coffee stand and said, “Single Espresso. Straight.” I relayed my virginal-espresso experience to my professor before the exam began. I made an A. So that’s how it started. Far from that Philadelphia campus, I was now an un-caffeinated mother of a one-month-old. And I desperately needed a little happy drink to keep the raging mommy monster from destroying my home, my friends, and my sweet baby. So I started drinking decaf. In the morning at my house. And at every coffee shop, I could find. And I have to say, those cups of coffee “despite being decaf” made me a much happier mama. A funny thing happened when I was no longer a new mother and I was finally free to drink a good, strong cup of coffee again. I found myself facing some pretty deep-seated anxiety. I had visions of that first cup of full-octane coffee. Like motor oil compared to the crap I was drinking. Because let’s be straight, ladies and gentlemen, decaf tastes terrible. There is absolutely no mistaking decaf coffee from the real thing. None. It has a weird, almost sticky after-taste. I still taste it, after five years. Despite all my rationalizations for why I drink the stuff, please remember, it’s still pretty bad. But faced with the straight dark roast, I was afraid. I had visions of drinking that first lovely cup, and dropping the white porcelain mug halfway through, as I (in slow motion of course – this is all in my mind, remember) took big leaps toward the bathroom to throw up. Repeatedly. I also was goaded by the demons from my week of detox. It’s true. I was afraid of how addicted I had been to coffee. So here I am today. Proud mother of a happy four-year-old. Still drinking decaf. And averting my eyes as I order my drink from the coffee shop. I slink out the door, clutching my “coffee,” and slipping my sunglasses on as quickly as possible, hoping never to be recognized by any of my philosophy comrades. So the question remains: why should you read anything I write even though decaf sucks? Because I agree with you. Decaf sucks! And I would know better than anyone – I’ve been drinking the stuff in a variety of states, sampling cups from large and small shops all over the country. It doesn’t even smell as good as the real stuff. (Okay, I may be making that one up, but I can’t be expected to be rational; I drink _decaf_ for god’s sake). There’s nothing that has been able to take the place of coffee in my life. And for right now, it just has to be decaf. And so here I am, on the front lines. Ready to report, honestly, on the circumstances of decaf beverages “and fellow decaf-drinkers” everywhere. (At least until I summon the courage to face my first strong brew).

# The Espro Press Overview [Brewing Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/brewing-coffee/)---by [Chris Arnold](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/chris-arnold/)![The Espro Press Overview](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/the-espro-press-overview/espro-press.jpg) The Espro Press is a beautiful piece of coffee gear to be sure, but what about the actual coffee that comes out of the thing? Espro claims the Espro Press is “Arguably the first major breakthrough in coffee press design in over 30 years!” While that is certainly debatable, the Espro brings a few things to the table. At first glance, it is very similar to a traditional French Press, with some key differences: 1. Insulated Stainless Steel Double-Walled Vacuum vessel, which, unlike a Glass French Press, keeps your coffee hot for a lot longer and is much more rugged. 2. Double fine filters, that promise to keep more fines out of your cup, unlike a traditional French press.![Espro Press Box](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/espro-press-box1.BNkur69a_2oxk7v.webp) ### Body Although I like the flavor of French Press coffee, I generally avoid it because the additional oils tend to give me heartburn and jitters. So I had to break out one of my dusty Bodum French press pots for comparison to the 32-ounce Espro version I was using.![Espro Press](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/espro-press.CNEj26U3_Z1rBGgd.webp) I followed the recommendations of Espro to [grind coarse](https://ineedcoffee.com/coffee-grind-chart/), and I chose 205F degree water. I went with stirring halfway through and about 4-minute extraction. The resulting cup was on par with the Bodum in terms of taste and oil content. And sure enough, the amount of “fines” or mud at the bottom was about half that of the Bodum; but there was still a fair bit of mud. And though I tried a couple more times using their troubleshooting tips, it didn’t really change this aspect much. Still, half the mud is a good thing. 15 Minutes after steeping, I poured more coffee out, and it was still quite hot, which was a nice difference from a non-insulated French press. This is great when you are enjoying your coffee over a long breakfast or multiple drinkers getting their coffee over an extended period of time. After about 30 minutes, it started to cool below what I would call drinkable. Also, I preheat the vessel with boiling water for a few minutes before starting to brew, which I think helps with heat retention, especially with metal vessels. I did notice a small difference in flavor between the Espro and the Bodum, and I favored the Bodum slightly. I am guessing this is because of metal vs glass, and perhaps the Espro metal imparted something that changed the flavor, though I suspect the metal is probably coated to prevent this. I have yet to meet a metal coffee vessel that didn’t impart some additional flavor that I didn’t care for. Cleanup of the Espro was slightly more involved than the Bodum but only took a few extra seconds, mainly to brush the filters with a soft brush.![Espro Top](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/espro-top.CK2XKOEM_2iWtcj.webp)![Espro](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/espro.CKO322NO_ZVYh9M.webp) ### Conclusion The Espro is an ample performer and comes in an 18-ounce size and a 32-ounce size. While the price is a step up, the Espro will appeal to those looking for not just a very good coffee press that delivers less coffee sediment in the cup but also a beautiful, rugged work of art suitable to take on your next camping trip, or as the centerpiece of your breakfast table.**Pros**- Beautiful, rugged design - Keeps coffee hotter much longer than a traditional glass French Press - Fewer coffee fines in your cup - It can be used for tea, though it was not tested. - Filters are BPA, BPS, and phthalate-free.**Cons**- Step-up in price. - The metal interior may be a turn-off for those who prefer the neutral taste of glass. - Cleanup is a little longer than a traditional French press. ### Resources [French Press Tutorial](https://ineedcoffee.com/press-pot-tutorial/) – INeedCoffee tutorial on French press coffee._Disclosure: INeedCoffee was sent this product at no cost, which did not affect its review._ Published on June 1, 2013--- #### Chris Arnold Chris is the creator of Two Bit History.

# The Hamilton Beach Cool Touch Tea Kettle Review [Brewing Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/brewing-coffee/)---by [Michael Allen Smith](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/michael-allen-smith/) Recently, I decided to trade in my plastic electric kettle for a stainless steel one. I wanted an electric tea kettle with no exposed plastic parts. In the article “Avoiding Plastic—3 Stainless Steel Electric Kettle Options,” I highlighted three affordable stainless steel kettle options. I selected the Hamilton Beach 40898 Cool Touch Tea Kettle for my needs. Here is my review. The lid is not attached when the Hamilton Beach Cool Touch Tea Kettle is shipped, so it was not intuitive for me to attach it. I misplaced the instructions and ended up calling the Hamilton Beach support line. I spoke to an apathetic lady who seemed to have no clue what product I was discussing. I repeated the name several times to her and got no help. Eventually, I figured out how to snap the lid onto the kettle. To connect the lid, it must be vertical and set down so the right edge of the lid evenly dissects the center of the open space. Push it down until it snaps. Don’t be tempted to discard the lid. I attempted to boil water without a lid and discovered that the heating element did not turn off. **In order for the kettle to stop boiling water, the lid must be fastened and closed, or you will need to shut it off manually.**![Cool Touch Kettle](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/cool-touch-kettle1.8nt3WcII_gccff.webp)_Hamilton Beach Cool Touch with open lid. This is how you want to pour. The lid needs to be completely vertical to fasten._ The _Hamilton Beach Cool Touch Tea Kettle_ does have a plastic lip where water can be poured. I use the word “could” because you can bypass the plastic by pushing the button and opening the lid fully while pouring. This prevents the water from making contact with the plastic. Just be careful not to have any exposed fingers over the lid area, or hot steam could burn you. The _Cool Touch_ has a nice feature that allows you to hide the excess power cord underneath the base. This will keep the cord from taking over your kitchen counter. See the photo below.![underneath kettle](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/hamilton-beach-kettle-underneath.BW79FrOs_1z9Rb4.webp)_Hiding excess cord underneath the heating element._ The _Hamilton Beach Cool Touch Kettle_ has a green light that indicates when it is powered on. Green makes more sense than [Bodum’s use of red](https://ineedcoffee.com/extending-the-life-of-your-bodum-cordless-electric-kettle/).![tea kettle light](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/tea-kettle-light.CVNgzYna_ZjPzVA.webp)_Green means Go or ON._ How fast does this kettle heat water? **The Hamilton Beach Cool Touch Kettle brought 16 ounces of water to a rolling boil and powered off in just 2 minutes and 30 seconds.** This is the exact time I got from the Bodum plastic kettle. That is smoking fast. I usually stop it before it hits 2 minutes. It is louder than the Bodum plastic kettle, but I like that, as I am starting to use sound to indicate water temperature. I want hotter water for French press coffee and cooler water for green tea. The louder the kettle, the hotter the water.**Calibrating the Water Temperature** I don’t want the water to boil when I brew tea. I keep the lid open and drop in a long thermometer. This allows me to easily monitor the temperature and shut off the heating element exactly where I want. Over time, I have learned to watch the water closely to gauge temperature. Tiny bubbles are good for green tea, mid-sized bubbles for oolong tea, and above that, ideal for coffee, black tea, and puer tea. Besides Hamilton Beach’s terrible phone support and the clumsy lid assembly, I love the _Hamilton Beach Cool Touch Tea Kettle_. Hopefully, you won’t have trouble installing the lid and never need to dial up the support line. I highly endorse this product. The Hamilton Beach 40898 Cool-Touch Cordless 8 Cup Electric Kettle can heat up to 64 ounces. ### Resources [Avoiding Plastic – 3 Stainless Steel electric Kettle Options](https://ineedcoffee.com/avoiding-plastic-3-stainless-steel-electric-kettle-options/) – Overview of Adagio Teas 3, Breville SK500XL, and Hamilton Beach Cool Touch tea kettles.

# The Frieling French Press Review [Brewing Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/brewing-coffee/)---by [Joseph Robertson](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/joseph-robertson/)![The Frieling French Press Review](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/the-frieling-french-press/frieling-french-press-coffee1.jpg) The Frieling French Press is a high-end stainless steel french press coffee brewer. There are a variety of sizes including 8, 17, 23, 36, and 44 ounces. For this article, a 44-ounce Frieling was used. One of the pluses of this stainless steel press is that all of the internals are steel as well. Most, if not all, of the other steel French presses contain plastic on the inside (and, in some cases, rubber-like gasket material for sealing the side walls with the filter as you press). The press mechanism for the Frieling is just like a glass French press – all metal and the sides are sealed off simply by pressing the metal filter up against them. The Frieling is also double-walled – this means that it is designed to hold in heat. It does this VERY well. The first time I used the press, I forgot that I was brewing it. I accidentally left it on the counter for 4 hours. When I came back, I took the opportunity to measure the temperature of the coffee and discovered that even after 4 hours, the coffee was still at a perfectly hot 132 degrees F. I wouldn’t recommend sitting on a French press for 4 hours, but it is great to be able to brew a large amount and know that I can enjoy a few cups over a period of time without having to rush.![Frieling French Press](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/frieling-french-press-coffee1.D2SvZgeY_Z1XVwh8.webp)_Frieling French Press_ I enjoyed the Frieling over Thanksgiving, where we all sat down to a nice family gathering. After the meal, I prepared coffee for the 4 of us. The beautiful construction of the press was perfect alongside the fine place settings at the table – this is a plus for anyone looking to have a nice high-quality brewer for big gatherings. Aside from its ability to hold heat, one of the most impressive things about the Frieling that I found is the way the handle is designed, it is balanced perfectly. This Frieling I used was the 12 cup – 44 oz press. Now you can imagine, that a large metal press filled with 12 cups of water and coffee is likely to get heavy. It was not light, but it was so incredibly easy to pour that you wouldn’t think you were holding a gigantic pot of coffee.![Frieling French Press](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/frieling-french-press.C9BVKBu3_1U8BRQ.webp) One of the strange downsides I discovered is that the press filter fits VERY snuggly due to the internal all-metal construction. One must be extremely careful not to force the filter in too hard after filling up the press. The first time I did this, I was trying to put the press top on by pushing the filter in first – I had to apply pressure (due to the snug nature of the filter), and then it popped in suddenly and splashed a bunch of coffee out. I discovered how I probably should have been capping the press differently – you simply place the filter on top and then press down on the cap itself, which fits the filter in snuggly. Also, because the filter is so snug, it takes a bit more pressure than usual to press the pot all the way down. I found at certain points that I actually had to apply a much higher level of pressure than I would have thought to press the pot fully. I don’t know if the tiny openings in the filter, along with the hard seal on the side, made it necessary to apply the pressure, but I was surprised. A simple fix for this was to just press slower. Eventually, you get through the press.![pour coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/pour-coffee.D9Z9-yAO_Z1fcuQC.webp) One more note about the filter—I believe, though I haven’t been able to confirm this 100%, that the metal mesh filter in the Frielings is finer than a typical French press. I do believe that the cups I enjoyed from this French press were a bit cleaner than I have experienced in standard glass French presses.![Coffee and Pie](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/coffee-and-pie.CSBavoua_Z2h1433.webp) All in all, it’s a beautiful press pot that makes a fantastic cup of coffee that will stay hot. It is extremely well made and durable – the only part I could see having to replace ever would be the filtering mechanism (which is easily removable). The only real potential downside to this press pot is that it costs considerably more than a standard glass French press. However, if it fits in your price range, I honestly believe it’s worth it. This is a French press that will last for many, many years._This article first appeared in issue 13 of Extracted Magazine, which is available on iTunes._### Resources [Buying a French Press – Picking the Right One](https://ineedcoffee.com/buying-a-french-press-picking-the-right-one/) – Our French Press purchasing guide.

# The History of Greek-Style Frappe [Coffee History](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/coffee-history/)---by [Daniel Young](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/daniel-young/)![The History of Greek-Style Frappe](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/the-history-of-greek-style-frappe/History-of-Greek-Style-Frappe.jpg) According to popular legend, the Greek-style frappe was invented in September 1957 at the annual Thessaloniki International Fair in the convention center of Greece’s second-largest city. Working at an exhibit for Andreas Dritsas, then the Greek distributor of Nestle products, sales representative Dimitrios Vakondios made an important discovery. Reportedly, there was no hot water available. Maybe he merely desired cold refreshment. Either way, Vakondios grabbed a shaker meant for Nesquik, the Nestle cocoa drink, filled it instead with Nescafe instant coffee and a little cold water, and shook it vigorously. Not accounting for the burst of foam this action would generate, Vakondios achieved two results: The first outcome was the staining of his business suit; the second was the invention of the foamy concoction that would become something akin to the identity soft drink of Greece.![greek frappe](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/cream1.DJWeUL36_2pNjOp.webp)_Greek Frappe_ The hallmark of a Greek frappe is a foam so sensationally frothy that it resembles cream. Coffee foams, such as the crema atop espresso, are generally produced by the proteins in the coffee. These proteins act as surfactants (surface-active agents) that form a thin elastic membrane on the liquid’s surface area and entrap air. The main advantage of instant coffee over brewed fresh coffee for foaming is that it can be prepared in a highly concentrated solution. When that solution is shaken, lots of proteins line the bubbles that form and help produce a thick, durable foam. In both its powdered and granular forms, instant coffee is basically brewed coffee that has been dried to remove most of its water. The amount of water added back to it can be carefully controlled. A small quantity of water can be used to produce the foam. Then more water or milk can be added afterward to dilute some of the foam, filling the cup or glass beneath it with drinkable coffee liquid. A dense extract made with instant coffee and water in a weight-per-volume concentration as high as 6 percent provides an abundance of protein molecules to surround the bubbles as they form.![Dimitrios Vakondios](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/vakondios.DzXDwKpt_ZeMooP.webp)_Dimitrios Vakondios_ Where, when, and how this drink assumed the name frappe is uncertain. Soon after its invention, a form of this frothy cold coffee was promoted by Nestle at the Contemporary Home Exhibition at the Zappeion convention center in Athens. But a Nestle company promotional brochure from around that period, written in Greek, detailed a slightly different recipe: > Put in a mixer 2 cups Nestle evaporated milk, 1 cup water, 2 teaspoons Nescafe, and 1 scoop vanilla ice cream. Mix a few seconds and serve*.* This formula took after the French classic cafe frappe, made with ice cream, as much as the Greek one, which acquires its foam and fullness without ice cream. By 1963, ice cream was no longer a part of Nescafe’s frappe equation. A print ad from that year carried a bold illustration of a glass with an exceedingly thick head of light-colored foam over a dark liquid. That this was what Greeks came to know as a milkless “_frappe horis gala”_, albeit a rather top-heavy one, there can be little doubt. The ad copy linked _“Nescafe”_ and _“frappe”_ and revealed these simple instructions for preparing a frappe coffee: > All you have to do is beat Nescafe, sugar, and cold water.![Nescafe Ad](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/nescafe-classic-ad.DN7WZ_D0_1uxXz0.webp)_Nescafe Ad_### Resources [Greek Frappe Recipe](https://ineedcoffee.com/greek-frappe-recipe/) – The Greek Frappe recipe is here on INeedCoffee.

# The History of Instant Coffee [Coffee History](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/coffee-history/)---by [Stefanie Spencer](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/stefanie-spencer/)![The History of Instant Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/the-history-of-instant-coffee/history-of-instant-coffee.jpg) We all have seen and possibly used instant coffee at some point in our lives, but have you ever wondered where this dark, mysterious, water-soluble powder gained its popularity? Some might snub their noses at it today, but it has proven to us in the past that it is always ready when we need it most! The earliest version of instant coffee is said to have been invented around 1771 in Britain. The first American product was developed in 1853, and an experimental version (in cake form) was field-tested during the Civil War. In 1890, David Strang of Invercargill, New Zealand, invented and patented instant coffee. ¹  In 1901, Sartori Kato invented the first successful technique for manufacturing a stable powdered product in Japan, which he used for making instant tea. ² The first time instant coffee powder was mass-produced was in America around 1910 by George Constant Louis Washington (not related to President Washington). He accomplished a great feat and acquired a patent, but most perceived it as a novelty with a disagreeable taste. Around 1938, Nescafe became the most popular brand; by co-drying coffee extract along with an equal amount of soluble carbohydrate, they improved the taste. Currently, the best process for retaining the taste is freeze-drying, which came around in the 1960s.![Teaspoon of Instant Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/instant-coffee-teaspoon1.D1daUiRt_JRXvO.webp)_A teaspoon of Instant Coffee by [Andy Straw](https://www.flickr.com/photos/andystraw/)_ This novelty found its niche market in the military. Caffeine consumption on the battlefield provided a much-needed boost, and now this was made much easier with instant coffee. In World War I, some soldiers nicknamed it a “cup of George.” ³ > I am very happy despite the rats, the rain, the mud, the draughts [sic], the roar of the cannon and the scream of shells. It takes only a minute to light my little oil heater and make some George Washington Coffee… Every night I offer up a special petition to the health and well-being of [Mr. Washington]. -American soldier, 1918 letter from the trenches By World War II, instant coffee was incredibly popular among soldiers. G. Washington Coffee, Nescafe, and others had all emerged to meet the demand. One year, the entire production from the U.S. Nescafe plant (over one million cases) went solely to the military. 4 Today, instant coffee still has a force in the market. It is great in recipes like a quick mocha frosting for a cappuccino cookie. In the grocery store, you will see it in all the instant cappuccino drinks and blended ice drink powders, some of which are even used in coffee houses. Even the military still provides instant coffee powder for that much-needed caffeine boost.

# The High-End Micro Lot [Cafe Culture](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/cafe-culture/)---by [Matt Evans](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/matt-evans/)![The High-End Micro Lot](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/the-high-end-micro-lot/2-clover-coffee-machines1.jpg) The exterior is quite unremarkable. After scouring the storefronts along West Randolph Street, I finally spy the “Intelligentsia” sign printed modestly across the slightly tinted front window. Entering slowly, I take stock of the famous Chicago specialty coffeehouse. Inside, it has a nice ambiance, but certainly nothing out of the ordinary: stainless steel, vaulted ceiling, and alternative music playing in the background. I admit I’m being somewhat critical, but my expectations of this leader in the micro-lot specialty coffee industry are high. I tell myself that it’s really about the coffee and shuffle up to the counter. The wide view of the baristas is nice, and I’m sure that the shots are spectacular, but I’m a drip coffee connoisseur, and I can’t wait to taste a great specialty micro-lot brewed in the ultra-high-end Clover system. I order a Cruz Del Sur from Peru and sit down to enjoy my 12-ounce masterpiece. Overall the coffee is light-bodied and elegant, not unlike many South Americans I’ve roasted at home. Certainly better than the local diner or at one of the Starbucks I passed on my way here. Yet, I’m not overwhelmed. As I contemplate my next cup, I notice that there is a premium coffee offered on the Clover menu, at more than double the price of my current cup. The dilemma I’m stuck with is, of course, might a seven-dollar cup of brewed coffee be a little outrageous? Since I don’t get to Chicago all that often, I decide it’s worth the splurge.![2 Clover Coffee Machines](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/2-clover-coffee-machines1.DYOtlLLL_Z2uByFW.webp)_2 Clover Coffee Machines_ I asked the person at the counter if that Kenyan could really be twice as good as the cup I just had, but she just looked at me with a blank stare. She obviously thinks it can. So, with even more anticipation, I ordered the Kenya Ndaroni Auction Lot and carefully brought it back to my table, not wanting to spill a single drop of the precious liquid. My first hint of difference is the bouquet. The wet aroma just about knocks me off my feet with an explosion of honey and citrus. Now, my mouth watering with anticipation, I take a sip. The crisp wine-like taste jumps out at me: pinot gris style. It’s a luscious, thick, grapefruit flavor that resists the urge to descend into tangy sweetness. The full-bodied mouthfeel reminds me not of overly sweet honey from a bottle, but honey right out of the comb that my Dad used to bring in from the hive; deeply rich, bittersweet, and much more complex. I am blown away. Maybe most impressive, the coffee holds its structure as it cools, not wilting as lesser coffees can do as the heat dissipates. The finish is clean and delicious, with tannins that dry out my mouth and make me want to sprint up to the counter for more. I savor each sip, and I am plenty happy with the ambiance and furnishings now.![Aster Coffee Seattle](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/aster-coffee-clover-ritual.BezlYoYZ_GAuyd.webp)_Aster Coffee in Seattle Offers Clover Coffee_ I lean back, happy to have finally tried the next tier up in coffee and found it indeed something special. For years I’ve roasted and brewed my own blends, and there have been precious few times when I’ve found a cup as good as or better than my own. But to a certain extent, I think I had gotten into a rut. I don’t splurge on the twenty or forty dollars a pound beans because my run-of-the-mill six and eight dollars micro-lots taste just fine, thank you. But it had been quite a while since I’d been really blown away by an extraordinary cup. I don’t think I’d buy a seven-dollar cup of coffee every morning, but it sure is nice to know that just like that twenty-five-dollar bottle of wine, it is there for special occasions, and it is amazing.

# The Lazy Person’s Guide to Making Coffee at Home [Brewing Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/brewing-coffee/)---by [Michael Allen Smith](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/michael-allen-smith/)![The Lazy Person’s Guide to Making Coffee at Home](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/the-lazy-persons-guide-to-making-coffee-at-home/lazy-coffee.jpg) I have a friend who loves coffee but doesn’t make it at home. Well, I have several friends who fit that description. They spend a lot of money in coffee shops. For them, making coffee is too much work. Trying to convince them that using an [AeroPress](https://ineedcoffee.com/aeropress-coffee-maker-tutorial/) or the [Bonavita Dripper](https://ineedcoffee.com/step-step-bonavita-immersion-coffee-dripper-tutorial/) is easy is a lost cause. They want to be easy and self-identify as lazy. This got me thinking about what coffee brewing methods are the easiest. They are not going to buy a grinder or anything that takes up counter space, reminding them they are lazy. It needs to be as easy as possible while tasting good enough to compete viably with the coffee shop. I dug through the INeedCoffee archives to uncover the best coffee brewing methods for the lazy coffee drinker. Here they are. ### #1 New Generation Instant Coffee Instant coffee has changed a lot in recent years. It has gotten a lot better. This market is no longer just for legacy bland-tasting blends. Sudden Coffee and Joe Coffee Company make flavorful coffees, including high-quality single-origin offerings such as instant coffee. The new generation of instant coffee is not cheap, but you’ll save time and money compared to going to the coffee shop. Our article [Next Generation Instant Coffee Reviews](https://ineedcoffee.com/camping-showdown-steeped-coffee-vs-bripe-coffee-pipe/) highlights two companies that make outstanding instant coffees. ### #2 Steeped Coffee There are far fewer tea shops than coffee shops. One reason is likely that making tea at home is so easy that justifying a daily or multiple times per day habit will be more difficult. Steeped Coffee leveraged that fact and developed a coffee you brew in a tea bag style. Add hot water, steep it, and remove the coffee bag. For more information, see our article Camping Showdown: Steeped Coffee vs. The Bripe Coffee Pipe. Just avoid the Bripe Coffee Pipe, which might be the worst coffee brewer ever. ### #3 Liquid Pod Coffee Pod-brewers such as Keurig make brewing coffee easy, but they aren’t great. Plus, they take up counter space. There are also concerns about bacteria and mold if they are not regularly cleaned. Most people will clean their coffee gear, but this article is for the lazy coffee drinker. It needs to be easier. Well, Caffè di Artisan solved the problem by creating concentrated coffee pod capsules. Now, you don’t even need a machine. And because you can put the coffee pods in a drawer, no counter space is needed. Caffè di Artisan makes coffees for all types of coffee drinkers. Add hot or cold water if you want an iced coffee experience.![Coffee Pods - Capsules](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/coffee-pods-gel.BgBL-EC7_ZVrFrI.webp) *Caffè di Artisan Coffee Capsules *### #4 Cold Brew Coffee Even though cold-brew coffee might not initially seem like something a lazy coffee drinker would make, I included it on the list because if you make enough at one time, you may only need to brew cold-brew once a week. Typically, I advise buying a decent grinder and grinding coffee just before you brew. However, cold brew is super forgiving. You could have it ground at the cafe or grocery store, take it home, and make excellent coffee with no real loss in flavor. The lazy coffee drinker will want the simplest, easiest-to-clean cold brewer. I’m a fan of the one made by Alkani. In the summer, I might brew once a week. It is easy to clean, too. See The Alkani Cold Brew Coffee Maker— [Review and Tutorial](https://ineedcoffee.com/alkani-cold-brew-coffee-maker-review-tutorial/) for guidance. ### Summary Even the laziest coffee drinker can still make delicious coffee at home. The brewing methods listed above are easy to use, and only the Alkani Cold Brewer takes up counter space. I put that away between brews.

# The New Culture of Coffee in India [Cafe Culture](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/cafe-culture/)---by [Amit Ahuja](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/amit-ahuja/)![The New Culture of Coffee in India](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/the-new-culture-of-coffee-in-india/india-WA0020.jpg) India has long been a grower of coffee beans – in fact, it is the sixth-largest coffee producer in the world. But in most of the country, most Indians prefer to start their day with tea, and traditionally, if you order coffee in a restaurant, you’re more likely to be served a sad cup of Nescafé than “real coffee.”![Kerala, India](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/Kerala-india.B1ya6fox_FnB8S.webp)_Kerala, India_### The Southern Tradition The exception to this rule are parts of Southern India, namely Tamil Nadu and Karnataka, where coffee has been enjoyed for generations. This is the region where, so the story goes, Baba Budan smuggled in his seven coffee beans from Yemen in the 17th century while returning from a pilgrimage, beginning the cultivation of coffee in India. For many people in these two states, coffee is the drink of choice. Street-side kaapi bars serve up delicious, frothy blends of filter coffee, hot milk, and of course sugar. Kaapi is the name of that Indian filtered coffee. There is a theatrical element to this tradition: “meter coffee” gets its name from the method of combining and frothing the hot drink by pouring it back and forth between one receptacle and another, often at an exaggerated height. But the face of coffee consumption is changing in India. Just as Indian chai (or something like it) has become a staple in cafés in the West under the redundant name “chai tea latte,” European-style cafés are now popping up all over urban India. Not surprisingly, southern cities like Bangalore have embraced this new trend and boast dozens of cafés and eateries where friends can gather and socialize over a cup of coffee. The ambiance varies from squashy-couch comfort to artsy to upscale, depending on your preference and of course your budget. This café culture has introduced coffee to many Indians for the first time, and even in traditional coffee-drinking regions has brought more variety to the drink. Baristas serve up espresso, cappuccino, filter coffee, and latte to people who had far fewer options before.![india-WA0016](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/india-WA0016.DyXLV3ZZ_1R0sTz.webp) ### Re-Importing Our Exports In the past, even the restaurants that served filter coffee tended to import the beans from Europe, resulting in a brew that was anything but fresh. Because coffee was seen as an export crop only, an absurd situation arose in which high-quality Indian beans were sold to European companies such as Illy, who would process them and blend them with other beans. Restaurants and retailers in India would then import such products to serve or sell to their customers. As ground coffee entered the marketplace, some customers had no idea how to brew it and tried to dissolve the grounds in hot water as if they were making instant coffee. These days, entrepreneurs are starting to change all of that. Several coffee house chains, home-grown and foreign, have popped up in cities all over India. Café Coffee Day got the ball rolling in 1996, and there are now over 1500 locations across the entire country. Chains like Barista and Brewberrys were not far behind, and more recently, international chains such as Costa and Starbucks have joined the scene.![india-WA0026](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/india-WA0026.DQ3qrioW_svdCJ.webp)_Private Cafe in Hyderabad_### A New Urban Space Young people were the first to jump on the café bandwagon. For the youth, a coffee house is not only a place to buy lattes and Frappuccinos®, but also a much-needed urban space. A café offers a neutral meeting place that allows friends and colleagues to get together in an appealing space that is neither a home nor a workplace. The older generation has caught up fast with this new trend, and you can often see informal work meetings taking place in cafés. Not surprisingly, tourists are also big fans of cafés that offer them their caffeine fix in a cozy environment complete with Wi-Fi and air conditioning. These days, coffee shops are located in train stations, hospitals, airports, shopping malls, and other public spaces and institutions.![india-mocha](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/india-WA0023.D39NJXev_Z2wm9wU.webp)_Mocha_### New Domestic Markets For farmers, this recent domestic demand for coffee offers hope for expansion and increased profit. Companies such as TheIndianBean.com are buying and roasting Indian coffees, especially for the domestic market, appealing to India’s growing middle class. Their website also educates users about brewing techniques. Starbucks in India also uses 100 percent Indian-grown beans in its espresso-based drinks. In the past ten years, per capita consumption of coffee in India has increased by 40%. Beginning in the 1990s, coffee growers stopped focusing just on maximizing yields and have worked to improve the quality of the beans. Both domestically and abroad, the results speak for themselves. India still exports almost 80 percent of the beans it produces, but local consumption is on the rise. Café chains have also introduced consumers to coffees from around the world. Beans from South and Central America, as well as East Africa, are finding their way into the Indian market as coffee drinkers start to crave more variety. Cold coffee-based sodas and other drinks are now available canned and coffee-flavoured ice cream is becoming more commonplace. Across the board, coffee is becoming a more familiar flavour. But if you’re a tea drinker, don’t worry! It doesn’t seem like India’s favorite drink is going to be displaced any time soon. Per capita, Indians still drink more than 8 times as much tea as coffee. Most of the coffee farmers in the country have never tasted coffee (with the exception of instant) but continue to start their day with a hot cup of tea as their parents and grandparents did before them. Coffee and the café scene are still a bit of an urban, middle-class niche.![india tea](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/india-WA0017.By7lu8Cp_1eUkoo.webp)_Tea_### Old vs. New How does this café culture compare with the traditional coffee bars of the Southern states? The two venues are really quite different: the traditional coffee bars offer standing room only, and the idea is to drink up and make room for the next customer. (Interestingly, traditional Italian coffee bars used a similar model.) With the new style of café, the space is as important a product as the coffee itself and a big reason for the success of these businesses. Cafés are much more expensive than kaapi bars, but for the price, you also get a valuable “living” space where you can meet with friends and colleagues. Perhaps the traditional coffee bars will find a way to adapt their delicious product to this style of venue, offering the best of both worlds. Whether you prefer to sip your traditional kaapi standing at a street café in Karnataka, or take selfies with your friends in a trendy establishment in Mumbai, it seems that coffee culture is here to stay.![coffee shake topped with icecream and chocolate syrup](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/india-WA0020.B3fsVJrn_Z62bJJ.webp)_Coffee shake topped with ice cream and chocolate syrup_### Resources [List of countries by coffee production](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_coffee_production) – Wikipedia [Coffee production in India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffee_production_in_India) – Wikipedia [Coffee Board sees scope to improve per capita consumption](https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/economy/agri-business/coffee-board-sees-scope-to-improve-per-capita-consumption/article20713710.ece1) – Article on the growing coffee consumption in India.

# The Naked Portafilter and Diagnosing Espresso Extraction Problems [Espresso](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/espresso/)---by [Chris Arnold](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/chris-arnold/)![The Naked Portafilter and Diagnosing Espresso Extraction Problems](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/the-naked-portafilter/the-naked-portafilter-2.jpg) You may have been wondering if there are any cool new coffee toys to improve your Barista skills. Oh sure, there are the ubiquitous click tamper thingies, and of course, the ever-so sexy bathroom scale to measure your tamp pressure. One word – BORING! But if you want something that says, “I know Starbucks is evil, now Pimp my Espresso Machine!!!” then read on. There is a relatively new phenomenon among coffee enthusiasts that is not only a great Barista training tool but is also beautiful. It is commonly referred to as a Bottomless Portafilter. Usually, a bottomless portafilter is “chopped”, or cut off, so that the entire bottom is visible and nakedly exposed for the peeping toms in all of us. This also allows the Barista in training to see the bottom of the portafilter basket, since this is where the coffee will start its journey into the little espresso cup. It will allow said Barista to see some other cool (and often beautiful) stuff whilst pulling a shot; more on that later.![Bottomless Portafilter and Standard Portafilter](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/bottomless-portafilter1.i6nMM_Li_Zotxn1.webp)_Bottomless Portafilter & Standard Portafilter_ The Naked Portafilter is a novel concept at first glance. But how can it help the aspiring barista? Well, the holy grail of all baristas is, of course, an espresso shot that not only looks good but tastes good too. The perfect extraction is a black-magic melange of the perfect grind, dose, and tamp. Let’s not even talk about the roasted beans, water temperature, machine pressure, or water pH. We will save your brain cells for another article – GEEK ALERT! Ideally, every particle of the ground espresso should be of the same size, and when compressed or tamped into the portafilter basket, it should likewise have no differences in how tightly or loosely it is compressed from side to side or top to bottom. Although perfection in this regard is impossible, a Crotchless Portafilter can help identify things such as channeling, blonding, and tiger striping, among other things. ### Channeling Channeling is when the water finds its way through cracks or small inconsistencies in the coffee “puck”. This means that the coffee gets an uneven extraction, producing an inferior shot of espresso. Common causes are an uneven tamp, or too much coffee (referred to as overdosing).![Espresso Side Channeling](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/side-channeling1.CkbrHugs_wJNn3.webp)_Espresso with Side Channeling_### Blonding Blonding in the shot can happen when the coffee is being under-extracted, causing an off-taste. Although this is expected near the last part of the shot (and a cue to think about ending the shot), blonding should not occur during the majority of the shot.![Blonding Espresso](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/espresso-blonding-shot1.D9d3uK7g_ZfFxkY.webp)_Blonding espresso shot, among other problems_### Tiger Stripes Tiger Stripes that are uniform are usually a good sign, as long as most of the stripes are medium to dark in color and the pour time is not too quick or slow; most agree a 2-ounce double should run about 22-30 seconds. Always let taste be your ultimate authority.![Tiger Striping](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/tiger-striping1.C11i7xv6_Z1zDpL6.webp)_Decent Tiger Striping. Can you pick out any problems?_ The Bottomless Portafilter can let the Barista see exactly what is happening under the hood. Channeling can be identified by “spurters” and “geysers”. This is where the espresso sprays out in small (or large) jet-like streams at varying angles. ### Multiple Streams Also having multiple smaller streams coming straight down instead of one unified stream can also be a sign of channeling. Assuming your machine is perfectly level, even a unified stream that is off to one side can indicate side-channeling. A perfect extraction will not exhibit any of this behavior. And of course, the perfect-looking shot can tell the Barista that his technique is probably fine. Of course, we all know no matter how good the shot looks, it still has to taste good.![Spurter Espresso with Blonding](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/espresso-spurter-blonding2.p7ersujH_1CqFof.webp)_Spurter Espresso with Blonding_![Espresso Multiple Streams](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/espresso-multiple-streams1.mLLnCLaV_rzjpY.webp)_Espresso with Multiple Streams_### Perfect Shot But when the perfect shot is captured in a photo, it is a beautiful thing – Espresso Porn, as many call it. The coffee drips somewhat slowly, evenly, just like honey, into the demitasse cup. The rich, even color bands are followed down as they converge into that perfectly centered columned stream of goodness. The result in the cup should be a thick and persistent head of “crema”, which is all of the good stuff in the coffee, and none of the bad.![God Shot - Espresso](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/god-shot1.865TExaE_Z2mnJLi.webp)_Outstanding looking espresso shot!_ Since espresso machine makers love to invent their own sizes, shapes, and molecular structures, check with your favorite espresso parts supplier for a Bottomless Portafilter that matches perfectly your machine. Then you can really laugh at those people who _Starbucks_ would label baristas. They should really be called assembly-line automatons. Do they even know what a portafilter is anymore? I don’t think so. ### Resources [Espresso Tamping Visual Tutorial](https://ineedcoffee.com/espresso-tamping/) – Having a good tamp is a major factor in pulling excellent espresso shots.

# The Melitta Manual 6-cup Coffee Maker [Brewing Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/brewing-coffee/)---by [David Kilpatrick](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/david-kilpatrick/)![The Melitta Manual 6-cup Coffee Maker](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/the-melitta-manual-6-cup-coffee-maker/PHOTO11.jpg) Writers need coffee. Since absinthe isn’t around anymore, it is about as good as we can do in terms of stimulating our synapses. But I digress. I’ve been looking for the perfect coffee making system for at least twenty years. I’ve been through at least ten coffee pots of different make and design and found them all to come up short when it comes to brewing the perfect cup. But unlike some of my peers who will accept any kind of awful-tasting dishwater brew, I will not. There’s something about that perfect cuppa joe as you’re firing up the laptop that really gets the creative juices flowing. So, realizing this and realizing that I haven’t put out a new book in a couple of years, I came to the conclusion that my coffee-making has been terribly off for the last couple of years. But I digress again. So the other day, I was in World Market looking for stuff unrelated to coffee when I saw this little jewel:![Melitta Manual 6 cup Coffee Maker](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/PHOTO11.B-td6HjH_1BkRo5.webp)_Melitta Manual 6 cup Coffee Maker_ It’s a Melitta six-cup manual coffee brewing system. Since I had been contemplating a Chemex for quite some time, this thing intrigued me. Basically, it is the same setup: a cone-holding device on top, a carafe on the bottom and you add your own boiling water. Nice. I checked the price: On sale for $9.99. Even at the full price of $11.99, it beat the [Chemex](https://ineedcoffee.com/chemex-coffee-brewing-history-and-tutorial/) by thirty bucks. Based on my research at sites like INEEDCOFFEE and by my own trials, I believe that the major problem with brewing coffee is controlling the temperature of the water. Of course, coffee quality and grind, water quality, etc. are all factors, I’ve taken care of these elements but still have crappy coffee. The problem is the temperature; electric pots either don’t get it right or their internal design ultimately fails and either makes the water too hot or too cold. With this Melitta two-piece design, one boils their own water and can thus have total control over both the temperature of the water and the flow of the water through the coffee. The little extra time it takes to do this is no big deal to me; I found that it only adds a couple of actual minutes to the overall prep time. The Melitta uses #6 cone filters:![#6 Cone Coffee Filters](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/PHOTO2.DfGfCo8l_bnAnt.webp)_#6 Cone Coffee Filters_ Personally, I prefer white filters. I don’t know why, but the coffee seems to be smoother. The argument against white filters is that they are bleached in a process that creates dioxin, the most powerful carcinogen on the planet. Think Agent Orange and Love Canal. However, when faced with the choice between genetic mutations within my body or a good cup of coffee, I choose the coffee. In case you’re wondering why the filter in the photo is “natural,” it is simply because I can’t find the white ones anywhere. A side note: it appears the Chemex fold-type filters will fit in this device. I may try some out and give an update on their performance later on. To use this system, follow the guidelines on this site for the Chemex pot. I boil the water in a conventional teapot:![Kettle on Stove](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/PHOTO3.DchRHnOX_Z1EHj7y.webp)_Kettle on Stove_ A note on teapots: if you can, get one with a spout longer than this one. This short type causes a lot of splatters as the water falls onto the grounds. I hear that the optimum brew temperature is around 208 degrees Fahrenheit. Since it’s boiling at 212 at my current elevation, I simply turn off the gas and swish it around a bit. Here I am “blooming” the coffee by saturating it with water for between 15 and 45 seconds. Note the bubbles as the coffee expands like foam. This is carbon dioxide escaping, which helps the grounds stay submerged in the water instead of floating during the brewing. Now, I don’t know if any of this is true or not, but it is kinda fun to watch the coffee foam up.![Coffee blooming](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/PHOTO3b.1GjrSEY__1WYN9R.webp)_Coffee blooming_ After the blooming, there are two different ways to do the full brew. First, you can just dump all the water in. The remaining grounds at the end will look like this:![Coffee grounds after pour](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/PHOTO4.2aKZ1lNB_s4cE6.webp)_Coffee grounds after the pour_ Note the even distribution along the sides. The coffee is exposed to the water less and there are fewer grounds at the bottom. This makes for a weaker cup of coffee, but a smooth one. It’s also a much faster process; you can dump in the water and finish getting dressed. Or, you can pour the water in slowly, carefully keeping the grounds concentrated near the bottom. Here’s what that looks like afterward:![Coffee grounds after slow pour](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/PHOTO5.BA9iPkjy_2qvt6p.webp)_Coffee grounds after the slow pour_ This makes for a really strong cup of coffee and is my favorite method. Either method is your choice; unlike an electric pot, you can custom tailor your brew in all aspects. As far as the carafe goes, it appears the cone-holder will fit nearly any carafe you can put under it. This would make a replacement of a broken one rather easy, and you shouldn’t have to pay the extorted high price of a proprietary carafe. One could even put this cone-holder on a thermal carafe. The carafe comes with a lid:![Melitta Brewed Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/PHOTO6.CRejF52k_Z1Odcb8.webp)_Melitta Brewed Coffee_ But since I drink my coffee as soon as I brew it, I never use the thing. My own little trick that should not be attempted by anyone sane is to do this:![Quick coffee reheat (NOT ADVISED)](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/PHOTO7.-x_vabam_cuH4Y.webp)_Quick coffee reheat (NOT ADVISED)_ A few-second blast of heat to the carafe bottom helps keep the coffee warm until you’re ready to pour. This carafe is not designed for direct heat, so don’t attempt this at home! And for Pete’s sake, don’t go walking away after turning on the heat; the carafe will explode. The Melitta will only make a couple of American-sized cups of coffee at a time, but I see on their website that they have a 10-cup version, too. Playing with the pouring rate may get you another cup. You can also use #4 filters in it for single-cup brewing. Clean-up is bone-headedly simple. And there’s never any descaling needed; when your teapot gets a few deposits, you can just scrub them off. Oh, and how’s the coffee? Perfect. Of course, you’ll have to experiment a bit just like you must do with all coffee makers. The Melitta system is highly recommended for everyone who is interested in coffee quality and doesn’t mind a few extra minutes to get it. If you’re the type who likes to throw in a pod and hit a button, it isn’t for you.

# The Naturally Caffeine-Free Coffee Plant [Coffee Business](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/coffee-business/)---by [Michael Allen Smith](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/michael-allen-smith/) This weekend, several coffee websites were abuzz about the Coffea charrieriana (or Charrier Coffee), a coffee plant that naturally has no caffeine. This plant made the Top 10 species list by The International Institute For Species Exploration, and rightfully so. **A coffee plant that can produce coffee without caffeine is a breakthrough.** Some people won’t understand the significance of this story. They might scoff that we already have methods for removing the caffeine from coffee beans. Yes, we do, but it comes with a cost. All that additional processing of coffee results in reduced flavor. Every coffee roaster knows this. So, instead of roasting to maximize flavor, the roaster will go darker and strive for more body. This is all fine and dandy if you always prefer darker roasts, but not great if you like tasting all the unique flavors found in the lighter roasts.![High Caffeine Content ](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/comic-high-caffeine.D0rHInLW_1XYBaK.webp)_High Caffeine Content by [Todd Zapoli](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/todd-zapoli/).

# The Local Cafe: Van Gogh Coffeehouse, Seattle [Coffee People](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/coffee-people/)---by [Joseph Robertson](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/joseph-robertson/)![The Local Cafe: Van Gogh Coffeehouse, Seattle](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/the-local-cafe-van-gogh-coffeehouse-seattle/clock.jpg) The door is a little clunky – it’s an unassuming glass/metal door – hanging from the inside is a leather strip with several large jingle bells attached. The all-glass front makes the entire space feel more open, which helps as it is a rather small cafe. So walking in is always the same sensation – a brief clunking thud as I pull the door open followed by clanging jingles of the bells hitting the door, then the warmness of the inside and the rich smell of freshly ground coffee wraps around my head in a wordless greeting. The interior of the cafe is warm all around – the walls are a light yellow or perhaps a warm yellowy white, with dark brown wood covering the bottom 4 feet or so of the walls down to the floor. The ceiling is a darker reddish wood, which contrasts perfectly with everything else – the back wall is also an interesting dark red (perhaps with a tinge of orange) with curiously odd swirling patterns. The ceiling is probably about 10 feet upon walking in, but just a few feet into the room, it cathedrals upwards as the room shotguns towards the back. It’s a relatively small cafe – but it doesn’t feel that way. The walls are adorned with paintings that are reproductions of Van Gogh paintings – appropriate for Van Gogh Coffeehouse. The colors of these paintings are absolutely perfect in combination with the walls, ceiling, floors, etc. The crowning piece is the artwork hanging above the counter in the back, featuring the silhouettes of two like coffee souls on elegant balconies looking towards each other with the city of Seattle in the background, framed by a rich orange sunset. The front of the cafe space is all tables, with four very comfortable leather chairs sitting around an electric fireplace – complete with mantel and usual mantel adornments. During the holidays, there is typically something holiday-themed around the mantel. The rest of the year one can find a stack of books on Van Gogh – perfect. I love a cafe that embraces itself in this way. Even the light switch in the bathroom is painted to look like Starry Night – along with old decorative bottles displaying different Van Gogh artwork.![Van Gogh Coffeehouse](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/coffeehouse1.b6nylLrM_1HMOiS.webp) So when you walk in, there are tables to the right and left – I always come here to do some work. There’s a certain element to the atmosphere of this place – it is nice to be around other people, yet it doesn’t get so loud as to be distracting, in fact, it is very easy to completely sink myself into a comfortable focus – even with conversations going on around me. The music is usually subdued, which is nice. So when I walk in, I pick a table, set my bag down, and go get a cup of coffee. Now I don’t know about you, but I got into coffee through the mocha/latte route. In fact, I think my first attempt to embrace “coffee” was through those bottled Starbucks Frappuccinos – you know, the ones that are more like just getting chocolate milk rather than an actual cup of coffee. But a gateway is a gateway. I actually went through college entirely never drinking coffee – thinking I hated it. I always drank tea (I still have a love of well-crafted tea in much the same way as I now love well-crafted coffee). It was after college, during my foray into the 9-5 business world, that I really developed an interest in coffee – though it was more about the escape I got out of it rather than the drink itself. At one point, I realized I was spending a ludicrously large amount of money on lattes at Starbucks and used that as an excuse to try straight-up drip coffee. In retrospect, Starbucks drip is not the best place in the world to try to develop an interest in the actual flavors of coffee and drinking coffee by itself – but that is for another article. The point is that I did become interested in different flavors of coffee by drinking straight-up black coffee – usually with cinnamon (I also had dietary reasons for not adding anything else to it). The little sidebar is there to frame my simple but undeniable attraction to Van Gogh Coffeehouse – I walk in, I pick a table, I put my bag down and I go get a cup of coffee. One of the best things about this cafe is the baristas – they love what they do, they always greet you with a smile, they remember who you are, they have great conversation, and they make some darn good coffee. Any number of elements in a local cafe can make or break the experience – but the two with the biggest impact for me are the baristas and the quality of the coffee (having visited so many cafes in Seattle and participated in the market, I’ve grown a tasteful knowledge of what coffee can taste like, and that has made me a bit more picky about what I drink).![Cafe](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/full-cafe.B1Nh1JBj_1J9Gd2.webp) I tend to get the same mug each time – one of the neat things about independent coffeehouses is that they tend to have their own unique style of cups. Since I always go to Van Gogh to do some work, I never get coffee in a paper cup. Their mugs, though, are on the smaller size – very sturdy, well-made hot coffee mugs – but narrower than the typical mug I’m used to anywhere else. They almost have a handcrafted feel to them, very smooth but with curious molding to the handle like it was shaped by a craftsman’s hands – or maybe I just like to imagine things. They hold just enough coffee for me to enjoy a hot cup over a 10-15 minute period without it getting unpalatably lukewarm. They have mugs in 4 different colors – mostly red and green, though they just got several new small mugs in yellow and one blue mug. I always get that blue mug if it’s available – I don’t know why but the blue mug feels right. Now, one thing about Van Gogh’s coffee is that they serve it in a way that is somewhat counterintuitive to great coffee flavor. Typically, if you want the best flavor experience and the smoothest coffee with the least amount of bitterness, then you will brew fresh by the cup so that the coffee beans spend as little time as possible, from being roasted to being put in your cup. One of my favorite cafes (which will make an appearance in next month’s issue) is very adept at this – they get freshly roasted beans, grind them to order, and prepare a cup via Aeropress (a single serving vessel that produces an amazingly smooth cup of coffee that showcases the flavor of the beans in extraordinary fashion). Van Gogh does not do this – they prepare coffee in standard drip fashion and sit it out in air pots – the trick, they say, is to brew at a much lower temperature than you may think (ie, boiling water ruins the flavor as you burn your grounds). They brew with Zoka Coffee Roasters beans.![ghost cafe](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/ghost-cafe.UsjLi711_1mIdbh.webp)![Kids menu](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/kids-menu.Dp-Jk53e_ZIc8Wp.webp) They are very good about a few details, though. Number one is that they do as much as they can to make sure the coffee in the pots is fresh – so they don’t typically brew several pots and let them sit around all day. They provide three different kinds of coffee – and as an extra, which I really love, they provide flavor details for each kind so you can both know exactly what you are getting and explore the flavor of your cup with those details in mind. For example, they always have Decaf, which is described as [smooth, sweet, nutty], and a House Brew, which is described as [smokey, dark chocolate, sweet]. The third is a rotating premium coffee – today it is a Medium coffee from Nicaragua which is described as [Almond, Butter, Lemongrass]. Typically my experience with drip in cafes (Starbucks included) is that the flavor gets superseded by a watered-down taste, as well as typically an overly bitter sense and often the flavor of burned coffee. One of the ways to avoid this is using high-quality beans – which Van Gogh does – but they are also quite skilled at bringing out the flavors in these coffees through proper handling of grounds and water temperature.![clock](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/clock.CpB3-BuF_Z4tIuQ.webp) So I’ll walk in, pick my table, sit down, and get my cup of coffee. Then I go back to my table, have a seat, and have a moment for myself. Their tables are very unique – they used to be rather mediocre/ugly-looking tables that had a tablecloth topped by a sheet of what I assume was Plexiglas. A few months ago, they replaced them with these beautiful-looking dark wood tables. They have a very smooth finish, but if you run the palms of your hands over the surface, you can still feel the ridges in the wood. So I’ll sit there, pause for a moment, then take the first sip of my coffee. Now perhaps I am a bit different in my coffee drinking habits, but I’ve grown to enjoy the experience of trying to discover the flavors in my coffee. I start off by simply enjoying the aroma, then the first sip I let sit on my tongue and let it travel around my mouth for a few moments – ah…there’s the (Lemongrass)..and there’s the (Butter)…no bitterness. If you recall from earlier, I don’t put anything in my coffee (except sometimes cinnamon, but not as much these days). Part of the experience of the cafe is the coffee itself, and I like to experience it fully unhindered by other elements.![breakfast](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/menu.DNtUJt-g_Z14egnX.webp)![cafe menu](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/menu2.DQbmPCxR_Nem8Q.webp) That isn’t to say that I don’t enjoy a latte or mocha from time to time – in fact, I think the lattes that the baristas at Van Gogh make are delicious – but when I go in on a typical day I have a desire to just sink myself into the coffee, experience the flavor, think about where it came from and then let that inspire me. I remember when I first really got into coffee through Starbucks. One of the things that Starbucks does really well is making it clear what you are going to get – you know the experience that you are going to have. That’s one of the things that made getting into the drip coffee easier. Starbucks had such great descriptions of their different coffees – though not in the sense that they explained the different flavors to expect – I just remember enjoying the way that they label and display their coffee. Ultimately, coffee is far more an experience than a product. I think this is what kept me from visiting local cafes for such a long time. I know that after I got into coffee, I always thought to myself – I should check out some of the local cafes and roasters – it is Seattle, after all. But I always sidled back to what was familiar – to the experience that I could understand and anticipate. It can be intimidating to step from the world of what you know, the world that you don’t. When I first started visiting the different independent cafes around the city, I would often have absolutely no clue what I wanted when I entered – and this I think often keeps a lot of people away from exploring these different experiences. It certainly doesn’t help if the barista gets frustrated at your lack of knowledge in what you desire – after all, it’s hard to desire what you don’t fully understand, and the world of coffee is far greater than that which is presented in a place like Starbucks.![van-gogh](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/van-gogh.gFBX3p8w_7pT68.webp) It wasn’t until I met a particularly enthusiastic barista at one of my other favorite cafes. I recall going in, and he asked, “What would you like?’ and my answer was, “I have absolutely no idea! some coffee!’ He took the time to teach me several different things about coffee (the effect of water temperature, ground size, brew method, etc., and from that point on, I have been exploring deeper and deeper experiences. So the next chance you get to check out that local cafe – just realize that there are a whole host of experiences to have and that you should embrace whatever uncertainty may be preventing you from finding those experiences. I hope to continue sharing my own experiences of different cafes around here – simply so that I can show you the complete uniqueness that each of them presents, and how truly inspiring they can be._This article is courtesy of Extracted Magazine._### Resources [Van Gogh Coffeehouse](http://vangoghcoffeehouse.com/) – 8210 35th Ave NE, Seattle [Vincent van Gogh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vincent_van_Gogh) – Wikipedia page.

# The Mighty Bean Gets Ground Down [Grinding Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/grinding-coffee/)---by [Barbara Stec](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/barbara-stec/)![The Mighty Bean Gets Ground Down](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/the-mighty-bean-gets-ground-down/coffee-cattle5001.jpg) The next time you pass by your neighborhood coffee shop, try to remember that it wasn’t always this easy to get a great cup of “java.” Coffee was probably first discovered in Yemen, Somalia, or Ethiopia about 1000 years ago. With a flavor blending chocolate and charcoal flavors, along with an undeniable caffeinated kick, over the centuries, it has developed into the world’s most popular hot drink. If you’re ready to take on the challenge of preparing the world’s best cup of coffee for your friends and family, you’ll need good equipment and some deep background on the mighty bean. Coffee plants are shrubs or small trees that thrive only in tropical or subtropical climates. There are more than 90 species of the coffee genus of plants, called Coffea. In East Africa, especially Ethiopia, coffee grows wild in its native habitat. Even today, during the spring, the shepherds of the local tribes usually take their animals, whether goats or sheep, into the uplands where the coffee plants are in full fruit. The fruit of the plant is called a cherry in the coffee industry, and the cherries of many coffee trees are bright red or purple, making them an attractive temptation for both man and beast. But men are very cautious about tasting new foods, and the goats of Ethiopia are probably the first living things to enjoy the caffeine rush of the coffee plant. The shepherds almost certainly took notice of their charges gamboling and frolicking around after eating a bunch of the cherries. Since the animals didn’t die, later on, a decision was made to test the strange new fruit. The results must have been interesting to watch because the flesh of raw cherries is bitter, and under the flesh is a layer of slime called mucilage, coating the seeds. However, the seed in the center, which we call the coffee bean, definitely seemed to have something worth looking into. It must have taken a few years for the villagers of the African hills to arrive at the best formula for making coffee, but they developed the method that we still use today, essentially unchanged: First, remove all of the flesh and mucilage from the bean. Secondly, roast the beans. Thirdly, grind the coffee seeds into crumbs or powder. Then, pour hot water through the grounds, catching the brew while discarding the soaked, depleted, ground-up beans. And there is your basic cup of coffee.![Cattle approach the Coffee plant](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/coffee-cattle5001.Bs6oqeFk_JkSLm.webp)_Cattle approach the Coffee plant_ Today, coffee lovers can select an incredible variety of coffee beans harvested from around the world, some with more or less body, more or less acidity, and some with no caffeine! If you would like to do your own roasting, you’ll find that uncooked coffee beans, called green coffee, are fairly easy to purchase online. Several coffee fanatic websites eagerly describe how some home roasters have successfully used popcorn poppers to roast their bean to a perfect, toasty brown. For now, the majority of coffee drinkers are content to purchase whole beans and enjoy the immediacy of freshly ground coffee. If you are interested in roasting your own green coffee, you will have to decide if you will be cooking large or small batches of beans, and purchase your roasters appropriately. The simplest method for making great coffee most widely available in the United States is to purchase whole beans roasted locally and then grind and brew them at home. Avoid commercially roasted beans from large retailers. The shelf life of whole beans is not more than six months, and large retailers frequently provide supermarkets and other mass suppliers with enough packages to last beyond this date. After you buy your freshly roasted whole beans, the next step is to purchase a coffee grinder that best suits your needs. In the United States, simple coffee is still the most popular beverage made from the bean, whereas in Southern Europe, espresso can often dominate the kitchen. Coffee beans must be ground up in very different ways to prepare the two drinks. Espresso requires grounds that are almost powdery, while the average automatic brewer requires much less of what is called, the “fineness of the grind.” Most modern coffee grinders offer settings that allow you to adjust the fineness of the grind by tiny degrees. Less expensive grinders offer settings such as Espresso, French Press, and Standard Drip. If you plan to have any variety of brewing in your kitchen, avoid the grinders that offer only one setting, regardless of the price. Coffee grinders use two methods for tearing up the coffee beans. One employs whirling blades, and the other uses what is called a “burr mill.” When blades are used by a grinder, they usually operate at very high speeds. The speed produces a lot of heat, and the heat can definitely alter the chemical composition of the beans and thus the flavor of the brew. These changes of flavor due to heating may be too slight for many consumers to notice, and the blades definitely offer the satisfaction of very quickly providing plenty of grounds with a precise degree of fineness. If you need to make coffee quickly, then blades are perhaps the better choice. Given the luxury of time, both to measure the beans out and savor their flavor, the burr mill coffee grinder is almost always the better choice. Both types of grinders can be purchased with automatic levers to measure out doses for various amounts of espresso or coarse grounds.![2 coffee grinders](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/grinders375.liWa9_WL_ZjDMUC.webp)_Two coffee grinders_ We can of course always have coffee brewed for us at the innumerable and delightful cafes that now dot the United States from sea to sea. What a pleasure it has been for travelers familiar with European cafe society to see the world of espresso, mocha, and cappuccino so thoroughly embraced by this country. Is there any better way to extend a night of revelry than to enjoy an hour of talk over an espresso at midnight? Still, the pleasure of a simple homemade cup of good beans freshly ground can give every morning a sense of style and grace. To create this quality in your kitchen, however, you must decide what kind of coffee you want to make, and then purchase the right equipment for the job. ### References [en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffee) thenibble.com (offline February 2018) Published on February 13, 2010--- #### Barbara Stec

# The Home Roaster Color Chart [Roasting Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/roasting-coffee/)---by [Michael Allen Smith](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/michael-allen-smith/)![The Home Roaster Color Chart](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/the-home-roaster-color-chart/coffee-roast-level-3.jpg)_This article was first published in July 2000 and was updated with new text and photos in August 2011._ Professional coffee roasters often use a color chart by the _Speciality Coffee Association of America (S.C.A.A.)_ to define their roast color levels. The “SCAA/Agtron Roast Color Classification System” chart includes high-resolution color tiles. The kit runs for $290 and can be purchased on their website. Most home roasters have better things to spend their money on, namely more coffee beans. But, like professional roasters, they also need to be able to articulate roast color levels to other roasters or for their roasting logs. In the article [Coffee Roasts: Notes from a Non-Roaster](https://ineedcoffee.com/coffee-roasts-notes-from-a-non-roaster/), we learned using common terms can be problematic. What is dark to one person may be medium to another. What we need is a common color language that we can speak. And that is the motivation for this page. It is to help home coffee roasters and coffee drinkers communicate roast-level preferences based on photos. ### Shortcomings Viewing distinct roast colors is not ideal for a computer monitor. Our monitors may differ in the number of colors viewable, and, likely, our brightness levels vary. So, the photos in the roast below may look slightly different from screen to screen. When this article was first published way back in 2000, the variations were much greater. It should be less of an issue in 2011. With that said, below is a _budget_ coffee roast color chart. This is not a replacement for the SCAA Agtron chart. The SCAA chart is much more specific, and there are far more than eight different roast colors. ### Practical Uses - Home roasting logs or journals. It is important for duplicating blends. - When roasting for someone else. (Example: “Dad told me he likes his coffee roasted to Level 4.”) - Combining color information with time to detect faulty roasting equipment. (Example: It took 8 minutes to hit Level 2 using a ….) ### The Home Roaster Color Chart**Level 1**![coffee-roast-level-1](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/coffee-roast-level-1.DKQ2gh8v_Nnnck.webp)**Level 2**![coffee-roast-level-2](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/coffee-roast-level-2.CdRtoI4J_ZCUzqN.webp)**Level 3**![coffee-roast-level-3](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/coffee-roast-level-3.CH6x-NVt_Z1OVdqT.webp)**Level 4**![coffee-roast-level-4](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/coffee-roast-level-4.iEvf5lFd_1EY6n4.webp)**Level 5**![coffee-roast-level-5](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/coffee-roast-level-5.CyZ23sBT_9lL12.webp)**Level 6**![coffee-roast-level-6](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/coffee-roast-level-6.B0slDeE6_Zkpabk.webp)**Level 7**![coffee-roast-level-7](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/coffee-roast-level-7.DEkFOSV4_1ur9mp.webp)**Level 8**![coffee-roast-level-8](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/coffee-roast-level-81.Cpy3g7t0_Z1au7uD.webp) ### Personal Preferences When I first began home roasting in 1998, I pretty much roasted everything to Level 7, and if I wasn’t paying attention, it went to Level 8. Over the years, my tastes have changed, and these days, I favor roasts between Level 4 and Level 5. You can also vary the Level based on the bean region or brewing method. Take notes and experiment. ### References [Roasting Coffee in a Popcorn Popper](https://ineedcoffee.com/roasting-coffee-in-a-popcorn-popper/) – Tutorial on home roasting coffee using a popcorn popper.

# The Quest for Good Coffee in the Office [Cafe Culture](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/cafe-culture/)---by [Michael Allen Smith](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/michael-allen-smith/)![The Quest for Good Coffee in the Office](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/the-quest-for-good-coffee-in-the-office/office-space-coffee1.jpg) Remember your first day of school? It may have been quite an emotional event to be separated from your parents and surrounded by strangers for hours. This situation is very similar to the college student spoiled on quality coffee heading into his/her first office job. In college, a student is greeted by espresso carts throughout his/her campus experience. Now, this same student must leave the comfort of perfectly made lattes at the student union and join the working world. The office environment will not be as kind as college. That student will come face to face with the office coffee pot and the gross sludge that has been sitting in there for hours. We learned how to get along at school without our moms and dads. Should we learn how to stay awake at the office without quality coffee? No! ### Don’t Succumb to Bad Coffee You may say, “I need coffee to stay awake at this boring job; therefore, I must drink the break room swill.” Not so fast. I’ve dedicated my working career to discovering new and innovative ways to drink quality coffee in the office environment. Before I chronicle my journey of drinking quality coffee at work, let me first discourage you from drinking office swill. Breakroom coffee is typically cheap and low quality. Even if it has some fancy gourmet label, you may be drinking an “office-grade” version of that brand. The coffee may be old. It may be very old. A good scotch improves with age. Coffee doesn’t.![office space coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/office-space-coffee1.CIzlzAst_jSQqj.webp)_Office coffee doesn’t need to be bad._ (Image credit: Office Space (1999) Suppose the quality issue has been researched, and your company takes pride in its coffee purchase. The next question is, “Who made the coffee and when?”. Unless you made the coffee yourself, somebody else could muck it up. You’ve been to meetings with incompetent co-workers. Do you trust them to make your coffee correctly? I didn’t think so. Unless you want to stalk the break room waiting for an opportunity to make coffee for everyone else, you risk getting poorly made or old coffee. ### The Journey Part 1 My first office job was with an IBM company. There was no risk of me drinking bad coffee since there wasn’t a break room near my desk. They had a really strict policy against bringing in electrical appliances, but I had a stronger craving for espresso. Early one morning I snuck my countertop espresso machine to my office. Since I couldn’t place it on my desk, I placed it inside the bottom desk drawer. From there I pulled the cord through the back of the desk and plugged it in. **I had an operational espresso machine running from the bottom drawer of my desk**. The perfect coffee crime. For several months, I made espresso from inside my desk. A few co-workers would slide by my desk with a cup of iced milk, and I would **quietly upgrade them to an iced latte**. Many people walked around the office smelling coffee, but only a select few members of the espresso club knew the secret. ### The Journey Part 2 After I left IBM and started working for Nielsen Media Research, there was no need for clandestine coffee. Nielsen was way more laid back. It was here that I set up a drip machine on my desk and started a coffee club. Every morning at 9 am and afternoon at 1 pm, I would brew up some quality coffee from a local roaster or one of my [home roast](https://ineedcoffee.com/roast-your-own-coffee/) creations. Although I didn’t charge for coffee, a 50-cent donation to cover the cost of the beans was accepted. Of course, those that didn’t donate didn’t get invited back into the coffee club. After a month or so, I had employees waiting in line as the coffee brewed. In fact, there was so much interest in my coffee that the club had a waiting list. As soon as one member didn’t show up at the moment it was brewed, that person was replaced by another. Running your own coffee club works if it doesn’t require too much effort to administer the club. When I left Nielsen, I donated my old drip pot to my former co-workers. The coffee club still operates out of my old cubicle. ### The Journey Part 3 The third and final part of my coffee journey is the [French press](https://ineedcoffee.com/press-pot-tutorial/). With a French press, I don’t need to run a coffee club or operate electrical appliances at my desk. The only thing I need for the French press is hot water. Other employees use the hot water dispenser to make hot tea, and it works fine. Now, I can make a single mug of coffee whenever I want using my own beans. If you have a hot water dispenser, I highly encourage you to buy a French press for your desk and bring in your own supply of coffee every morning.![french press](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/tall-french-press-pot.CZGpMe9o_Z1yRbPz.webp)_Part 3 of the Office Coffee Journey was the French Press._### Conclusion Just because you sold your soul to work for a company that doesn’t love coffee as much as you do, there is no reason to deny yourself good coffee in the workplace. Skip the break room sludge and take it upon yourself to bring in good coffee. What method you choose to brew is up to you and the surroundings. If you conclude there is no way to brew good coffee at your workplace, perhaps you should consider working for another employer. ### Resources [Troubleshooting French Press Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/troubleshooting-french-press-coffee/) – How to make better French press coffee.

# The Sound of Espresso, Music to My Ears [Espresso](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/espresso/)---by [Stefanie Spencer](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/stefanie-spencer/)![The Sound of Espresso, Music to My Ears](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/the-sound-of-espresso-music-to-my-ears/portafilter-tamper5001.jpg) Many times at coffee shops it is difficult to see behind the counter, to see what the barista is really doing. The grinding, banging, pounding, clanking, humming, gurgling, and whistling makes everyone wonder, what is going on back there? While I am making drinks there are usually people peeking around, intently watching with a puzzled stare. So let me show you what is going on, and the next time you are at a coffee shop with a friend, maybe one wondering about all of that noise, you can easily tell them all about it! The first noise in the process is of grinding the beans. For espresso, the grounds need to be very fine, which requires a burr grinder to obtain the correct size and consistency. A burr grinder crushes the beans between two cast metal plates that are set at a certain distance apart, so only once the grounds reach the appropriate size will they be able to fall out of the side of the burrs. After the beans are ground, approximately 14 to 21 grams are measured into the portafilter and then pressed down with a tamper. This is where it seems every barista has his or her own style. It starts with a snap, snap, snap sound as the grounds are transferred from the grinder into the portafilter. Then there might be a thud if they bang the portafilter on the counter to settle the grounds, maybe another snap if they add more coffee, a whack if they tap the side of the portafilter with the tamper, and then the quiet part of pressing the grounds down. Because an espresso machine brews under 8-10 bars of pressure, the grounds need to be pressed down with about 30 pounds of pressure so that the water goes through the grounds evenly for the best extraction.![Espresso: portafilter and tamper](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/portafilter-tamper5001.xdrmfdkv_Z1ynBPj.webp)_Espresso: portafilter and tamper_ Depending on the barista, you might hear some grunting as they muster up the strength for the 30 to 40 pounds of pressure. Next, there might be some clanking as the portafilter is locked into place under the brew group head. This is where the water from the brewing boiler goes through a few screens to disperse it and then goes into and through the grounds in the portafilter. The espresso then flows out of the bottom, divided into two streams, into the cups. If this is for a hot drink, the noise is not over yet. For a latte, breve, cappuccino, or similar drink, the next part is to steam, or froth, the milk with the steam wand. After the milk or half-and-half is poured into the stainless steaming pitcher and set aside, the steam wand is wiped down with a damp rag and then turned on briefly until the water is flushed out. This is where the hissing and whistling begin. The steam wand is submerged in the milk and then the steam is turned on; there might be some gurgling noises too as air is incorporated into the milk. As it swirls around and heats up the steam wand might whistle at a higher pitch until it is finally turned off. The milk is gently poured into the espresso, and the drink is finished.![Espresso machine anatomy](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/espresso-machine500.Da3UVGaT_1SDQ6J.webp)_Espresso machine anatomy_ The next and best sound should be “Mmmmmmm.” Published on December 15, 2009--- #### Stefanie Spencer Stefanie writes for the Voice in the Desert newspaper, a local paper serving Cochise County, Arizona.

# The Perfect Solution For Cold Brew Coffee on the Go [Brewing Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/brewing-coffee/)---by [Michael Allen Smith](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/michael-allen-smith/)![The Perfect Solution For Cold Brew Coffee on the Go](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/the-perfect-solution-for-cold-brew-coffee-on-the-go/cold-brew-coffee-on-the-go.jpg) In addition to their [regular cold brewer](https://ineedcoffee.com/making-cold-brew-coffee-with-the-primula-coffee-maker/), Primula also makes a Travel Bottle Cold Brew Coffee Maker. I really like this brewer. The travel version is different than the regular version in a few ways. Besides brewing less coffee, the coffee it makes is not a concentrate, meaning it is ready to drink as soon as the brew completes. Also, the travel bottle does everything. You brew, store, and drink coffee from it. In this tutorial, we will make cold brew coffee with the Primula Travel Bottle Cold Brew Coffee Maker.![cold-brew-travel](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/cold-brew-travel-503x650.PsrqcMLH_yQDye.webp) ### The Setup There are five parts to the Primula Travel Bottle Cold Brew Coffee Maker. 1. Neoprene cover to protect and insulate the glass. 2. The top lid for the glass brewer. 3. The glass carafe/brewer. 4. The permanent coffee filter. 5. The bottom lid of the glass carafe holds the coffee filter in place.![cold-brewer-setup](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/cold-brewer-setup-643x650.BtjsvqJe_m4DxN.webp) ### #1 Grind Coffee Add enough medium-ground coffee to fill the filter 3/4 of the way full. We are using a medium drip grind here because we are using less coffee per ounce of water and aren’t making a concentrate.![cold-brew-add-coffee-filter](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/cold-brew-add-coffee-filter-650x458.CeyOAmzz_1DP6aq.webp) ### #2 Add the Coffee to the Filter and Secure it to the Bottom Lid Turn the brewer upside down and open the bottom lid. Before placing the filter in the brewer, make sure there are no loose grounds on the rim of the filter. You want a tight seal that does not leak. Place the coffee filter inside. It should look just like the photo below. Secure the bottom lid. This will lock the filter in place for the next step, which involves flipping the travel bottle and filling it with water.![cold-brew-place-filter](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/cold-brew-place-filter-502x650.k4FnXe1U_Z2o4MKw.webp) ### #3 Fill the Travel Brewer with Water Ensure the bottom lid is securely fastened and then fill the travel brewer with cold water. Once full, secure the top lid. At this point, you can gently rock the brewer to ensure water is saturating all the ground coffee.![cold-brew-begin-brewing](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/cold-brew-begin-brewing-439x650.BxcCUqxG_ZKQdB.webp) ### #4 Brew For 12 Hours (probably longer) Place the brewer in the refrigerator or countertop for at least 12 hours. If it is too weak, you can extend the brew time another 6-12 hours. Do a quick taste test before proceeding to the next step. My best results have been from doing a 24-hour brew and periodically doing a gentle rocking motion during the brewing. If it is still too weak for your liking, don’t fill the bottle completely full of water. If it ends up being too strong, just add the water back!![cold-brew-brewing](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/cold-brew-brewing-479x650.CaI6GFld_1uNm1.webp) ### #5 Remove Coffee Filter Ensure the top lid is secure, then flip the brewer upside down. Open the bottom filter and remove the coffee filter. Once the coffee filter is removed, you may see some loose coffee grounds around the edge of the bottle. Take a paper towel and wipe them off. Once the rim is clean, secure the bottom lid. Place the brewer inside the insulated cover.![cold-brew-finished](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/cold-brew-finished-513x650.BRahMmgo_Z1cS17W.webp) ### #6 Finished The coffee is finished. There is no need to add water, as this is not a concentrate. You can pour it into a glass or drink it from the bottle. Cold brew coffee doesn’t get much easier than this. ### Troubleshooting Two things can go wrong with cold brew: either the coffee is too strong or too weak. Since this doesn’t brew a concentrate, it will unlikely be too strong. But if it is, the answer is to add water to the finished brew simply. If you discover that the coffee is too weak, you can try a few strategies. You can extend the brew time, grind a little finer, or gently rock the brewer a few times during the brewing process. If you rock the brewer, wipe the lid clean before securing the bottom lid. ### No More Leaks A few Amazon reviews complain that the bottom lid leaks. The first brewer I received for this tutorial did have an occasional leak issue. Usually, it resulted from loose grounds between the lip of the filter and the bottom lid. The same thing can happen with the [Aeropress](https://ineedcoffee.com/upside-aeropress-coffee-brewing-tutorial/). The good news is the filter has been redesigned. It is larger and it solves the leak problem. If you are looking for a simple no-mess foolproof cold coffee brewer, give the Primula Brew Travel Bottle a try. ### Resources [Making Cold Brew Coffee With the Primula Coffee Maker](https://ineedcoffee.com/making-cold-brew-coffee-with-the-primula-coffee-maker/) – INeedCoffee tutorial for the 1.6-quart cold coffee brewer.

# The Quick Economics of Home Roasting Coffee [Roasting Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/roasting-coffee/)---by [Michael Allen Smith](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/michael-allen-smith/) What does the coffee fanatic do during a recession? On the surface, there appear to be four choices. 1. Do nothing differently. Cut spending elsewhere. _Let the dog eat generic chow while you are sipping on your Cup of Excellence coffee._2. Cut back on the QUANTITY of coffee. _Have one less coffee a day._3. Cut back on the QUALITY of coffee. _Goodbye local roaster, hello canned coffee._4. Start roasting your own coffee. _Brilliant idea!_ Option 1 is the first line of defense. But what if you’ve already cut back your expenses in other areas? Option 2 is the most efficient method but requires the most discipline. Option 3 is just wrong. Never sacrifice quality. That leaves us with Option 4. Let me review the numbers and show you how much money you could save by home-roasting your coffee. Before I go through the numbers, I must say that home-roasting coffee is super easy, and many businesses sell green coffee beans. For help on getting started with home roasting, look over the [Roasting Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/roasting-coffee/) section. It has many tutorials and articles to get you started.![Green Coffee Beans](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/green-coffee-beans-economics1.7Is0k-6V_Z20UIVJ.webp)_Green Coffee Beans_ Now for the economics. On the Internet, many different varietals of unroasted green coffee can be purchased for $5-$7 a pound. Note that this is not a wholesale price but a way individuals can buy sizes of one to five pounds. For this example, I will use $6 as my one-pound price. Island and award-winning coffees will cost more. Some beans will be less. Buying larger sizes at one time will also reduce your costs and sometimes your shipping expenses. When a pound of coffee is roasted, it will lose 15-20% of its weight. This means a pound of unroasted coffee does not equal a pound of roasted coffee. For this example, I will use 17.5% weight loss. The next expense to consider is the cost and expected life of the roaster. Home coffee roasters are not immortal. Home coffee roasters range in price from a $2 oven tray to over $1,000. I’ve roasted coffee using many different methods, and even though roasters are built much better today, I still allow for a 50-cent per pound depreciation on the roaster. Some roasters are tanks and will last much longer. Some are duds and will have a shorter life. Other home roasters have disagreed with my 50-cent number as being too much. I’d rather err on the conservative side. The takeaway point is that a home coffee roaster has a finite lifespan. Green Coffee Price per lb $6.00 Weight Loss 17.5% Roasted Price per lb $7.19 Roaster Depreciation per lb $0.50 True Coffee Price per lb $7.69_* I did not calculate electricity because the fuel cost of getting to and from a coffeehouse for most people will be more significant._ In the home roasting example above, coffee costs 48 cents per ounce. Here in Seattle, I would estimate the price of roasted coffee is double that. **If a family consumed 1 lb of coffee per week, home-roasting their own coffee would save about $400 a year.**![Lyman Kona Extra Fancy Green Coffee Beans](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/kona-green-coffee-beans.-hoxVJ2b_24oOP8.webp)_Lyman Kona Extra Fancy Green Coffee Beans_ Some places sell green beans for less than $6 a pound if money is tight. You can find beans in the $4-$5 price range. There are also green bean cooperatives that pool the resources of many home roasters so they can buy beans at even lower wholesale prices. From the interview [Meeting Up With The Green Coffee Buying Club](https://ineedcoffee.com/meeting-up-with-the-green-coffee-buying-club/): > _So a typical nice Ethiopian Harrar for example might come in at $2.50/lb. So on 15 lbs, the coffee is $37.50, shipping is about $10, and the “PayPal, insurance, & packaging fees” are about another $10. So $37.50 + $10 + $10 = $57.50/15 lbs = $3.83/lb, or about $4/lb in round numbers._ Should you roast your coffee? That depends on what your time is worth, how much coffee you drink, how tight your budget is, and if it sounds like a fun hobby. Also, roasting coffee for friends makes an excellent and memorable gift. Unlike that $15 bottle of wine, they will be eager to consume your home-roasted coffee the next day.

# The Perfect Latte [Cafe Culture](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/cafe-culture/)---by [Michael J Vaughn](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/michael-j-vaughn/)![The Perfect Latte](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/the-perfect-latte/perfect-latte1.jpg) Andre plays classical guitar at the How You Bean, a coffeehouse in Boulder, Colorado. He plays for tips, but really he plays for Roxanne, Queen of Lattes, who works behind the counter. It takes him a while to notice her. Andre is drawn to a well-defined type, olive-skinned girls with robust features and dark eyes. He spent his high school years with Maria Frenghetti, an exuberant Catholic beauty who chose graduation day to sacrifice their love on the pyres of religion and family. His first night at the Bean, Roxanne barely registers. She is slim, red-haired, freckled, a quick entry to his Not-My-Type file (he does not do this consciously, but his filters are ruthlessly consistent). He plays for two hours, to small applause but several smiles, plus sixteen dollars in his guitar case.![Perfect Latte by INeedCoffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/perfect-latte1.Nikmn06O_ZMvMf2.webp)_Perfect Latte by INeedCoffee_ “Say, Andre?” It’s the tall, red-haired barista. “Did you want your drink? You get a free drink.” “Oh. Sure. How ’bout a double latte? I’ll pick it up after this last song.” He plays an arrangement of “Purple Haze” by Jimi Hendrix. It’s a remarkable rendition, because it’s done to a steady baroque pulse, and you have to really pay attention to catch the tune. Andre savors the raised eyebrows and chuckles of recognition as they make their way around the room. He receives his first applause. An aging hippie yells, “Rock on!” Five more dollars migrate to the guitar case. “That was great!” says the barista. “I’ll leave your drink on the table.” “Thanks.” He gathers his tips, lowers his guitar into the case, then turns to find the most perfect latte he has ever seen. It sits in a tall, narrow glass, like a clear two-inch pipe with a handle. The bottom layer is four inches of steamed milk; the middle an inch-wide stripe of espresso the color of charred wood. The top is two inches of milk foam, edging past the brim like a snow bank, one feathered dollop flipped over like a pompadour. Only once has Andre seen such a thing – a caffe in Florence, on a tour of Italy after his first year in college. A woman who could be Maria Frenghetti’s mother laughs when he sips at the foam. “No!” she says. “Presto!” He’s not good with Italian, but he does know musical notation – and “presto” is “quickly.” So he swallows. The espresso bites into his tongue, then slips away in a wash of hot milk and foam. It’s like rough sex. In his mouth. He has trouble expressing this to his friends. He has more trouble explaining this to the baristas of America, where efficiency has buried all other considerations. He refers to it by one filthy word: sploosh. Everything dumped in at once – a warmish, beige beverage. He tries to explain the Italian method with adjectives: “parfait,” “stripes,” “separated.” He turns to ad-hoc lessons: _Now pour the espresso down the back of the spoon, so it goes through the foam, but not into the milk._ But life gets busy, and you shouldn’t have to give five minutes of instructions every time you want a latte. So he gives way to the sploosh majority, and he drinks from cardboard cups. But now… this. He studies the perfect striations of brown and white, then tips the glass and drinks. _Presto._ Andre plays there again the following week, and he finds himself slipping up, on a piece he has played since he was six. These are small flaws: releasing a chord too early, dropping a note from an arpeggio. No one notices. But it bothers him. He understands that perfection is not, logically speaking, attainable. But if you aren’t going to at least chase it, what’s the purpose? He knows what it is. Too many of his focal points are occupied by the image of Roxanne’s latte. He takes an early break, and requests his free drink. “Double latte?” she asks. “Exactly the same.” “Ah.” She smiles. “A connoisseur.” She clicks the grounds into a disc and slides it into the machine. Andre stands at the counter, watching. “So what do you call it?” he asks. “Parfait? Striped?” Roxanne twitches her lips in thought. “Pretty-style.” “Pretty style.” She laughs. “I know. Corny. But it’s the only expression everyone seems to understand.” She pours the milk, then lays in the foam, till it comes to an inch from the top. Then she brings the shot cup to the edge of the glass. “No!” says Andre. “You pour it freehand? No spoon?” Roxanne smiles, keeping her eye on the hot brown trickle. “All you need… is the fine touch… of a neuro… surgeon.” A dark line appears between milk and foam, and rises to a solid band, as if someone has painted it on the glass. She covers her entry spot with a cap of foam, then stands back to admire her work. “You are a goddess of the caffeine arts,” says Andre, taking his prize. That night, Andre crosses his front lawn, huffing steam into the cold air. He pauses and sets down his guitar case. A full moon is filtering the madrone, silvering its smooth limbs. Reminding Andre of Roxanne’s shoulders, bare and slender, turning away as the espresso bites into his tongue. Roxanne realizes that her job is predominantly social. She also knows that her age and appearance fall into a certain type – tall, high-cheekboned, girl-next-door (Julia Roberts comes up) – and she is a magnet for heartbroken forty-year-olds. But most of them want just a conversation, a smile. Just the fact that she remembers their names and favorite drinks brightens their faces. She is careful to draw boundaries, but time is her friend – always another customer, another chore to keep the encounter brief. And they all understand. She is protective of her true affections – rarely gives them out – and is very clear on the type of man who buzzes her circuits. He is big, a barrel-chested guy who could squeeze her to a pulp. Not that she _wants_ that, but just the idea of all that suppressed force… In the old high-school fantasy game, her picks would be Russell Crowe, a young Sean Connery, Brando in _Streetcar._ Slight, effeminate Andre doesn’t stand a chance – until he starts playing. The deftness of his fingering captivates her. His choice of material – piano transcriptions from Poulenc and Satie – has her lifting in her shoes to listen. He also knows a good musical joke, smuggling a quote from “Hotel California” into a Granados tango. She’s the only one who notices. There’s a reason for this. Roxanne is a piano student. Her teachers love her playing, and encourage her to give recitals. But her ears tell her differently. She knows that perfection is a ruthless master, but she wants to be at least somewhere in the same county before she exposes herself to an audience. She tells no one about her studies – not even her closest friends – and when she hears someone like Andre, her feelings are confirmed. The thing with the lattes catches her off-guard. She never realized they were so exceptional – but then, she’s never had such a knowledgeable audience. It reminds her of the trip she took to Italy, where espresso is almost a religion. And it gives her hope. If her hands are really so adept, perhaps someday they will master Rachmaninoff. Still, these feelings are self-centered and intellectual – not the same as attraction. Perhaps Andre’s lack of manliness is the price for his brilliant sensitivity. They are working a bright, cold Sunday when Roxanne feels a sound at her shoulder, like a rustling newspaper. When she turns, a dark blur flings itself at her head. She ducks and lets out a girly shriek. The blur zips across the room and strikes the window with a sharp _thwack!__Oh, God,_ she thinks. _It’s a bird._ With lots of door traffic and lots of crumbs, this happens at least once a month, but she never gets used to it. The customers panic; the bird panic. The plate glass affords a deadly illusion. The first impact renders this one semi-conscious. He settles on a windowsill, a dark brown sparrow blinking his eyes like a boxer on the mat. The customers buzz and chatter. The music stops. Andre paces across the room, holding out his sportcoat like a shield. He brings it to the sill, trapping the sparrow underneath, then bunches the sides into a sack. He carries his package outside, wingflaps ticking the fabric, then settles his coat to the ground and whips it away like a magician’s cape. The bird shoots off for the nearest tree. Andre watches him go, then re-enters to applause and whistles. He returns to his chair and says, “For my next trick, I will play the guitar!” Roxanne feels a pleasant tingle running the roof of her mouth. Roxanne’s closest friend is I-Chun, a Taiwanese tomboy who wears thin rectangular spectacles, several piercings and a white skunk-stripe through her jet-black hair. When she smells a clove cigarette, she knows that Roxanne is troubled, and retreats to the back alley to find out why. “‘Zup, girlfriend?” She slides down the wall to sit next to her on the sidewalk. Roxanne takes a long drag. The sharp spice numbs the end of her tongue. “Guy.” “‘Nother strappin’ lothario?” “Nah. Guitarist.” “That guy from NedRed? I didn’t think you went for longhairs.” “Classical guitarist.” I-Chun bugs out her eyes in that way she knows she’s good at. “Geez!” says Roxanne. “No need to go all Academy Award on me.” “You’re going a bit far afield, Roxy. But… what’s the problem?” Roxanne squints her eyes and takes another drag. “Goddamn lattes. All he ever talks about.” “Well, you are the Queen of…” “Stop right there!” Roxanne waves a threatening finger. “There is more to yours truly than a… beverage. I am a luscious piece of feminine flesh, and I am about ready to hear that from someone besides myself.” “You are a luscious piece of feminine flesh.” “And the moment I go lezzie, you’re at the top of my list. But back to my point.” “Do you have anything else in common?” Roxanne hesitates. Is it time to tell I-Chun about pianos? “No,” she answers. “Not a thing.” I-Chun takes the cigarette and steals a puff. “I got it,” she says. “Change the pattern of discourse. Fuck one up.” “Fuck up a… latte?” I-Chun makes a motion like a witch throwing two toads into a pot. “Sploosh! Give him the world’s doggiest latte.” “Oh, not sploosh! Wouldn’t I be breaking some ethical code?” “The hell with ethics! This is sex.” “Or romance.” “Whichever you want, honey.” Andre places the glass on the counter like the first exhibit in a homicide case. Roxanne stops, mid-cappuccino, and pretends to look puzzled. “Hi. What’s up?” “Excuse the language, Roxanne, but what… is that?” “What language?” “Fill in the blanks.” Roxanne shouts “Double cap!” to the coffeehouse, then returns to Andre. “Sorry. I was in a hurry. I can make another, if you like.” “Well, yes! Geez, Roxanne, I didn’t think you were even capable of something like this.” “Is that the only reason you like me?” She tries to make it a joke, but comes up short. Andre thinks about it. “If I played really crappy, strummy guitar, would you still like me?” “Yes!” “But would you think less of me?” She sighs, defeated. “Yes. Because your playing is lovely.” “There! It’s no crime for me to appreciate the care and skill you put into your work.” This is all well and logical, but it’s pissing her off. And there’s a customer at the register. Does he have no psychic power at all? Does she really have to put this into words? “Name one other thing you like about me. You have five seconds.” He leans into the counter. “You have the most elegant shoulders I have ever seen.” Andre sits in his basement apartment, watching television. _That’s it. I’ve killed off a perfectly good gig. Why couldn’t I just say she had a nice smile?_ Roxanne sits at her dining room table. She spies her reflection in the window. She turns sideways. Andre is cordial, friendly, but no closer. He natters on about lattes as if he has been banned from talking about anything else. “A spell,” says I-Chun. Roxanne raises her eyebrows in that way she knows she’s good at. “You _are_ kidding.” I-Chun throws her hands up. “I’ve got nothin’ to work with. Why don’t you just ask him out?” “No. I need him to ask me out.” “Jesus! Hop a bus into the twenty-first century.” “It’s not about that. It’s because I have no idea if he’s really interested. Oh, God. Do you suppose he’s gay?” “Hah!” says I-Chun. “You supermodels are all alike. ‘If he doesn’t like me, he’s _got_ to be gay.’ A spell, sister. That’s my last word.” I-Chun heads back inside as Roxanne complains after her: “But I don’t know any spells!” Two hours later, it’s time for Andre’s break. Roxanne fills the disc with espresso and looks around. Cardamom – the spice they use for Turkish coffee. She shakes it into the grounds and locks the disc into the machine. Under the hiss, she leans close to the shot cup and whispers, “Courage.” She is stacking chairs on tables when Andre stops by, guitar case in hand. “Was there something… different tonight?” “Sure. I added some cardamom.” “I like it,” he says. “Good.” A silence drifts in like a tule fog. Lots of room for someone to ask someone out on a date. Maybe they could meet for a cup of coffee. “Well,” he says. “Gotta go!” “Goodnight,” says Roxanne. She lifts another chair. Andre sits on his couch, working through a new Scarlatti. _It’s getting worse! That look on her face. She’s so popular. It seems like half the town knows her. What’m I doing even thinking about it? Oh, Jesus, Andre – read the fucking music._ Roxanne continues the cardamom, to no discernible effect. If anything, Andre seems more distant – even vaguely annoyed. Then he’s gone, replaced by a guy named Martin. Roxanne stops by on his break. “Do you know Andre?” “Sure,” says Martin. “He’s in my composition class. He sort of passed this gig on to me.” “Did he say why?” “Heavy class load, somethin’ like that.” “Oh. Okay. Thanks.” “Hey, thanks for the latte. It was screamin’.” “Yeah. No problem.” The next three months are winter. The short days and foul weather conspire to drive Roxanne into the ground. Even the snow, which used to excite her. Now it reminds her of lost chances, the dying earth – some connection she has failed to make. She spends hours in her rehearsal room playing Schubert sonatas and Chopin nocturnes, forcing the sad music into her veins so she can bleed it back out. On the first day of March, she sits in a corner with her biology textbook. A shadow comes over her table like a stormcloud. The stormcloud is Andre. “Andre! Where’ve you… It’s good to see you.” “It’s good to see you. I’ve been kinda… busy. But today’s been a rough day, and I thought, What you really need is one of Roxanne’s perfect lattes. But I guess… you’re not on?” “No. But I’ll make you one. Be right back.” Roxanne sprinkles cardamom into the disc, whispers “Courage,” then stands there, staring into the cup._What the hell am I doing?_ She fills a glass with ice and pours in the espresso, then drinks it down at a shot. Shards of light bulbs tinkle into her brain stem. Then she makes a perfect latte. “Here ya go, sailor.” “Ah, perfection!” says Andre. “Thanks. I’ll leave you to your studies.” “No,” says Roxanne. “There’s a price for this service. You will sit here while I pick your brain.” Andre smiles and joins her. “Sure. Whatcha got?” “Well, first – that transcription from Ravel. Where did you find that? You see, I’m studying piano, and I…” Roxanne plays piano at the university in Boulder, Colorado. She plays for grades, but really she plays for Andre, King of Guitar, who listens from the front row.

# Third Wave Water Review: Can Mineral Packets Make Better Coffee? [Brewing Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/brewing-coffee/)---by [Michael Allen Smith](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/michael-allen-smith/)![Third Wave Water Review: Can Mineral Packets Make Better Coffee?](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/third-wave-water-review/third-wave-water-minerals.jpg) Around 2005, I took a tour of Stone Brewing in Escondido, California. During the tour, I learned that one of the first steps they take when making their ales is to strip all the minerals out of the water and then rebuild the water using a custom mineral blend. The custom blend was designed to mimic the water used in the Burton region of England, which has been known for producing outstanding ales for hundreds of years. Stone knew what they were doing. They have won numerous awards, and many other microbreweries pay close attention to getting the right water profile for their beer recipes. ### But what about coffee? For the longest time, the general advice has been a vague directive to use clean water and that the water should taste good by itself. In other words, don’t try to make good coffee with water you don’t like. This simple advice works, but it is not the end of the story. Coffee can taste better or worse depending upon the mineral profile of the water used. In Italy, the roast profiles get darker as you go from the North to the South. In the Scandinavian countries, the mineral profile matches their light roasting profiles. Chromatic Coffee in Santa Clara, California, has two water inputs for their espresso machine. Each water is custom-built via filtration to get the exact TDS (total dissolved solids) to match the roast profile of the two espressos. The lighter espresso gets water with less TDS. How is the taste? Unbelievable. I spent a year in the Bay Area, and they were the best. They pulled delicate flavors out of espresso that I didn’t even think was possible. ### Custom Water For Us Roasters and cafes are tweaking their water profiles to improve the taste of their coffee. But what about the home brewer? Third Wave Water has tackled this problem by creating two custom mineral profiles: Classic and Espresso. Add a packet to a gallon of distilled water, and you should have a water profile that improves the taste of your coffee. Third Wave Water adds magnesium for sweetness and calcium for a balanced body. They highlight the coffee’s acidity, but the profile has low alkalinity. I asked Third Wave to explain the difference between the two mineral profiles. Here was their response: > The primary difference between the Espresso and Classic profile is the buffer (potassium bicarbonate) added in the Espresso formula. This ingredient is added because espresso machines have a unique issue with high pressure and high temperature creating a higher probability of the minerals separating from the water. The Classic profile also uses a touch of sodium (10 mg/10 ounce cup of coffee) instead of the buffer ingredient providing a brighter cup of coffee for drip coffee machines, French Press, pour overs, etc.![mix third wave water](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/third-wave-water-classic.R47JS75A_ZQynd0.webp) ### Testing Third Wave Water Since Third Wave provides the ideal mineral content, you probably don’t want to add it directly to anything but distilled water. If you have a water filtration system that removes most of the minerals, you could give it a try. However, only a head-to-head test with the packet mixed with distilled water will let you know how much difference you can detect. The first thing I did was compare my tap water, which I use to make coffee, to the Classic profile of the Third Wave Water mixed with distilled water. Water vs. water. If I couldn’t tell a difference with plain water, then it would be unlikely that I would once the coffee was brewed. I live in Seattle, where the water quality is already close to ideal for coffee brewing. This partially explains why the coffee culture in the Pacific Northwest has outpaced other regions of the country. Because of this, I didn’t expect to notice as much of a difference as if living in a region with less-than-ideal water for coffee brewing. To my pleasant surprise, the Third Wave Water was better. The word that best describes the difference is silky. The clean taste of the water lingered on the tongue just a bit longer than my tap water. My tap water is excellent, so for the Third Wave to noticeably improve upon that flavor was impressive. I would later repeat these results with brewed coffee. I drink primarily lighter-roasted coffees, and I noticed that some of the delicate flavors were more pronounced. They stayed with me a bit longer than the coffee made with untreated water. The coffee seemed more balanced with the Third Wave Water. ### Conclusion Third Wave Water is a great option for coffee lovers who want to improve their water profile for brewing. If you want to see how much of a difference an optimized mineral profile makes for coffee, give Third Wave Water a test for yourself. ### Resources [Water Profiling: Chromatic Coffee](https://freshcup.com/water-profiling-chromatic-coffee/) – Fresh Cup article on Chromatic Coffee’s water setup.

# The Quantified Coffee Drinker [Coffee and Health](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/coffee-health/)---by [Michael Allen Smith](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/michael-allen-smith/)![The Quantified Coffee Drinker](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/the-quantified-coffee-drinker/daily_coffee__3_day_moving_avg.png) It seems like every month or so, someone sends me a link to some health study involving coffee. I used to read them, but I don’t anymore. People have been drinking coffee for a very long time. A simple observation will tell you we coffee drinkers are not dropping dead like smokers or outliving the non-coffee drinkers. In my opinion, the change in a person’s health outcome as a result of coffee is minor and highly personalized. And that effect can change over time. We all know someone who can drink massive amounts of coffee all day long and sleep like a baby. We might also know someone who is so sensitive to coffee that a single cup could keep them awake all night long. I know a guy who stayed awake for almost three days after drinking several cups of green tea. What affects your sleep will directly affect your health outcome. When studies make blanket statements that coffee prevents this or that, they fail to look at the individual response to caffeine. ### Good Sleep for Good Health Good sleep is essential for good health. As coffee drinkers, our goal is to consume coffee only until sleep quality is impaired. About 10 years ago, I drank an insane amount of coffee daily. From when I woke up until night, I’d slam mugs of [French press coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/troubleshooting-french-press-coffee/). My adrenals were so exhausted by the end of the day that I would fall asleep immediately. But over time, I noticed that I was waking earlier and earlier. Despite still being tired, I’d be up making more coffee. I came up with an experiment. I pushed my last coffee back to 6 p.m. My sleep improved. Then I moved my last coffee to 4 p.m., and it improved again. Then I moved it to 2 p.m. and saw no additional improvement. So, for a few years, I had my last cup of coffee between 2 p.m. and 4 p.m. It yielded me the best quality of sleep. ### Collect Data A movement called The Quantified Self has emerged in the past few years. With spreadsheets and gadgets, tracking data about our lives and adjusting our behavior is now possible. Collect more data and then adjust again. From the Wired article _Know Thyself: Tracking Every Facet of Life, from Sleep to Mood to Pain, 24/7/365_ by Gary Wolf: > Numbers are making their way into the smallest crevices of our lives. We have pedometers in the soles of our shoes and phones that can post our location as we move around town. We can tweet what we eat into a database and subscribe to Web services that track our finances. There are sites and programs for monitoring mood, pain, blood sugar, blood pressure, heart rate, cognitive alacrity, menstruation, and prayers. Even sleep-a challenge to self-track, obviously, since you’re unconscious-is yielding to the skill of the widget maker. With an accelerometer and some decent algorithms, you will soon be able to record your sleep patterns with technology that costs less than $100. That article was written in 2009. Today, there are 99-cent apps you can put on your iPod or iPhone that measure your sleep quality by how much the bed moves. The Sleep Cycle application even makes a nice graph.![Sleep Cycle app](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/sleep-cycle-screenshot1.MlG4VCat_ZfjSjm.webp)_Sleep Cycle_ You can also use a wrist-based tracker such as the _Fitbit_. ### What To Track? If we combine data about our sleep with data about our coffee intake, then we dial in the optimal level of coffee for us individually. So far, I haven’t used any of the iPhone applications. This article aimed to see what I could learn without going high-tech. So, I just used a simple spreadsheet. Some of the variables that I have tracked or am currently tracking include: - Date - Quantity of coffee - Sleep quality (1 to 5) - Time of last coffee - Daytime mood (1 to 5) - Did I consume chocolate? I discovered that the more complicated you make the tracking, the less likely you’ll maintain the data. ### Studying My Data One of my goals in 2011 was to reduce my coffee intake. Instead of going cold turkey, I gradually declined. Tracking my coffee intake allowed me to see my progress. The chart below shows my daily pattern of coffee intake. I also added a 3-day moving average to smooth out the lines for those days that weren’t typical.![coffee intake chart](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/daily_coffee__3_day_moving_avg.B5h_W7ei_Z18IKqC.webp)_My coffee intake was from March 24, 2011 – December 24, 2011. The red line is a 3-day moving average._ After my coffee detox, I wanted to learn more about the relationship between coffee intake and sleep quality. Every morning, when I woke up, I assigned a score of 1 to 5 for sleep quality. A score of 5 would be perfect sleep. Later, I started tracking the time of day when I had my last coffee. After almost three months of data collection, here are the average sleep quality scores I got. Coffee Intake Sleep Quality 2 3.23 3**3.72** 4+ 3.48 Then, I divided the data into two groups based on my last coffee intake. Coffee Intake Sleep Q (Last Coffee BEFORE 1 PM) Sleep Q (Last Coffee AFTER 1 PM) 2 3.42 3.00 3 3.50**3.76** 4+ 3.25 3.52 So far, it appears that my sweet spot is three coffees a day, with the last coffee consumed after 1 p.m. Going forward, I plan on figuring out the optimal hour to consume my last coffee. ### Dialing in Your Sweet Spot I believe that doing a few months weeks of tracking your coffee intake and sleep quality will tell you more about the benefits of coffee than any health study. Look at the data and dial the level that works best for you. Does your sleep suffer? How much? Only you can answer these questions. ### Quantified Self Caveat (October 2014) The first version of this article was written in January 2012. Since then, I’ve learned a lot about self-tracking. Keep your experiment short. If you don’t see obvious patterns, then one probably doesn’t exist. Human data can be messy. Many other items can affect sleep quality, and coffee is just one. ### Resources [Better Sleep for the Too Early Riser](https://criticalmas.org/2014/10/better-sleep-early-riser/) – My sleep tips.

# The Tombs [Cafe Culture](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/cafe-culture/)---by [Billy Talen](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/billy-talen/)![The Tombs](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/the-tombs/rev-billy-starbucks1.jpg) I am typing this out, trying to read this scrawled-in-jail writing – it’s Thursday morning already and I’m reading Thomas Merton and thinking about going to jail a third time, and not liking it, but wondering about it. ### Why am I Here in This Jail? What am I doing in this jail? It’s amazing how quickly the iron bars make me question the whole thing. The Tombs. How does this hell-hole connect with Starbucks policies, with coffee trademarks, with a starving kid in East Africa? Maybe Bono is right. He’s not in jail. He’s in the news. Maybe I should shop more.![Rev Billy Preaching Outside Starbucks](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/rev-billy-starbucks1.D6i1SdaM_1kYlwy.webp)_Rev Billy Preaching Outside Starbucks_ by [Fred Askew](http://www.fredaskew.com/). Yeah, but not for Starbucks Coffee, that’s for sure. I’m in jail, but stealing the names of coffees from farm families who can’t feed their kids? – no, I won’t buy a Starbucks latte. I’ll repeat this to myself until it is obvious again. Watching that movie _Black Gold_ really hit me hard – that scene where the 4-year-old boy is brought into the Starvation Center by his mother. So maybe that’s why I’m in jail, to have nothing but the wall to stare at, with the blood smears and initials carved into the concrete with car keys. I can be my own projectionist here. I can screen Black Gold with my imagination – against this bruised blank wall, as the hours pass by. The young mother is standing there with me. I’m a techno-ghost, now in Ethiopia, standing next to her. The health people are studying her boy to see if he qualifies as officially starving. The belly is distended. The eyes are unhappy, the legs wobbly. But the height and weight ratio isn’t distressing enough. The formula for starvation is not established. Now I’m watching the mother carry the boy out of the compound, as the doctors and nurses try to look away. On The Tombs wall, her eyes circle in a penetrating gaze, looking over the African horizon.![Reverend Billy Arrested ](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/rev-billy-arrest.0nw6Mr_a_ZYBf0b.webp)_Reverend Billy Arrested_  I remember how she glowered on the silver screen, when I watched the film up in the West Village, with a roomful of Fair Trade coffee activists, and probably a Starbucks spy or two. The mother was gazing out at her land, her famous volcanic Ethiopian hills, the birthplace of coffee. Her land was an impenetrable riddle. She walked as a mother, carrying this heavy boy with his big head flopping on her shoulder – she walked back into the land that had mothered her. But carrying the boy, she had a number clenched in her mind: the required time before she could return to prove her inability as a mother, and to prove the inability of the mothering of this Ethiopia, even as it ships its elite coffee, from “the birthplace of coffee,” as advertised by Starbucks with that wonderful advertising phrase, and sold at the premium price to the coffeephiles, with indigenous Sidamo graphics. It sells as high as $26 a pound. The blow-by-blow description of these ironies… Well, Ironies Abound! In the modern world, painful ironies, recounted vividly, can count as high art, journalism, or some other ism. Irony can be enough. Or guilt can be enough, too. I’ve had all those middle-distance emotions. I’ve been satisfied with them. They have stopped me. I can’t be in such an awful jail to deepen my artistic or liberal emotions. If that’s all this is then I should join Bono and simply go shopping. If that’s all this is I’ll end up crossing my legs in the afternoon, sitting in the Astor Place Starbucks, completely de-politicized, with that latte steaming in front of me. What I have to do here, in The Tombs — I have to find out: what is the equivalent of the Boston Tea Party, of the Montgomery bus strike, of the Emma Goldman sweatshop sermons in Union Square? How can I change things by what we do with my body? What word would I shout in what direction? What seat do I sit in? What doorway do I stand in? I need to know. Because we have a riddle in our land too… We have the riddle of American Democracy. We are told that this is the place where change can begin. There is something that compassionate people can do that begins change and that change can travel in a growing change around the world, and reach a child and his mother.![Rev Billy Frisked by Cops](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/rev-billy-frisked.CUIl6Ngv_18SlSM.webp)_Rev Billy Frisked by Cops_ I stare at my land with the same gaze as that mother. Here is also a country that has become an impenetrable riddle. So rich and vast, and so hellbent on not sharing, on hoarding, on using the word freedom as violence against others. I stare at the wall of The Tombs, with thousands of citizens of color standing, sitting, laying on the floor, staring too, all of us forced into these underground rooms. The fluorescent lights are never off. I know why I’m in The Tombs. I will have a thought – a creative jolt. I will unpack that thought and will come to an answer to the riddle, as Rosa Parks did, as did Cleve Jones and Cesar Chavez and that beautiful Ethiopian mother did. They are whispering to me that when I’m free, I can relax farther into being unafraid._Bill Talen, created the character of [Reverend Billy and the Church of Stop Shopping](https://revbilly.com/).__Photos by [Fred Askew](http://www.fredaskew.com/)._ Published on March 1, 2007--- #### Billy Talen [Follow Billy Talen on X](https://x.com/revbillytalen)Reverend Billy is a character invented by Bill Talen.

# The Poplite Air Popper: a Cheap Home Coffee Roaster [Roasting Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/roasting-coffee/)---by [Eugene Hanks](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/eugene-hanks/)![The Poplite Air Popper: a Cheap Home Coffee Roaster](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/the-poplite-air-popper-a-cheap-home-coffee-roaster/31OAC-ca0pL.jpg) Unless you have an industrial capacity exhaust fan in your kitchen do not attempt to use this in your house. Air roasting beans produces quite a bit of smoke, so roast on your porch or at least outside. Yes, I’m talking about using an air popcorn popper. I will show you what to buy, how to modify it (optional), and how to use it. The “Presto Poplite Gourmet Hot Air Popper” sells for less than $20. If you can’t find the Poplite, buy the cheapest air popper you can find. Used is OK, but don’t expect to use it for popcorn ever again. I dismantled mine because I wanted more airflow around the base. It seemed to perform better and didn’t shut itself off due to overheating. It might happen to you, but just let it cool down and resume. Overloading the hopper can overheat the machine, too. If you decide to modify, you will need the following: 1. A Phillips head screwdriver 2. A cordless drill or drill and small drill bits 3. Some small screws 4. Wire snips (maybe) 5. Electrical tape In any case, you will need: 1. A can (tomato, soup- whatever) that fits into the Popper Hopper with both ends removed. 2. A towel for when you roast 3. A colander, sieve, steaming basket- you get the idea 4. Extension cord- the longer, the better. Don’t go overboard with the hundred-footer- use common sense. The idea is to get away from your dwelling. You will thank me later. 5. A stirrer of some sort (optional) 6. Flashlight if you roast at night. Skip this portion if you decide not to modify it, but read it anyway. Undo all screws to remove the entire plastic casing around the popper. You will end up with this:![Remove screws from base of popper](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/000_0022c.jcj4uzSm_Z17toKc.webp)_Remove screws from the base of the popper._ To get the cord out you will either have to cut the thin wires (keeping careful note of what goes where) or **destroy the plastic casing** if there are not the plastic cone thingies connecting the wires together. These are called wire screws, and they join wires safely- just twist them off. Putting them back is the reverse. Reconnect the wires and wrap them all together in electrical tape to keep everything neat, clean, and safe.![Deconstructed Poplite](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/000_0023c.DA7hqpx8_ZmiOFq.webp)_Deconstructed Poplite_ Drill a little hole down each leg to put the metal base back on. This is where you will screw in the little screws to hold the base on. You can also skip this, but the popper will be more stable and less likely to tip over. There is a tapered metal “sleeve” that forms the inside of the hopper. If you modified, you will have to place it upside down so that it fits over the lip it originally sat in. Drill two small holes through the sleeve into the lip- one on each side. Insert screw and tighten. This will prevent the sleeve from falling off at the worst possible moment- when you are pouring out your roasted beans- and dumping the contents on the ground. Your open-ended can should fit snugly over the top of this sleeve, creating a chimney. If you don’t do this, when your beans get lighter, they will fly all over the place. I started with three cans originally but reduced it to one with experimentation. **If you didn’t modify it, you still need the can.**![Soup can chimney](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/000_0026c.BpT5VX84_Z2aLFhr.webp)_Soup can chimney_ You are ready now to roast. But you need to consider some things: 1. Do not burn your house down or anyone else’s. Use common sense and roast away from wooden structures, i.e., 10 feet plus. There is little risk of this, but if you leave your roaster unattended, you are asking for trouble. 2. The smoke is nasty, and there will be a lot of it as well as chaff blowing out. I keep doors and windows shut and the roaster away. 3. Know your “cracks”. This will take some experimentation if you are a novice, but generally, the chaff begins to fly around the 1st crack, and a full-city (French?) is towards the end of the 2nd crack. There should be a lot of smoke and smell at this point. Some beans skip the first and slide into the second crack, so watch the beans for color changes. If you see smoke… you are almost there, depending on what you want. You might have passed up your desired roast. Anyway, the idea is to keep an ear and an eye on your beans at all times! 4. This roaster roasts rapidly after the first roast, even in very cool weather. Now you are ready to roast, and you have set up everything. You are prepared and have your tools at hand: the colander, the towel, and your beans. You are wearing clothes that you don’t mind smelling of coffee smoke. Plug the roaster into the extension cord and let it run for a few seconds to warm up. Hopefully, your beans are in a large yogurt or Starbucks cup. Something you can squeeze slightly and easily pour the beans into the roaster. While looking into the roaster pour enough beans into the reservoir but not too much. 1/3 of a cup is about right. The beans should be moving actively in the middle. After a few seconds, give the roaster a shake by grasping one of the legs. This should help dislodge any beans and help them move. I do this instead of stirring. I repeat the shake periodically as the roast progresses. Listen for the cracks. Watch the chaff start to fly out the top. Give it a look to see what the color looks like as the roast progresses. See the beans begin to dance as they lose moisture. When a substantial column of smoke is coming out of the roaster, you should be well into the second crack; the beans look dark and oily. If you are ready to stop (recommended) unplug the cord, grab your towel and lift off the can. Grab the roaster by a leg and pour the beans out into the colander giving it a rap to free up any beans that remain. At this point, I repeat the process. Once I have it going again, I swish the beans around to cool them and inspect the roast. You may see some variation. Some beans may be lighter. The really light yellow-looking beans get tossed back in the roaster. As you pour in the next batch swish them into the 1st batch. I find that as I progress the residual heat evens out the color of the beans and the roast is fairly homogenous. In fact, I think the variations give the flavor a deeper complexity than roasts that are perfectly monochromatic. I am likely to roast a pound of green beans at a time. I expect to see a 10 to 15 percent loss in weight during the roast, but the volume of the beans will double. I also have developed my own blends, and you will, too. A blend should have a base with 1 or 2 other varieties singing backup. Of course, this is your own choice, and you can mix and match however you want. I have a tendency to stick to a 2:1 ratio by weight (base: backup). Green coffee beans can be found easily on eBay or elsewhere on the internet. I buy in bulk: 5 to 20 pounds. Again use your common sense and practice wise shopping habits. Do a little research. Think twice before buying that 50 lb bag of beans. If you are reading this you already have passed into a realm far beyond most coffee drinkers. When I began to roast my beans it was as great of a conceptual leap forward as all of my other educational coffee experiences combined. I began to look at roasts and purveyors with a critical eye, knowing that I could outdo them at home for less money. I realized that Starbucks is inconsistent with its roast as well as many other sellers of “gourmet” coffees. I still frequent these places but I do so with greater awareness. If you take these extra simple steps you too will experience coffee as it should be and your life as it pertains to that “good ol’cuppa joe” will never be the same again. ### Resources [Hacking the Orville Redenbacher Hot Air Popper to Roast Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/poplite-coffee-roaster/) – Detailed tutorial on modifying the PopLite popper.

# The World’s First Coffee Pot: Turkish Coffee [Brewing Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/brewing-coffee/)---by [Natasha Williams](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/natasha-williams/)![The World’s First Coffee Pot: Turkish Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/the-worlds-first-coffee-pot-turkish-coffee/turkish-coffee.jpg) Turkish coffee is simple and romantic, the way it was first made as a coffee drink. Turkish coffee is not the kind of coffee you grab on the way to work. It is a coffee for quiet enjoyment. Turkish coffee is especially good for those who love… life! Turkish coffee was invented as a drink during the 16th century in the Middle East–brewed in little pots called ibriks or cezves. From Egypt, it spread through the Middle East, and then into Europe and Russia. Today you’ll find Turkish coffee in Middle Eastern and Greek restaurants from New York to San Francisco. ### Grind and Pot Essential Essential to making Turkish coffee, of course, is the pot, not the bean. Any bean can be prepared as Turkish Coffee. You simply need a good hand mill or commercial grinder that grinds to Turkish. Most grinders in America, even if they say Turkish, will not grind to the powdery fine texture needed for a good Turkish — finer than espresso. _(See [Coffee Grind Chart](https://ineedcoffee.com/coffee-grind-chart/) for visual explanation)_ A Turkish mill works the best.![turkish mill](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/turkish-mill.DqAIVc_t_Z1W1lb7.webp) *Turkish Mill by Zassenhaus * Next, you need the pot.![](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/turkish-ibrik.Bc6duvhD_Li4j9.webp)_Turkish Ibrik (_ The ibrik was originally designed to brew coffee in the hot sand of the desert, but a stovetop will do fine. First, fill the ibrik 2/3 full with water, add sugar to taste (if you like your Turkish coffee sweet), and top it with a heaping teaspoon of finely ground coffee. The coffee seals the narrow top, creating an oven effect. As the water begins to boil, it will foam up through the coffee. Let it foam up three times. Stir. Pour slowly into two small demitasse cups, and it’s ready to savor. Pay attention to the foaming. It is the skill part of the process. If you don’t, your ibrik will become volcanic, and you deposit your Turkish coffee on your stove…what a loss and what a mess. ### Coffee To Water Ratios Small Ibrik: 1 demitasse cup - Water: 3 oz. - Sugar: One level teaspoon - Turkish Coffee: One heaping teaspoon - Salt: Pinch (for hard water only) Large Ibrik: 2-3 demitasse cups - Water: 12 oz. - Sugar:  3 level teaspoons - Turkish Coffee: 3-4 heaping teaspoons - Salt: One pinch (for hard water only) If your coffee boils in the ibrik, it means there is not enough coffee. There should be coffee foam at the top. For the larger ibriks, you should just experiment with varying coffee quantities using the above suggestions. Preparing Turkish coffee is more about your personal taste than reading directions on the box. Relax and enjoy the process. If you’ve got further questions, you might need to chat with the dishwasher. ### How to Pour Turkish Coffee When pouring Turkish Coffee into your cups, pour the foam first and quickly, then slowly pour the rest, allowing the coffee grounds to settle at the bottom of the ibrik. For more than one serving, spoon a little foam into each demitasse before pouring the coffee. ### Variations/Conclusion Authentic Turkish blends are different in different regions of the world; for instance, most middle eastern Turkish is spiced with cardamom and rose water; in Greece, chicory; in Libya, coriander is added. So, in fact, you can prepare Turkish at home with any available coffee bean; all you need is a cezve or ibrik. You can find those at Middle Eastern groceries in major cities or on the Net. ### Resources [Preparing Traditional Turkish Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/preparing-a-traditional-turkish-coffee/) – INeedCoffee step-by-step guide to making Turkish coffee.

# The Story of the Bialetti Moka Express [Coffee History](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/coffee-history/)---by [Myron Joshua](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/myron-joshua/)![The Story of the Bialetti Moka Express](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/the-story-of-the-bialetti-moka-express/The-Story-of-the-Bialetti-Moka-Express.jpg) Alongside and connected to the rise of Italian fascism came a revolution in the drinking habits of the Italian public. It might sound peculiar, but what has become known as THE Italian way to brew coffee in the home, Moka Pot (or Stovetop Espresso) Brewing is linked to the social, technological, and economic changes that Italian fascism advanced during the 1930s. Prof. Jeffrey T. Schnapp, in his article, “The Romance of Caffeine and Aluminum” (Critical Inquiry, Vol. 28 No. 1, Autumn 2001 U. of Chicago), covers this ground in detail. Schnapp shows how the Italian desire to move into the era of modernity in the early 20th century was expressed through the “marriage” between two, ostensibly very different materials, caffeine and aluminum. While my article summarizes him, I must accept all responsibility for any additions, misinterpretations, or mistakes that may have entered it.![Bialetti Ad In Trade Fair Catalog](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/bialetti-moka-express-ad1-e1407979493698.BQzsCEFX_Z2aLjJd.webp)_Bialetti Ad In Trade Fair Catalog_ Caffeine and Aluminum are two materials that carry a common symbolism linking them to the age of modernity: Lightness, speed, and mobility, strength, energy, and electricity are terms that fit both these materials and are associated with the new lifestyle that modern man was seeking. ### Coffee and Aluminum: Icons of Modernity While both caffeine and aluminum were isolated (or discovered) in the early to mid-19th century, it was the fascist drive to make Aluminum the national metal of Italy in the 1930s that brought these two materials together in a way that would affect every Italian home! In 1933, Alfonso Bialetti fashioned and crafted the first Aluminum Stovetop espresso coffee maker. This coffee machine, the Moka Express, would find itself in 90% of all Italian homes (as well as in the Guinness Book of Records), thus changing the essence of Italian coffee culture. Bialetti changed not only the coffee brewing technique but also the Italian social fabric. Coffee was generally consumed publicly. Public coffeehouses dominated the coffee trade in all aspects, from buying and selling to roasting and consumption. They were the birthplaces of many ideological and political movements throughout Europe. Public coffee consumption was the realm of the male who made the coffee bar his home away from home. Women’s consumption of coffee was associated with their move to emancipation. Inventors sought how to use new developments in technology to create better and more powerful coffee machines for the public sphere. The coffeehouse was associated with the developing modern psyche. _(On the other hand, domestic coffee machines remained quite “tame”, being simple and basic.)_ Increased consciousness of the effect Caffeine had on the individual also served as a catalyst for these developments. Caffeine, isolated in 1820, was associated with creativity, agitation, and activity, Honore de Balzac wrote of the effects of coffee: > Ideas surge forth like the battalions of a great army…Memories attack with their banners unfurled…witticisms appear as sharpshooters. Figures begin to take shape. The paper covers itself with ink for the mighty labor begins and ends with torrents of black water… Decades later, the Italian founder of the Futurist movement would call himself the “caffeine of Europe,” who, as Schnapp writes, “envisaged himself both as a purgative agent, dedicated to freeing Europe from its idolatry of the past, and as a new sort of industrial-era human being-a hyperactive multiplied man…” These developments and concepts gave birth to what was to become THE ultimate Italian form of coffee: Café Espresso, a strong and powerfully intense cup. The 19th century saw a number of attempts to brew coffee with steam. The goal was to brew a strong cup of coffee very quickly. One coffee brewer actually took the shape of a train locomotive (see image), highlighting the connection between speed and power and the use of water boilers used for both modern travel and making “modern” coffee. In 1901, Luigi Bezzera filed his first patent for a large espresso machine. Like the railroad locomotives, this machine was a dazzling piece of equipment, loud, shining with brass fittings, and manned by its own “train engineer”, the professional barista.![Locomotive Coffee Machine](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/locomotive-coffee-machine.CvpbRqqM_1i3bga.webp)_Locomotive Coffee Machine_ The Italian artist Leonetto Cappiello beautifully captured this association in the 1922 advertising poster created for _“La Victoria Aduino”_, manufacturer of espresso machines.![La Victoria Aduino](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/cappiello-victoria-arduino-1922.BTAF61Lp_14WFGe.webp)_La Victoria Aduino by L. Cappiello (1922)_ How different is it from the simple coffee machines, like the Napolitana, which are still used in the home? The home machines were like sedate tea brewers that brewed by letting hot water gently trickle over the coffee grinds. The Espresso brewed at the public coffee bar “was power-packed, intense, and quickly consumed It translated the values of efficiency and excitement associated with the express train into an everyday beverage. In comparison to coffeehouse espresso, the domestic coffee was but a slow and pallid imitation.” (Schnapp p 251). One can understand how the Espresso Bar became a magnet for the Italian man. But in 1933, Alfonso Bialetti invented a brewing system that changed the image of domestic coffee in Italy. His chances for success increased as the invention brought about the marriage of two materials, aluminum and coffee. Beyond their appeal as symbols of modernity, these two substances were significant to the Italian nation during the 1930s. ### The Italian Commitment to Aluminum Fascism’s “March on Rome” wanted to create a break with the past and at once restore Italy to its old glory. The use of Aluminum would suit this two-fold desire. In a huge national advertising campaign during the ’30s, Aluminum would be described as being both AVIONAL and ANTICORODAL. “Avional”-from the word meaning “airplane”, would suggest the modern technological aspect, highlighting both speed and strength. “Anticorodal”, and “non-corroding”, would highlight traditional values, everlasting and sturdy. Beyond this double symbolism, Aluminum work was associated with the combination of high technological achievement with the traditional Italian values of craftsmanship and fine design. So it was quite natural to call Italians to “Rally” around this material as was done in a 1931 editorial: > “…(A)cknowledge that a new and decisively important protagonist has emerged in the nation’s economic life: ALUMINUM. An Italian metal, the abundance of which makes us the envy of the world…Aluminum is sure to permit us to reduce to a bare minimum the importation of other metals, freeing the Fatherland from the onerous tributes that, to this day, continue to be exacted abroad…(Aluminum) embodies Italy’s unyielding destiny!” Note the words of Arnoldo Mussolini, the brother of “il Duce”: > “We have often said: just like the 19th century was the century of iron, heavy metals and carbon, so the 20th century should be the century of light metals, electricity and petroleum. In the course of history discoveries sometimes serve as the beneficiaries of peoples. If we (Italians) haven’t iron, we have Aluminum.” Besides promising economic independence, Aluminum was seen as particularly suited to the Italian craftsman. In an article from 1932, we read: > “…we would be tempted to assert the Latinity of aluminum to the degree than other metal lends itself so well the temperament of the Latin peoples, in general and of the Italians, in particular. ..one can declare without hesitation that Italy has achieved a degree of aesthetic expressivity…that place it in the forefront.”![Hand casting Aluminum Parts](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/bialetti-production.BgkJlmgh_ZOUhgI.webp)_Hand casting Aluminum Parts in the Bialetti Factory_ Coffee was also seen as highlighting nationalistic values, particularly EMPIRE and AUTARCHY. “Empire”, in that Italy had invaded Ethiopia, a major producer of coffee beans. “Autarchy”, freedom from subjugation to the nations of the world, because Brazil had continued to supply Italy with coffee beans against League of Nations decisions to apply sanctions. ### Alfonso Bialetti Creates His Stove Top Espresso Machine Coffee, a national beverage thanks to the spread of espresso bars at the beginning of the 20th century, and Aluminum, the national metal, wed when Alfonso Bialetti returned from France, where he worked in the Aluminum industry. He started his own machine shop in 1918 in an area of Italy known, since WWI, as a center for manufacturing metal housewares. During the 1920’s Bialetti noticed the laundry methods used by local women. The wash was boiled in tubs with a central pipe in the middle. This pipe would draw the soapy water up and redistribute it over the laundry. Bialetti’s creative mind brought him to the conclusion that a simple coffee machine could be fashioned on this model and could produce real “espresso type” coffee in the private home.![Moka Express](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/moka-express.COznkJ5a_1l9qMQ.webp)_Moka Express (Exploded View)_ At this time, other Italians were busy trying to create new and better ways to brew coffee, using pressure rather than steam to extract the best from the coffee bean. However, the high-pressure, lower-than-boiling-water solutions of companies like Gaggia took years to develop. These modern “true” espresso machines would remain fairly large and costly, using complex systems to attain their superior results. Italians were still used to the steam-pressure “espresso” machines that dominated the coffeehouse scene and were, therefore, open to simpler solutions that would give them the same style of coffee at home. In 1933, after some years of tinkering and solving technical problems, Alfonso Bialetti invented the Moka Express. Bialetti’s coffee machine, made of Aluminum, was similar in shape and design to silver coffee services popular in well-to-do homes. Thus, he combined modern technology with the Italian tradition for elegance and craftsmanship. The Stovetop Espresso machine was simple and compact, yet capable of making the power-packed brew associated with the large espresso machine of the Espresso Bar. The express claim of Bialetti was that “without requiring any ability whatsoever” yet one could enjoy “in casa un espresso come al bar” (“An espresso in the home just like one in the bar.)![Bialetti Mascot](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/moustached-man.Clg9po6C_15WvMv.webp)_The Little Man with Mustache is the Bialetti Mascot_ Alfonso Bialetti had the vision and invented the Moka Express, which would remain virtually unchanged until today. But Bialetti did not have the marketing success to move the revolution forward. ### Bialetti Growth in Post-War Italy Prior to the war (1936-1940), Alfonso was able to market about 10,000 units per year. He personally sold his product at stands set up at public markets held weekly. He advanced to regional marketing but never thought in terms of a national effort or of industrializing production. The final domestication of “espresso” would have to wait until after WWII, when Alfonso’s son, Renato, returned from a German POW camp to unpack the machinery his father had packed away during the war. Renato began a massive marketing campaign. With increased sales, he had to raise production up to a rate of about 1,000 per day! He combined focus on production (dropping all the products his father used to produce besides the Moka Express) with breadth in advertising vision (utilizing billboards, radio campaigns as well as newspapers and magazines.)![Trade Fair in Milan](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/bialetti-moka-billboards.DrryWIdB_Zi8Ar3.webp)_Billboards during the Trade Fair in Milano_ During the post-war boom, competitors entered the field, and it was necessary to differentiate the Bialetti product. In 1953, Renato invented the company mascot, “omino con I baffi” (little man with a mustache). This character was a caricature of Renato’s father, Alfonso, and conjured up the image of the Italian father or dear elder family member who had lived his life in the coffeehouse. It was a symbol that evoked feelings of nostalgia and fondness. This patriarchal figure, though, is a man on the move. With his finger raised, he could be hailing a taxi or commanding attention as he ordered his espresso. Every year, Renato Bialetti “conquered” Milan during its most important annual trade show, “Fiera di Milano”. He rented every available billboard in the city and created outstanding installations. For example, in 1956, besides the booth in the Fair itself, Bialetti erected a huge outdoor sculpture consisting of a giant Moka Express supported by what looked like a stream of coffee being poured into an equally large coffee cup.![Milano Fair](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/bialetti-mocha-booth.DqXkKUhf_hS6ky.webp)_An Outdoor Installation at Milano Fair_### “Espresso in the Home Just Like in the Bar” The billboards proclaimed: “in casa un espresso come al bar” (“An espresso in the home just like one in the bar.) The little-mustached man no longer needed to find his home away from home in the neighborhood coffee bar but could bring the coffee bar into his own private house. The post-war years saw an economic boom in Italy. The Fascist period was put behind, and American-influenced values became prevalent. The Italian home became the focus of the nuclear family and increased in size and comfort. Egalitarian values meant that men would find themselves expected to be more active in the home. The advertising campaign of Bialetti fit this trend as it stressed that: 1. The Moka Pot gave you a drink at home as intense and good as what you normally get at a Coffee Bar. 2. Papa’s place was now in the kitchen where he could make his own cup of coffee. (However, he could feel as if he were playing the role of “barista” brewing a masculine beverage.) Besides addressing the social and marketing factors, Renato addressed the organizational and industrial aspects. In the 1950s, he moved production operations to a newly designed factory specially designed to move materials efficiently. He modernized while preserving quality craftsmanship at crucial stages of production. To this day, the bottom boiler unit continues to be handcrafted by expert workmen just as it had been done in 1933. With this arrangement, Renato pushed production to 18,000 pieces a day, or 4 million Moka pots per year! At this rate of production, we can well believe the claim that nearly 300,000,000 Moka pots have been sold since the 1950s. 90% of all Italian homes have at least one Moka Pot-making this a true symbol of Italy. While many competitors have moved exclusively into stainless steel models, the people of Bialetti continue to claim that the use of Aluminum improves the quality of the brew. The “interesting” aspect of this claim is that they say that the residue of coffee from previous brews adds flavor and depth to future brews. It is not recommended to clean the Moka pot too thoroughly! It is true that Aluminum is an excellent conductor of heat and even heating of the water may contribute to the quality of the brew. Bialetti’s _**Moka Express**_ continues to be a respected Italian icon. In a recent survey of Italian design, the Moka Express ranked as the fifth-best design to have come out of Italy in the 20th century. Its place of honor is alongside the likes of the 1957 Fiat 500, a 1946 Vespa, and… Nutella, which won first place. Bialetti has also added new lines of Moka Pots using stainless steel and designs that are modern and elegant. They have developed new technologies, creating electric models and a new pressure system (the Brikka system) that produces an improved cup of coffee with a layer of “crema”. As espresso technology in the coffee bars (and at home) has improved over the years, Bialetti continues to strive to offer “in casa un espresso come al bar” (An espresso in the home just like one in the bar.)![Moka Pot 1999](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/wenzel-moka-pot200.hUyM6Q0b_Kncfx.webp)_John Wenzel – Moka Pot 1999_### Resources [Stovetop Espresso Brewing Tutorial](https://ineedcoffee.com/stovetop-espresso-brewing-tutorial/) – INeedCoffee coffee brewing tutorial.

# The Smoothest Cup You’ll Ever Drink – Swedish Egg Coffee [Brewing Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/brewing-coffee/)---by [Alex Freemon](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/alex-freemon/)![The Smoothest Cup You’ll Ever Drink – Swedish Egg Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/the-smoothest-cup-youll-ever-drink-swedish-egg-coffee/Swedish-Egg-Coffee.jpg) Between panoramic fjords, the world’s greatest saunas, and wild, cold-water salmon, the Nordic region of Europe should be a place you visit at some point in your life. Barring an actual trip, you can still taste the locale by making and drinking the Swede’s unique take on java: egg coffee. Egg coffee is also known as Scandinavian coffee or Hungarian coffee. Recently listed in the article [11 Crazy Coffee Drinks You Won’t Find on a Starbucks Menu](https://ineedcoffee.com/11-crazy-coffee-drinks-you-wont-find-on-a-starbucks-menu/) here on INeedCoffee, Swedish egg coffee is dead simple to make. The result is a non-bitter, surprisingly light, and incredibly smooth cup that combines the wonderful flavor of your favorite roast with a reminiscent aftertaste of toasted cheese (trust me, it sounds strange, but it works). Ok, so to make this strange and delightful concoction, you are going to need the following: - 1 fresh egg - 1 to 1 ½ tbs of your preferred coffee, [coarsely ground](https://ineedcoffee.com/coffee-grind-chart/) (similar to what you would use for a French press) - 1 cup of water - 1 cup of ice-cold water (yes, that’s a total of 2 cups of water) - Sugar and milk to taste - Saucepan All of this together will make a single serving of coffee; multiply accordingly for the number of cups you want.![swedish egg coffee ingredients](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/image06-650x433.DPZAvWhy_ZShTPO.webp)_Necessary ingredients_### #1 Boil the Water Start boiling the first cup of water in a small pot.![coffee boil water](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/image05-650x433.D4BpHjT8_1RHkE8.webp)_Boiling Water_### #2 Crack the Egg and Stir While the water is boiling, crack the egg (with the shell) into a cup and stir.![swedish egg coffee - crack egg](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/image04-433x650.DclPO87r_2o3lFi.webp)_Cracked egg_### #3 Add the Ground Coffee Add the ground coffee to the egg and stir some more.![add ground coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/image03-433x650.Bnyjrt9-_1BEl27.webp)_Coffee and egg, pre-mixing_### #4 Add Egg-Coffee Slurry to Boiling Water Once you have the egg-coffee slurry thoroughly mixed, add it to the boiling water.![coffee egg slurry](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/image00-650x433.2wLo_iXx_Z1SyJtX.webp)_Coffee-egg slurry_### #5 Boil for 5 Minutes Let the mixture boil for 5 minutes, being careful not to overflow (because it will want to overflow).![coffee boiling 5 minutes](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/image01-433x650.B1a9GDCi_mcUWP.webp)_Boiling mixture_### #6 End Boil and Add Cold Water After boiling, remove the mixture from the heat and add the cup of ice-cold water.

# Tips for Quick and Easy Cold Brewed Iced Coffee [Brewing Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/brewing-coffee/)---by [Michael Allen Smith](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/michael-allen-smith/)![Tips for Quick and Easy Cold Brewed Iced Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/tips-for-quick-and-easy-iced-coffee/toddy-cold-brew-system.jpg) Summertime is the perfect time for iced coffee. How do you make it at home? There are two schools of thought. One is to make a near double-strength cup of hot coffee and then chill it with ice. This is pretty easy but not very quick, especially if you make drinks for others and yourself during a hot day. And who wants to sit inside brewing coffee when you could be out by the pool or playing volleyball? Not me. The second and superior method is to make a coffee concentrate. This method is quick and easy. The most popular cold coffee concentrate brewing system is the Toddy Coffee Maker. Basically, you let the coffee steep at room temperature overnight while you are sleeping, and then it gets moved to the refrigerator. Once cold, you can pour yourself coffee whenever you desire. Add some ice and a splash of water or cream, and you’re done.![Toddy Cold Brew System](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/toddy-cold-brew-system.JlC0DEXE_RdeHX.webp) In the article [Cold Brew Coffee with the Toddy Coffee Maker](https://ineedcoffee.com/cold-brew-coffee-with-the-toddy-coffee-maker/), I listed a few reasons for using this coffee brewing method. They include: 1. Less acid than other coffee brewing methods. 2. 33% less caffeine. 3. Perfect for households where people drink coffee at different times of the day. 4. Camping. 5. **Iced coffee!**6. Power Outage. _(I wrote this after experiencing a San Diego summer blackout)_### Brewing Overview For the Toddy Coffee Maker Refer to the Toddy Coffee Brewing Tutorial for more details and photos on using the Toddy Coffee maker. Here is a brief overview of how easy it is to make coffee concentrate. 1. Flip the Toddy Upside down and secure the stopper into the brewing container. 2. Wet it and insert the circular filter into the bottom of the toddler. 3. Add one pound of medium (drip) ground coffee into the brewer. 4. Slowly and evenly add 4 cups of cold water. Do not stir. 5. Wait 5 minutes, and then add five more cups of cold water. Again, do not stir. 6. Cover with a plate or plastic wrap. This will keep insects or dust from falling into your coffee. 7. Let the coffee brew for 10-12 hours at room temperature. 8. Release coffee into the glass decanter. 9. It can take 20-30 minutes for the coffee to drain. 10. Place into the refrigerator. That is it. Although I am a big fan of grinding my own beans, grinding a whole pound at once is time-consuming. This is one brewing method where I am OK with having your beans ground at the coffee roaster. Just make sure you start the brewing that evening. ### Making an Iced Toddy Coffee The title of this article makes it clear that easy is essential to good iced coffee. Since you’ve made the concentrate already, making the Iced Toddy Coffee is straightforward 1. Add ice to the glass 2. Pour in coffee concentrate. 3. Add water or milk to get your preferred level of strength. 4. (optional) Add sweeteners. 5. (optional) Top with a creamy alcoholic drink such as Baileys or Kahlua. ### Resources [Cold Brew Coffee with the Toddy Coffee Maker](https://ineedcoffee.com/cold-brew-coffee-with-the-toddy-coffee-maker/) – Cold brewing coffee tutorial.

This recipe will help you make your own at home.![tiramisu finished](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/tiramisu-finished1.gwlW3Kdb_Z2Kd1m.webp)_Espresso Tiramisu_ Ingredients: (Makes enough for 16 people) - 12 shots of espresso - 5 shots of Chocolate liqueur (ex: Godiva brand) - 1/2 shot of Rum - 2 shots of coffee liqueur (ex: Kahlua brand) - 6 eggs - 48 ladyfingers (usually two packages) - 16 oz. of mascarpone cheese (usually two packages) - 6 oz powdered chocolate - 1/2 cup of bittersweet chocolate chips - 2 tablespoons of milk - Whipped cream in a can for garnish This recipe makes a **huge amount of tiramisu**: probably enough for 16 if they exercise portion control. (But good luck with that once they taste this stuff!) If you aren’t making this for an event or large gathering, you can half the recipe and probably be just fine.![tiramisu ingredients](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/tiramisu-ingredients.CvqyvaZo_1efNWA.webp)_Tiramisu Ingredients_### Step-by-step Make the Liquid Mixture Pull the shots of coffee, add the rum, coffee liqueur, and three shots of chocolate liqueur. Save two shots of the chocolate liqueur for later. Set the liquids over to the side. ### Make the Mascarpone Filling Separate the egg yolks from the egg whites. The egg yolks should be mixed with the remaining chocolate liqueur and the sugar. Put the egg yolks in a pan that can be placed on top of another to create a “water bath” effect. The lower pan should be filled with water brought to a rolling boil. Constantly stir the egg yolk/chocolate liqueur mixture while it is heated. Heat for about three minutes until the mixture is light and bubbly.![tiramisu stovetop](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/tiramisu-stovetop.BDxxEp_j_1eJwWq.webp)![tiramisu mixer](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/tiramisu-mixer.DmpsYP0V_Z1ygGFS.webp) Take the mixture off the heat and immediately mix it with the mascarpone. Use an electric mixer to blend thoroughly.![tiramisu fluffy](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/tiramisu-fluffy.TeutybBZ_1EYRcf.webp)_Beat Egg Whites_ In a separate bowl, beat the egg whites until they are at stiff peaks. Fold the egg whites into the mascarpone mixture. ### Chocolate Drizzle In a small glass bowl, pour in most of the chocolate chips (save some for a garnish). Add the milk and microwave for about one minute until melted. Stir and set to the side. Begin the layering process: Dunk the ladyfingers in the liquid mixture one at a time, ensuring that each receives an equal amount of liquid. Layer them along the bottom of the trifle bowl. Spread approximately half of the filling on top of the ladyfingers. Sprinkle powdered chocolate over this, then drizzle the liquid chocolate over this. Repeat for the second layer. ### Refrigerate Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 12 hours. ### Final touches You can garnish with whipped cream and chocolate chips. You may also want to cut up the tiramisu and garnish each plate separately. Published on December 28, 2016--- #### Lura Lee Lura Lee enjoys coffee, but no longer pursues coffee as a hobby.

# Toasted Mate and Rooibos [Tea](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/tea/)---by [Rudolf Guild](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/rudolf-guild/)![Toasted Mate and Rooibos](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/toasted-mate-and-rooibos/roobios-tea.jpg) I’m something of a beverage fanatic. I just finished off a pot of Dragon Well green tea. I’ve got a freshly roasted batch of Puerto Rican coffee here. I will drink some tomorrow, even though I should probably let it sit longer. But even though my cupboard is largely dedicated to green tea and coffee, there’s a shelf dedicated to herbal teas. I think it’s fun to occasionally take a break from our preferred caffeinated beverages to explore some wildly different flavors. That’s why I’ve selected two herbal teas I think even the most dedicated coffee fiend will enjoy. The history of these sorts of drinks is almost always the same — European settlers, finding importing coffee and tea to be prohibitively expensive, try a sip of what the natives are drinking, and the rest is history. ### Toasted Mate Yerba mate is a holly plant that’s been in use for centuries in Latin America. It serves basically the same purpose as coffee in Latin American culture. Interestingly, not only does it contain a pretty high dose of caffeine, but it also contains other xanthines, theobromine, and theophylline, which are found in coffee, chocolate, and tea. Here’s an infusion that will give you the same kick you get from coffee. “But it tastes like grass!” you’re probably thinking right about now. That’s where toasted mate comes in. Now, the leaves of a plant can’t undergo quite the same involved roasting process as coffee — not unless you want tea made of ash — but yerba mate branches can be smoked over an open fire to create “toasted” or “roasted” mate. The result is a dark drink that recaptures some of the smoky notes of coffee while adding its own twist. Yerba mate should be brewed like tea: steeped in near-boiling (not boiling!) water for 3 to 5 minutes.![Yerba Mate](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/yerba-mate1.qTsfz-Bh_ZgjF6i.webp)_Yerba mate in a gourd by [Beatrice Murch](http://www.flickr.com/photos/blmurch/306252048/in/photostream/), used under the [Creative Commons license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/deed.en)_### Rooibos Nothing quite comes close to having a shot of espresso or a cup of cappuccino with dessert. The flavor mixes perfectly with nearly anything — creme Brule, cake, bananas foster. But here’s the problem: you’ve got work in the morning, and you can’t afford to be wide awake for the next 5 hours. Instead of reaching for a cup of decaf (blech), why not try some red espresso? Red espresso is a finely ground variant of rooibos, a legume of all things that is harvested in South Africa. Rooibos has a sweet and earthy flavor. Compared to coffee and tea, it has very few tannins and won’t become bitter, even for those of you who leave a brew standing for hours (you know who you are). Red espresso can make a rooibos equivalent of any coffee drink.![](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/red-tea.Bmp_x3CO_FRHq9.webp) Whether you’re looking for something new or just need a caffeine-free coffee substitute, I hope you give these two unique drinks a try. ### Resources [Herbal Tea Source](http://web.archive.org/web/20141217052242/http://herbalteasource.com/) – Web resource dedicated to herbal teas.

# Top 3 Ways to Reuse Your Coffee Grounds [Cafe Culture](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/cafe-culture/)---by [James Grierson](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/james-grierson/)![Top 3 Ways to Reuse Your Coffee Grounds](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/top-3-ways-to-re-use-your-coffee-grounds/image2-coffee-car.jpg) According to the latest figures from the World Resources Institute, over 7 million tons of coffee are consumed around the world each year. In the UK the average person uses 2.8kg, in the USA 4.2kg, but Finland comes top with a whopping 12kg per person. The consumption of 7 million tons of coffee will produce an estimated 5.6 million tons (dry weight) of coffee grounds for disposal, assuming that 20% is extracted from making each cup of coffee. This is enough waste to fill Wembley Stadium over 140,000 times. This may seem like a large amount of waste. However, coffee decomposes fairly quickly, so the waste should decay to nothing within a year or so. However, before it decomposes, it takes up a lot of room at a landfill, and because of the huge amount of it, it does pose a question: “Isn’t there something better I could be doing with my used coffee grounds?” So here is my list of the top 3 (in no particular order) ways to re-use those grounds: ### #1 On Your Garden Perhaps the easiest and most accessible way to reuse grounds is in your garden. You don’t even need to be a keen gardener; you can get away with just chucking the grounds over your lawn. Coffee makes a good fertilizer for plants as it contains nitrogen. You can sprinkle used grounds around the base of a plant before watering. Or you can make a liquid feed by mixing approximately 10 grams of grounds with every 1 litre of water. Grounds also make a great soil conditioner. A couple of years ago I had a problem with my grass; it had poor drainage and as a result, didn’t look particularly green. So I mixed my use grounds with some horticultural sand and spread this over the grass, leaving it to be mixed in by the rain and the worms. After three months it was looking much better.![Grass before and after coffee grounds](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/image1-grass1.BwXcKsh3_1OaR2C.webp)_Grass before and after coffee grounds._ Coffee can be added to your compost pile as well. You can even add your filter papers too. They both break down fairly quickly. ### #2 As a Fuel The oil in used coffee grounds can be extracted to make biofuel. The University of Nevada, conducted research back in 2008 using leftover coffee grounds from Starbucks. Using a relatively simple technique they were able to extract the oil from the grounds and then convert this into biodiesel. If the entire world’s used coffee was converted like this, it’s estimated that it would produce 340 million gallons of biodiesel per year. Another interesting experiment is the coffee car. It’s a bit similar to the ‘Mr. Fusion’ generator fitted on the Delorean in the movie Back to the Future. However, instead of running on beer and banana skins, it runs on pellets made from compressed coffee grounds.![Coffee Car](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/image2-coffee-car.BifLRd4t_Zyn0uk.webp)_Coffee Car – Picture credit: [BBC](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p006v36s)_ The original coffee-powered car, nicknamed the ‘Car-puccino’, was built in partnership by Martin Bacon (the inventory) and his team, and the BBC; as part of their ‘Bang Goes the Theory’ show. It made the Guinness Book of Records in March 2010 for the longest journey made by a coffee-powered car, when it traveled from London to Manchester. However, it did break down a few times on the way! Last year a Mark II model was made, by just Bacon and his team, with the aim of setting the land speed record for a coffee-powered car. In September 2011, it set a record of 66.5mph! They’re now currently building Mark III, with the aim of traveling over 2,000 miles around the UK. Whilst making your own biofuel or coffee-powered car might be beyond your expertise to create, there is a simpler way to convert spent coffee grounds to fuel: coffee logs. Coffee logs can be used on open fires or in a log burner to help heat your home. I’m wondering whether they could also be used on the barbecue. They might add a unique flavour to your food. There are plenty of recipes on the internet on how to make them. ### #3 As a Building Material Coffee is now being used as a construction material for furniture. A company called Re-Work has developed ‘Curface’ (pronounced surface), a composite material made from used coffee grounds and recycled plastic.![Curface. Picture Credit: Re-Work](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/image3-curface.CuM7qYRB_ZtuJVi.webp)_Curface. Picture Credit: Re-Work (site gone)_ Curface is similar to wood in its uses; it can be sawn and sanded. It also comes in flat sheets like MDF or plywood; so it’s ideal for tabletops and worktops. Unlike wood, it is waterproof, so doesn’t require any further treatment. Not to be left out, kids can do their own coffee-related construction thanks to a Japanese company. Colors Tokyo has made some Lego-like bricks, called ‘Earth Blocks’, out of sawdust, cedar bark shavings, and used tea leaves and coffee grounds. Unfortunately, the bricks are currently only available in four fairly dull colours, and a 50-piece set costs a hefty 30 USD, so I don’t think they’re going to catch on. Still, the thought is there though.![Earth Blocks](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/image4-earth-blocks.DTosYuk7_ZJ5OEu.webp)_Earth Blocks.

# Traditional Chai Tea Recipe [Tea](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/tea/)---by [Alex Lang](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/alex-lang/)![Traditional Chai Tea Recipe](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/traditional-chai-tea-recipe/Traditional-Chai-Tea-Recipe.jpg) You have to try a slice of Key Lime Pie when you’re in Key West. In Maryland, it’s all about crab cakes. And no place owns pizza like New York City does. The flavors, as much as anything else, define a place. In India—a country with more than 1.2 billion people—the drink that helps define its cultural palette is Masala Chai. The name translates to ‘mixed-spice tea’ in English, and that’s the perfect summary. Chai’s rich flavors vary by region, but it always contains four essential ingredients: milk, sugar, cardamom, and ginger.![masala-chai-spices](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/masala-chai-spices650.BBRAc98z_1OSdoi.webp)_Cinnamon, cloves, cardamom, and ginger._ Sold on the streets of India by tea vendors called chai wallahs, its unique notes have won the world over. Now virtually every coffee and tea shop across the globe has its own version of Masala Chai. Despite the complexities of Chai, it’s incredibly easy to make yourself at home, which allows you to tailor the spices to best suit your taste buds. Let’s walk through how to make a traditional Chai. Here’s what you’ll need. ### Ingredients - 4 cups water - 4 teaspoons loose Assam tea - 8 cardamon pods - 4 cloves smashed - 1 cinnamon stick (optional) - 1/2 teaspoon ground ginger - 2 tbsp brown sugar (use 3 if you like it on the sweet side) - 2 cups milk - 1 shot espresso (if you want a ‘dirty’ chai) - First, roughly grind the cardamom, cloves, and cinnamon. A mortar and pestle work best for this, but if you have a coffee grinder handy you can use that, too. Heat the milk in a large pot, bringing it to a simmer and adding the ground spices and brown sugar. Once the sugar has dissolved you can taste and add more if needed. Let it simmer for 3-4 minutes. While the spice mixture cooks, make the tea. If you’re using loose leaf tea, put the leaves in a teapot, then pour 4 cups of hot water over the leaves. If tea bags are easier, that’s great too, you’ll need 4 cups of brewed tea.![assam-tea-leaves](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/assam-tea-leaves650.BU4_Pcac_19JBMi.webp)_Assam Tea Leaves_![brewed-assam-tea](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/brewed-assam-tea650.DAT6nbps_11Jdqy.webp)_Brewed Assam tea_ Once the tea has finished steeping, slowly pour it into the pot of spices, mixing as you go.

[Recipes](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/coffee-recipes/)---by [Holland Morgan](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/holland-morgan/)![Tres Leches Latte or is it Tre Lattes Latte?](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/tres-leches-latte-or-is-it-tre-lattes-latte/tre-leches-latte1.jpg) I recently made a Tres Leches cake for my blog. For those not familiar with Tres Leches, it is a dense sponge cake that has been soaked in a syrupy mixture of evaporated milk, sweetened condensed milk, and heavy cream, hence the name Tres Leches (three kinds of milk). The cake is then topped with whipped cream making it a decadent Latin-American treat. When making this cake it is always assured that you will have leftover milk syrup. Instead of dumping it down the sink, I thought, “why not make coffee with it?” The result was spectacular!![Tres Leches Latte](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/tre-leches-latte1.QYS_gvL3_o9rKn.webp)_Tres Leches Latte_### A Tre Latte Latte! (Italian for Tres Leches Latte) The Tres Leches milk syrup is roughly two parts evaporated milk, two parts sweetened condensed milk, and 1 part heavy cream. Since you will surely want to share it with your friends, the easiest recipe is as follows. Stir together: - 1-14 oz can of evaporated milk - 1-14 oz can of sweetened condensed milk - 1 cup heavy cream For my latte, I started with a 4 oz espresso. Steam: 5 oz milk, 3 oz Tres Leches syrup, and 1/4 tsp vanilla extract. For the really cool layered look first: put the milk in the cup, wait until it’s settled, and then add the espresso very slowly. It will automatically separate. Don’t even try to count the calories!

# Troubleshooting French Press Coffee [Brewing Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/brewing-coffee/)---by [Michael Allen Smith](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/michael-allen-smith/)![Troubleshooting French Press Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/troubleshooting-french-press-coffee/troubleshooting-french-press-coffee.jpg) This article expands the troubleshooting table inside the [French Press Coffee Tutorial](https://ineedcoffee.com/press-pot-tutorial/). I’ve brewed a lot of coffee using the French Press. Along the way, I’ve developed a checklist of steps to improve the taste. Some variables are easy to correct, and some require a little effort. Before you start tweaking, it is important to get the basics correct. **The steps listed below should be followed in sequence.** There is no point in adjusting the grind if your water quality is poor. ### #1 Water Quality There are a few articles on this site that cover water quality. I have a simple rule to measure water quality: Drink the water by itself. Does it taste good? If so, then that is good enough. If the water doesn’t taste right on its own, then your coffee will probably taste off as well. Seek out a good water source before you start to brew your coffee. ### #2 Brewing Temperature When brewing French Press coffee, you want the temperature off a boil. This equates to 195-205 °F or 90.5-96.1 °C. For lighter roasts, aim to be closer to 205°F. For darker roasts, strive for 195°F. A kettle like the Bonavita will let you dial your desired temperature. Not only is that good for coffee, but it is also a [necessity for some teas](https://ineedcoffee.com/a-coffee-lovers-guide-to-tea/). ### #3 Fresh Coffee Coffee is a perishable item. As it ages, it loses flavor. How much flavor loss is acceptable is up to you. I used to only drink coffee that was less than 10 days old, but in recent years, I’ve been surprised by some lighter-roasted coffee that still tasted very good weeks after roast. A general rule is that the darker the coffee is roasted, the shorter the window of freshness will be. A light Scandinavian roast might stay flavorful for more than four weeks, whereas a dark French roast could begin to go stale less than one week after roasting. For a more detailed discussion on this topic, see our article [Hacking Dark Roast—Tips on Brewing a Better Bold Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/hacking-dark-roast-tips-on-brewing-a-better-bold-coffee/). If you don’t [roast your own coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/why-home-roast/), then look for a roasted date on the bag of coffee before purchasing. Grocery stores are notorious for putting stale coffee in front of fresh bags. Just dig deeper into the pile looking for a fresher date. If a roaster doesn’t put a roasted date on the bag, I assume they are hiding something and the coffee is stale. As you attempt to make a perfect cup of French Press coffee, you’ll want to eliminate as many variables as possible. Having a high-quality fresh coffee to work with will increase your odds of success. ### #4 Grind Size A French Press uses a coarser grind than drip coffee. If the grind is too fine, the coffee will taste bitter. If the grind is too coarse, the coffee could taste weak. When it comes to grinding, a coffee drinker has two choices. You can have it ground at the time of purchase using a commercial-grade grinder or grind it yourself. Having it ground at the roaster or grocery store will guarantee that the size is perfect; however, the flavor compounds in the coffee will start breaking down immediately. You’ll be trading a bitter coffee for a stale coffee. In other words, ideally, you’ll want to get a grinder. Once you have your grinder, dialing in the perfect grind takes just a little practice.![French Press Grind by US nickel](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/2-french-press-grind.UpzKzpJV_Z72YY4.webp)_Coarse [Coffee Grind](https://ineedcoffee.com/coffee-grind-chart/) is most commonly used for French Press coffee. Some coffee drinkers will prefer it a little finer, but this is a good starting point._### #5 Steep Time The most common steep time recommended for French Press coffee is 4 minutes. I have talked with many coffee professionals, and the time they use them varies from 3 to 6 minutes. After brewing thousands of pots of press pot coffee, my recommended time is 3 ½ minutes. In my opinion, the coffee tastes brighter and more flavorful at the lower end. I’ve found that the longer the steeping time, the more the body takes over the flavor. I’m in the minority on this topic, so this will require your own experimentation. Another opinion is to adjust the steeping time based on the actual coffee. If you want to highlight the bright flavors, do a 3 ½ minute steep. If you want to develop a richer body, add an extra minute. ### #6 Dosage Getting the dosage correct is the last step because the other steps tend to have more fixed rules. Although there is a recommended dosage, it will be a personal choice. The debates over water quality, coffee freshness, grind size, and brewing temperature are over. Steep time has a sliding window of +/—60 seconds. So, the only real variable left is the dosage. The reason dosage can be tricky is that people new to press pot coffee will often perceive the taste as “too strong.” French press coffee is supposed to taste richer. If that richness comes off as being “too strong,” then those new to press pot coffee may experiment with a lower dosage and then gradually move the dosage in line with standard recommendations over time. But you don’t want to go too low, or the coffee will taste bitter. What is the dose? According to Bodum, the most popular French Press coffee maker manufacturer, for each 4 oz. cup (1.25 deciliter), put one rounded tablespoon of coarse-ground coffee into the pot. I advise starting with this dose and then adjusting it up or down. Another dosage option is to weigh the beans using a kitchen scale. The common ratios used are covered in the [French Press Coffee Tutorial](https://ineedcoffee.com/press-pot-tutorial/).![coffee 17:1 brew ratio](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/coffee-dosage-chart.B2CLxO_e_ZtMYQv.webp)_The coffee dosage chart photo was taken at Batdorf and Bronson in Olympia, WA._### #7 Slow Press or Scrape For a Cleaner Cup of Coffee There will be coffee sediment in a mug of French press coffee. When the first version of this article was written, my only advice was to make sure the filter had a snug fit and then avoid drinking the last mouthful from each mug. Then I learned this trick from barista Christos Andrews. Thirty seconds before the steep ends, slowly press down the French Press plunger. It should move so slowly that it takes a full 30 seconds till it hits the bottom. This gentle press method results in a cleaner cup of coffee. Another tip for a cleaner cup is to scrape some or all of the coffee grounds from the top of the French Press before pressing down. Using a large spoon or two, remove the grounds on the top. Then, proceed to press the filter down. This does require more work, but I have noticed that the coffee’s flavor is brighter using this method. The downside is that the scraping method might make the coffee taste too clean or weak. I prefer the slow press technique over scraping, but you could use both. ### #8 Time to Buy a New French Press? If you have tried all the steps above and your coffee still doesn’t taste good enough, the filter may no longer fit tightly enough on the French Press. The filter can become loose or even bent. If it is time to replace your French Press, check out our guide [Buying a French Press – Picking the Right One](https://ineedcoffee.com/buying-a-french-press-picking-the-right-one/). ### #9 Time to Try Another Brewing Method? After all these steps, you may discover that you just don’t like the taste of French Press coffee. If you like the richness but want something cleaner, look into the [Clever Coffee Dripper](https://ineedcoffee.com/clever-coffee-dripper-review/) or the [Bonavita Immersion Coffee Dripper](https://ineedcoffee.com/step-step-bonavita-immersion-coffee-dripper-tutorial/).![Clever Coffee - Add Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/ccd-2.wY5P0-OJ_ZX95JN.webp) *Clever Coffee Dripper *### Last Words You may like certain coffee types more than others in a French Press. Experiment. I don’t like anything dark-roasted in a French Press. Brighter coffees from East Africa or Central America excel in the press pot. Good luck with your French Press brewing. ### Resources [Buying a French Press – Picking the Right One](https://ineedcoffee.com/buying-a-french-press-picking-the-right-one/) – A guide to help you decide which French Press coffee brewer is best for you.

# Top 10 Signs of a Good Coffee House [Coffee Business](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/coffee-business/)---by [Chris Arnold](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/chris-arnold/)![Top 10 Signs of a Good Coffee House](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/top-10-signs-of-a-good-coffee-house/latte-art-esquires1.jpg)**1. Cleanliness.** Look at things like the steam wand, the espresso machine, and the counters. A meticulously clean coffeehouse probably means people care about other things, such as keeping cockroach colonies to a minimum.**2. Staff.** Consistently friendly, happy staff will probably put that same energy into your drinks. At the very least, it makes you feel good after dropping $3.75 on 2 ounces of espresso, right?**3. Crowds.** If you see many people, this could be a good sign. (OK, Starbucks might be the exception). Not that Starbucks has bad coffee…**4. Roasting.** A coffeehouse that roasts its own coffee (especially on-premises) at least means you have a good shot at fresh beans. They may roast too dark, but it is a start. You may even be able to sweet-talk the owner or roaster into going a little lighter. Tread Lightly Here.**5. Menu.** If there is more coffee on the menu than other stuff, you are on the right track. Test the waters; buy a cup, but don’t tip for now. If they have 12 different sandwiches, and 7 coffee drinks, spit that tuna salad sandwich out and remove them from your little black book.**6. Drip Coffee.** Frequent brewing and digital timers on the air-pots are a good sign. Several selections can be good too. Look for a changing palate of selections, and if there are more flavored coffees than single origins or blends, you may be in trouble. Another bad sign is a bunch of blends, and never the mention of a Kenya AA, Guatemala Antigua, or Ethiopian Harrar. True coffee aficionados know their regions.**7. Espresso.** If it looks like they actually dose and tamp, and time the shots properly, they may actually know what they are doing. If you see an 11-second shot, run away and grab a couple of bucks out of the tip jar on the way out. Ski mask optional.**8. Latte.** If you order a Latte drink, and they do Latte art, you have probably found _the_ place. It is not easy to do, and it shows the Barista cares very much about your washtub of milk with coffee.![latte art esquires](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/latte-art-esquires1.BkplhxTB_Z1gaFB8.webp)**9. French Press.** If they even offer French Press, you are probably in a cool place. If they grind to the correct coarseness and don’t give you boiling water, you may be in coffee heaven. OK, not heaven, but you are certainly on your way out of purgatory.**10. Barista Training.** This might require some inquiry. But if the owner puts his Barista through training (and it will show), that means he cares deeply about your needs. In a platonic way of course. Remember, the best espresso served by a rude Barista is no fun. Neither is a paper cup full of burnt crap served by the most pleasant Barista. And forget about sandwiches and pastries. Remember, you are going to a _**Coffee** House_. Published on August 1, 2007--- #### Chris Arnold Chris is the creator of Two Bit History.

# Top 7 Health Benefits of Drinking Coffee [Coffee and Health](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/coffee-health/)---by [Ran Nir](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/ran-nir/)![Top 7 Health Benefits of Drinking Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/top-7-health-benefits-of-drinking-coffee/heart.jpg) Are you trying to cut back on coffee for fear it might damage your health? Well, you’ll be pleased to hear that coffee has many health benefits. There may be no need to give it up – in fact, you might be able to start drinking more. See below for our top 7 benefits of drinking coffee. ### #1 Excellent source of antioxidants Did you know that coffee contains more antioxidants than green tea and cocoa? According to scientific research, around 1,000 antioxidants have been found in unprocessed coffee beans [1], and it is believed that even more develop during the roasting process. If you want to target free radicals, drinking coffee is one way to do it. ### #2 Good for the heart A Dutch study found that moderate coffee drinkers (those who consume two to four cups a day) have a 20% lower risk of heart disease than heavy coffee drinkers, light coffee drinkers, and non-coffee drinkers. The study analyzed the data from more than 37,000 over thirteen years to get the results [2]. There is some evidence that coffee is good for the heart, as it protects against arterial damage caused by inflammation. One reason to suggest it promotes good heart health is that it contains chlorogenic acid, an important antioxidant that fights against cardiovascular disease.![heart](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/heart.CRgQPc3j_ZHq5wo.webp)_[Photo](https://www.flickr.com/photos/evablue/4583830419/) by Eva Blue_### #3 Helps to prevent depression Numerous studies have linked coffee with lower rates of depression in both men and women. Results found that heavy coffee drinkers had the lowest risk of getting depression [3]. Whilst researchers aren’t sure how coffee curbs depression, it is thought to have to do with the fact that caffeine activates neurotransmitters in the brain, which are responsible for controlling mood. ### #4 Your Liver Loves it Coffee consumption has been linked to lowering the risk of liver cancer and cirrhosis, particularly alcoholic cirrhosis. A study in the Archives of Internal Medicine [4] showed a correlation between increased coffee consumption and decreased risk of cirrhosis. ### #5 Lower risk of getting cancer According to several studies, men who drink coffee could be at a lower risk of developing aggressive prostate cancer. Research from the Harvard School of Public Health has also suggested that drinking four or more cups of coffee daily will decrease the risk of endometrial cancer in women by up to 25% [5]. In addition to this, researchers have found a link between regular coffee drinking and lower rates of liver, colon, breast, and rectal cancers. Again, it is thought to be related to the antioxidants in coffee. ### #6 Good for the brain Coffee is said to temporarily boost brain activity and give short-term memory boosts. Studies have also suggested that it could help prevent cognitive decline associated with diseases like Alzheimer’s and Dementia. A Finnish study found that drinking three to five cups of coffee daily at midlife age could result in a 65% decreased risk of Alzheimer’s and dementia later in life [6]. Some believe this is down to the caffeine in coffee, which prevents the build-up of beta-amyloid plaque, something that could contribute to Alzheimer’s disease.![coffee planet shaking](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/coffee-planet-shaking1.M68_ViIq_Z2in6nO.webp) ### #7 Lessens the risk of Type 2 Diabetes A number of different research projects have suggested that coffee drinking is linked to a reduced risk of Type 2 Diabetes. In 2009, a study found that the risk of developing Type 2 Diabetes dropped by 7% for each daily cup of coffee [7]. Other studies have found that heavy coffee drinkers (those who consume more than four cups a day) had a 50% lower risk of developing Type 2 Diabetes. Scientists believe that drinking coffee prevents Diabetes by helping the body use insulin and ensuring the effective regulation of blood sugar. It is also thought to prevent tissue damage and battle inflammation. Although you may be drinking coffee for pleasure, it’s great to know that it has so many health benefits, too! ### References [1] [http://www.coffeeandhealth.ca/antioxidants.htm](http://web.archive.org/web/20111113134348/http://www.coffeeandhealth.ca:80/antioxidants.htm) [2] [http://www.nhs.uk/news/2010/06June/Pages/tea-and-coffee-good-for-heart.aspx](https://web.archive.org/web/20201230104525/https://www.nhs.uk/news/food-and-diet/a-hearty-cup-of-tea/) [3] [http://www.npr.org/blogs/thesalt/2011/09/27/140837983/caffeinated-women-may-be-fighting-depression-with-every-cup](https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2011/09/27/140837983/caffeinated-women-may-be-fighting-depression-with-every-cup) [4] [http://archinte.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=410422](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/410422) [5] [http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/news/hsph-in-the-news/coffee-endometrial-cancer-risk/](http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/news/hsph-in-the-news/coffee-endometrial-cancer-risk/) (MARCH 2025: link offline) [6] [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20182054](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20182054/) [7] [http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/healthy-drinks/other-healthy-beverage-options/](https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/healthy-drinks/other-healthy-beverage-options/) Published on May 28, 2015--- #### Ran Nir Doppio Coffee is a coffee wholesale company that aims to build a bridge between roasters, coffee equipment manufacturers, and independent coffee shops.

# UniTerra Nomad Espresso Machine Review [Espresso](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/espresso/)---by [Chris Arnold](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/chris-arnold/)![UniTerra Nomad Espresso Machine Review](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/uniterra-nomad-espresso-machine-review/DSC01513.jpg) There are quite a number of handheld espresso makers, mainly targeted at campers, backpackers, and ultra-light road warriors. The Nomad by UniTerra is similar in that it is hand-operated and requires no electricity, but it comes in a larger but still portable form factor. It seems more appropriate for a picnic, road trip, vacation home, dorm, office, or even your primary residence. The question with all hand-powered espresso makers remains the same: How good is the espresso compared to their electric-powered counterparts? Read on to find out.![Nomad Espresso Machine](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/DSC01509-650x433.6hb72Hw2_2bwVLl.webp) ### Nomad Espresso Machine by UniTerra The Nomad is an oddly beautiful looking device with strange geometric angles and lines, and yet it looks like a small piece of art that anyone would be proud to display. Mine is a gorgeous Cobalt Blue with matte silver accents. It is also available in a Luminescent Green color. The Nomad is made up of the main base unit and attached pump lever, a built-in water tank and removable cap, and filter assembly (coffee drawer, brew box, and basket). Nomad also includes very detailed printed instructions and a tamper.![Nomad Espresso Machine](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/DSC01512-501x650.DICEMm4K_Z3pFCX.webp) The build quality is simply excellent. The fit and finish are probably the best in just about any coffee product I have reviewed over the years, including the $2000+ prosumer Italian espresso machines I have purchased on my own.  The unit is designed in the USA and made in Taiwan. One of the unique features of the Nomad Espresso Machine is what they call the True Crema Valve, or TCV. It claims to compensate for tamping and [grind level](https://ineedcoffee.com/coffee-grind-chart/) variations. They even say that you can use pre-ground coffee from the store or ground beans from a whirly blade grinder and still get excellent results. The TCV can be removed, which then means the ground and tamp become more critical, just like an unforgiving espresso machine. I did not experiment with a poor grind nor did I remove the TCV. I might do this in the future to compare and understand the capabilities and limitations.![Nomad Espresso True Crema Valve](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/DSC01526-650x433.2c4yivuy_1SE5cm.webp)_Patented True Crema Valve (TCV)_ Making a shot of espresso is relatively straightforward. It starts with filling the water reservoir with about 7oz (200cc) of boiling water, and filling the basket with finely ground coffee and tamping. It is then recommended to pump about 12 times for pre-infusion and then wait a few seconds. Then you pump until you are in the green zone indicated on the pressure gauge. Now you just pump the seesaw lever fast or slow enough to keep it in the correct range until your espresso is done.![Nomad Espresso Machine](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/DSC01518-586x650.fV5NUXAJ_8UVzA.webp)_A seesaw lever that operates dual pistons_![Nomad Espresso Machine](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/DSC01515-650x455.Bsdrem2i_3lKuP.webp)_Pressure Gauge showing the Optimal “Crema” Zone_### Impressions I experimented with a Brazil, about 5 days off the roast. At first, I used a grind level that I had set up for my Izzo Alex Duetto III and didn’t fill the basket fully. The crema was good, and the flavor was nice. I then adjusted the grind finer and filled the basket to the max. The result was even more crema and flavor. It was very close to the Alex, and in some ways was smoother. I was really impressed with the flavor, and ease of repeatability.![Espresso Shot from the Nomad](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/DSC01521-525x650.CLylg6k3_ZLLO0L.webp)_First, using a coarser grind and less coffee. The results were good._![Espresso Shot from the Nomad](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/DSC01524-518x650.CjsAwZCk_H270z.webp)_Second, using a finer grind and more coffee. The results were excellent._ Because the filter assembly has several pieces, cleanup requires running water. So, if you need to serve several espressos out in the field, I would recommend extra filter assemblies, which are also available for purchase separately. ### Additional Thoughts There are always a few things that could be improved with all products. I would like to see all of these things improved on V2, but none are showstoppers that would keep me from purchasing the current generation of the Nomad. I found that the fill spout was placed a little low, which made it awkward to fill, so I would like to see a slightly higher fill spout. There are times when you end up using your palms to maintain the proper pressure on the seesaw lever, and it would be nice to see a little more comfortable shape at the ends. My Illy cappuccino cup barely fits under the machine, actually lifting the machine up just a bit. I would like to see more clearance for taller cups.![Nomad Espresso Machine](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/DSC01520-529x650.BtAPCMjT_2kRW3S.webp) ### Conclusion At just under $300, the Nomad is by no means inexpensive. However, I would say its flavor and crema rival more expensive electric-powered espresso machines, so in that sense, I consider it a bargain. Electric-powered espresso machines can also use a lot of electricity, so this could go a long way toward lowering your electricity bill and potentially your carbon footprint. You also have something portable, which greatly increases versatility. Add to that a very strong aesthetic quality, and just about anyone would be proud to leave this out on the kitchen counter or office desk.  The Nomad is highly recommended. ### Resources [Battle of the Handheld Espresso Makers: Handpresso Wild Hybrid vs Wacaco Minipresso GR](https://ineedcoffee.com/battle-handheld-espresso-makers-handpresso-wild-hybrid-vs-wacaco-minipresso-gr/) – Overview of two handheld espresso makers._Disclosure: INeedCoffee was sent this product at no cost, which did not affect its review._ Published on April 4, 2016--- #### Chris Arnold Chris is the creator of Two Bit History.

# The Truth About How Major Religions View Coffee [Coffee History](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/coffee-history/)---by [Shaun Pullen](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/shaun-pullen/)![The Truth About How Major Religions View Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/truth-major-religions-view-coffee/god_that_is_good_coffee_header_v2.jpg) The Father, The Son, and The Holy Bean > Black as the devil, hot as hell, pure as an angel, sweet as love. -Charles Maurice de Talleyrand, French Diplomat Have you ever taken a sip of your favorite brew, tilted your head upwards to the heavens, closed your eyes, and exclaimed, “God, that’s good coffee!”? If you have, you are among the millions and millions of people from all faiths and belief systems who only believe in God because of coffee. Take away the miracle of the coffee bean, and these people would either become agnostics or atheists. And all of them would be sleepy. After all, coffee for many people is religion. We worship it in many different forms, and we exult it through rituals and customs; the Grinding of the Bean, the Sacrament of the Pour Over, the Vow of Silence (until you’ve had at least three sips). We proselytize and spread the Good News about the coming of Intelligentsia to our neighborhoods. We share stories about the miracle of the “Ethiopia Kayon Mountain Natural” and the wonders of “Sumatra Boru Batak.” Yet, while we know a lot about coffee, we have virtually no knowledge of how major religions view it. What do our priests and pastors and rabbis and mullahs and gurus think of the beautiful elixir? And do they drink it? History, like Sean Spicer, provides most of the answers.![coffee drinking Islam - men at table](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/god_that_is_good_coffee_Islam.D-Jc3COl_Z1yrqQX.webp) ### Islam Hundreds of years before travel bans and ISIS were invented, coffee became very much in demand in the Arab world. It all started with those surfing Sufis in southern Arabia who started brewing the stuff in the 13th century. Sheik Abu’l Hasan ‘Ali ibn Umar, or “Skippy” to his friends, traveled to Ethiopia and discovered the coffee culture there, so he decided to bring it back home to Yemen. Because it provided “wakefulness” during late evening prayer, coffee became very popular. “Allah Akhbar! We love our coffee!” Soon after, even without social media, the word spread throughout the Islamic world, and qahwa was consumed everywhere, even at the holiest mosques in Mecca. It was affectionately known as “Islamic wine.” The southern Arabian climate was perfect for coffee cultivation, and the ports of Yemen became the world’s primary exporters of coffee. Many fortunes were made from coffee exports, wealth that rivaled the money made by Howard Schultz. (It’s rumored, by me, that the star in Starbucks is a tribute to the Islamic star.) Mystic theologian and coffee-phile Shaikh ibn Isma’il Ba Alawi of Al-Shihr, or “Shorty” as his friends called him, asserted that the use of coffee before prayer could lead to the experience of qahwa ma’nawiyya or “one kick-ass trippy spiritual experience.” Traders, pilgrims, and students traveled throughout the region extolling the virtues of drinking coffee and, sure enough, coffee houses sprung up in the entire major cities, especially Cairo. Unfortunately, few of them offered free WiFi. However, not everyone embraced bean juice, and throughout the later centuries in the Arab world, there were attempts to make verboten coffee. Those efforts were usually thwarted, however, because even religious leaders were hooked. Coffee prevailed. Praise Allah!![Judaism coffee - man reading ](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/god_that_is_good_coffee_judaism.BI5ua-j3_Z2h2NYl.webp) ### Judaism The relationship between coffee and Judaism runs deep and often parallels what was happening in the Arab world. Religious devotion drove its initial popularity; the later you could stay awake, the more you could tell God that you like him a lot. And because it’s deemed “kosher” (unless your coffee has chunks of pork swimming in it), coffee became popular with the Jews in cities like Damascus, Cairo, and Constantinople. (FYI: Now it’s Istanbul, not Constantinople.) In fact, the first coffee house opened in Constantinople much to the delight of the He-Brews (sorry, I couldn’t help myself). In 1632, it was a Jewish man who opened the first coffee house in Europe, in Livorno, Italy. Eighteen years later, a Sephardic Jew, charmingly called “Jacob the Jew,” founded the first coffee house in Oxford, England. Many Sephardic Jews became coffee traders during this period and brought the idea of coffee houses to France and the Netherlands. Of course, where Jews prosper, antisemitism rears its ugly head. In Germany (surprise!), there were attempts to close down the Jewish coffee trade because coffee was threatening their beer industry. But coffee, as it always does, prevailed. By the 1800s, coffee houses in Berlin, Vienna, Budapest, and Prague were at the forefront of social change. Vienna’s café culture flourished as Jewish scholars, writers, and artists would order their coffees, sit down, and talk politics, literature, and a hundred other topics for hours. The coffee house was the place to be seen and heard. In 19th century America, Jewish traders began operating from seaport cities such as San Francisco, New Orleans, and New York. The New York market was very particularly competitive, and fortunes were made by men such as Samuel Schonbrunn who produced the high-quality Savarin brand served at the Waldorf-Astoria, and William Black, whose nuts shops became Chock Full o’ Nuts coffee shops. Today, the aforementioned Howard Schultz carries on the great Jewish tradition of the coffee house with his 20,737 stores in 63 countries and territories. Oy gevalt!![boy reading Bible on bed](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/god_that_is_good_coffee_christianity.xoNLYWkb_yHeUU.webp) ### Christianity Coffee and Christianity. A match made in Heaven. Exclamations like “Jesus Christ, this coffee is great!” can be heard in all parts of the world every single day. Biblical scholars know that Jesus never drank a cup of coffee himself, but there is speculation that he did foresee its power during his Sermon on the Mount when he said, “Blessed are the sleepless for they have drunk from the cup of Joseph.” Could ‘cuppa Joe’ be far behind? If you’ve ever gone to church or church meetings, coffee looms essential. After services, groups of worshippers often gather in church basements to enjoy a cuppa. While most Evangelicals frown upon liquor, Baptists, Methodists, and Lex Lutherans can all agree that coffee is a true blessing. However, the road to caffeinated bliss was oft-times bumpy. Back in the 16th century, a group of java-hating priests petitioned Pope Clement VIII to ban what they called “the devil’s drink.” the ‘devil’ part a slap in the face to all Muslims. “Not so fast,” proclaimed the Pope. So, he had a cup of coffee brought to him. After his seventh cup and a Danish, old Clement leaped out of his Pope chair and exclaimed, “Why, this Satan’s drink is so delicious that it would be a pity to let the infidels have exclusive use of it. We shall cheat Satan by baptizing it.”(true story) And, for coffee drinkers, it just kept getting better. Here’s an anecdote I found: In 1683, a Franciscan friar named Marciano d’Aviano stopped a Turkish invasion of Austria, and along the way, some claim invented the cappuccino. The retreating Turks left behind bags of coffee beans, historians say, which the Viennese found so bitter that they added milk and sugar, creating a frothy, sweet beverage. Legend says the word “cappuccino” comes from d’Aviano’s Capuchin order, so named for their brown robes. Ergo, the word “Frappuccino” must be named after Capuchin friars.![coffee Mormon - sitting at table ](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/god_that_is_good_coffee_mormonism.CFICH_He_Z2hLLsL.webp) ### Mormonism Mormons don’t drink coffee. This topic is covered in greater detail in the INeedCoffee article [Why Mormons Don’t Drink Coffee or Tea](https://ineedcoffee.com/why-mormons-dont-drink-coffee-or-tea/).![Pope statue ](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/god_that_is_good_coffee_ending.DW72ez4C_Z1HKLCI.webp) ### Religion and Coffee As you can see, religion and coffee go together like soup and a sandwich. Except, we’re talking about coffee. So, the next time you have a religious experience while drinking your favorite brew, think of the history that went into it. If not for some adventurous Sufi guy back in the 13th century, you might be sitting there sipping a warm cup of… tea. Heaven forbid! ### Resources [Coffee: The Wine of Islam](https://superluminal.com/cookbook/essay_coffee.html) – by Kathleen Seidel [The Stimulating Story of Jews and Coffee](https://web.archive.org/web/20210517050038/https://momentmag.com/the-stimulating-story-of-jews-and-coffee/) – by Eileen Lavine [Father, Son and Holy Roast: How coffee became Christians’ acceptable vice](https://web.archive.org/web/20210927020522/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/acts-of-faith/wp/2015/04/02/father-son-and-holy-roast-how-coffee-became-christians-acceptable-vice/) – by Laura Turner_Photos courtesy of Free Range Stock_ Published on June 12, 2021--- #### Shaun Pullen Shaun Pullen shows aspiring coffee enthusiast simple, practical steps for improving their coffee brewing techniques.

# Trey Anastasio: Coffee Achiever [Coffee People](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/coffee-people/)---by [Alex Scofield](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/alex-scofield/)![Trey Anastasio: Coffee Achiever](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/trey-anastasio-coffee-achiever/Trey_Anastasio_singing.jpg) A handful of professional athletes can claim to have done what Phish did musically – quit on their terms while on top. John Elway’s entire football career seemed destined to become a refrain of “could have beens” until he capped his sixteen-year NFL career by leading the Denver Broncos to back-to-back Super Bowl victories, then retired a champion. Longtime Boston Bruin Ray Bourque was traded to the Colorado Avalanche late in the 2000 NHL season, played a vital role in Colorado’s 2001 Stanley Cup crusade, and then retired a champion. In the musical world, Phish did the equivalent in October 2000. In the previous year, the band drew over 80,000 to an Indian reservation in Florida, for the highest-grossing millennial New Year’s Eve concert. Their CD release _Farmhouse_ boasted some well-written and very jammable concert favorites, and their inventory of concert songs ran wider and deeper than ever before. At the height of their concert success, though, the band mutually agreed to take an “indefinite hiatus” at the end of their fall tour. They made good on their word. The end of the road came in Mountain View, California, where Phish played two stellar shows, capped them with an encore of their all-time show-stopper concert song, “You Enjoy Myself”, and walked away, leaving it up in the air if or when they would ever play another concert again.![Trey Anastasio singing](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/Trey_Anastasio_singing-650x488.DxN_1sC1_1vkss4.webp)_Trey Anastasio singing_ When relationships run their course, some people show an ability to rebound to the next thing without skipping a beat, and Trey Anastasio, formerly Phish’s guitarist and musical quarterback, seems like such a person. He was already looking ahead to the “sabbatical” as the 2000 tours progressed, informing Entertainment Weekly that his plans for Phish’s sabbatical included “Sitting at the piano, drinking coffee, and writing, occasionally getting up to cook.” Much of this itinerary is to be taken with a grain of salt — contrary to the sedentary bliss he described, Trey has spent 2001 working with the Vermont Youth Orchestra, touring with a new “solo” band in the spring and summer, and touring again with Oysterhead, a power trio that also includes Les Claypool of Primus and Stuart Copeland of the Police. We can take his stated ambitions to drink coffee more literally — throughout his ascent with Phish, Anastasio has repeatedly shown that he is a certified coffee lover. In a year in which he left the safety of a band that put him on the musical map, it seems clear that Trey gets by with a little help from his friend Coffee which gives him a push forward and onward as it does for so many of us. ### Living on the jam, jamming on the coffee Not everybody has a taste for jamming, improvised music. Somebody who loves the symphony orchestra rightfully expects the musicians to play pieces they have rehearsed thoroughly, and while a fine-tuned ear can appreciate the excellence of individual performances amidst the symphony of sound, or recognize a stellar performance of a piece, an orchestra is not generally expected to meander very far from its compositional structure. In popular music, concert expectations are often similar. Many people who have paid their hard-earned $50 plus $10 TicketMaster “service fee” want a flawless, rigidly scripted product. The Rolling Stones, Jimmy Buffet, Madonna, and U2 generally tour with an unchanging setlist, with solos, choreography, and stage pyrotechnics that were laid out long before they reached your hometown. Most people at the pavilion want exactly that. And then there are the rest of us. We are the ones who are stuck explaining to puzzled friends and relatives why seeing four consecutive Phish concerts was different from seeing four consecutive U2 concerts. Your expectations are different if you love improvisational music. At a Rolling Stones concert, you want “Satisfaction” to rock hard every time. At a Phish concert, you wanted “You Enjoy Myself” to be goth and dark one time, sentimentally beautiful another, bouncy and funky the next, and arena-metal rocking afterward. The biggest possible disappointment would have been a performance that aped the studio album version note-for-note. Improvisation requires a different type of talent, demanding that the musician adapt to the mood and atmosphere where he is performing, respond interactively to the progression of his fellow musicians, and move ahead without solid, known ground beneath his feet. This is the way that Anastasio thrives. Starting in 1996, Phish began a tradition of capping their summer tour with an outdoor, Woodstocky multi-day mega-concert with conceptual themes and three extended sets of music each day. Approaching the Clifford Ball, their first such festival, Anastasio foresaw a unique opportunity to play in previously foreign environments. In an interview with _Addicted to Noise_, Anastasio later described the different moods Jimi Hendrix displayed playing at different times of the day. Trey and his bandmates now had the opportunity to take the stage around the clock, and see where the different atmospheres would take their music: > Everybody always plays at 7:30 at night. [I wondered] what would it be like to play first thing in the morning? So we played the first day at sunset. Then we took a long break. Then we played that midnight or something or 11 PM. Then we hung out a few hours. Then at four in the morning we went out on this flatbed truck and did this rolling set where we were moving. Then went back, hung out, caught a couple hours of sleep, woke up. Then the next set was I think at noon the next day, which was first thing in the morning for me. I remember I woke up in this trailer, I had slept about four hours, came out, had a cup of coffee, finished the cup of coffee, put it down and walked right back out on stage. It was great. It was such a great feeling. It just seemed like this whole weekend ended up becoming one big thing. Trey took the stage off minimal sleep and was fueled by some coffee. If he had wanted to perform in yet another state of mind, he could have begun the set without the benefit of any coffee at all, but it is probably a good thing that Anastasio didn’t attempt this. ### A musical coffee talk The comparisons were inevitable. As Phish’s popularity began its ascent, and especially after Grateful Dead guitarist Jerry Garcia died in 1995, Anastasio had to allot a high percentage of his interviewing time downplaying the constant “Next Grateful Dead” slant in the line of questioning he faced. Dead fans, Phish fans, and Anastasio himself, could describe musical differences between the two bands until the Ben & Jerry’s cows came home, but it’s still easy to see why Phish was so frequently likened to the Dead – Musically, both were in their element on stage and generally out of their element in the recording studio, and the artistic focus of both was their live music. Any rock band whose bread and butter was a jamming, improvisational concert risked remaining in the shadow of the Grateful Dead, the most revered pioneers of jam-rock. The atmosphere at a Dead concert was also similar to that of a Phish concert, places where the parking lot on the days of a show was every bit as lively as inside the venue, buzzing with tour heads who were on the road with the band for months at a time, impromptu music circles, and unlicensed vendors peddling wares of varying legality. From the musical and technical to the stereotypical and superficial, there were plenty of reasons to mention the Dead and Phish in the same sentence. Phish, largely at Anastasio’s insistence, did what they could to thwart comparisons with the Grateful Dead, and while they played some Dead songs in their early bar gigs in the mid-1980s, they went most of the way through the 1990s without covering a single Dead song. That changed in the summer of 1998 when on the third anniversary of Garcia’s death, Phish surprised the Virginia Beach crowd with an encore of the Dead’s beloved “Terrapin Station.” Tapes of this concert are a sound to behold — as the sentimental opening notes are played, an increasing roar arises from the crowd as those in attendance begin to recognize the song. Nearly everybody seemed to recognize the unspoken significance of the song – that Phish was, at last, making peace with the fact that the jam-band torch had several years ago been passed into their hands from the Grateful Dead. Anastasio now seems to fully embrace the legacy of the Grateful Dead. About one year after the “Terrapin Station” icebreaker, Anastasio played with former Dead bassist Phil Lesh’s musical project, Phil & Friends. Lesh and Anastasio have since collaborated musically on several other occasions, but Anastasio seems most enthralled with the chance to talk to Lesh and drink coffee with him. Masato Kato [interviewed Trey](https://web.archive.org/web/20150601045910/http://www.philzone.com:80/interviews/trey/) in a May 2000 article for _The Phil Zone_, and the interview gives a very revealing look at the developing friendship between the two musicians: > Trey: It was great! I was just with [Lesh] two weeks ago. I did an interview with him for Revolver magazine – the two of us. It was incredible – not just to play with him but to talk to him. We spent a week together rehearsing. MK: Only a week? Trey: Yeah, if even that – it might’ve been four days or something like that. But it was every day and we got to sit and drink coffee and talk. He’s an incredible guy and obviously he’s got such an amazing history as a musician and just as a person that it was great for me – that was my favorite part – just the rehearsals – because, like I said, we would just sit and talk. I learned so much about music and living – you know, and just about being a good human being. You know, he has a lot of integrity. ### Not trying to live a completely caffeine-free life Phish’s song “Fee” made its concert debut in 1987, and was the opening cut on their first commercial album, “Junta.” While “Fee” is not the epic, multidimensional evolving jam song that would one day be Phish’s trademark, it is probably an anthem of sorts for many fans. Its lyrics, written exclusively by Anastasio, are almost bedtime story caliber, telling the story of Fee the weasel and his battle with Floyd the chimpanzee for the love of a “fading beauty” named Millie Grace. In the chorus, Anastasio has advice for Fee: > Oh, Fee, you’re trying to live a life That’s completely free. You’re racing with the wind You’re flirting with death So have a cup of coffee And catch your breath — Phish There were rumors among the Phish tour heads that one man in their midst had his name legally changed to Fee because, indeed, he was trying to live a completely free life. Get it?? The rumor is an old one, and it remains unknown to me whether this real-life Fee existed, let alone whether or not he succeeded in living a completely free life. From the lyrics, though, I can predict what Dr. Anastasio would have prescribed for this overzealous fan – a nice break from following the band around so diligently, and a cup of coffee in the comfort of home, before returning to the road with a new alias. It is debatable whether Phish was more instrumentally groundbreaking in their early days or their later ones, but few would dispute that their lyrics improved with time. “Fee” comes from a generation of Phish lyrics that were primarily nonsensical or surface-level narratives, and it wasn’t until the mid-1990s that their songs began to consistently show lyrical depth. “Theme From the Bottom” was first performed in 1995, a well-written and instrumentally complex song whose studio version landed on Phish’s 1996 CD “Billy Breathes.” The lyrics are the collaborative effort of all four band members and their chief lyricist Tom Marshall, and among those five is at least one who believes in the awakening powers of coffee: > I feed from the bottom, you feed from the top I live upon morsels you happen to drop And coffee that somehow leaks out of your cup If nothing comes down then I’m forced to swim up — Phish Ostensibly about a deep-sea creature who lurks in the darkness below, “Theme” seems like an allusion to suppressed thought or memory that remains unexposed to the light of day until something triggers its ascent to the surface, where color and light return. It subsists off leftovers and, of course, coffee, perhaps requiring a bit of a caffeine jolt to emerge from the unseen depth. On his solo tour, Trey has introduced an original instrumental which he calls “The Happy Coffee Song.” In the interest of full disclosure, I should admit that I’m unqualified to analyze this new addition to his setlist – I’ve heard it only once, and it left no lasting impression. Fans posting concert reviews have alternately described it as catchy or forgettable. Furthermore, there aren’t any lyrics to analyze, so we can only look at the simple fact that Anastasio remains inspired to keep coffee in his musical repertoire – not an insignificant fact. Happy are the coffee drinkers. ### The Mocha Dance Both in his own words and in those of others, Trey seems to consider coffee a staple of his life. In addition to all the unique situations in which he downed some coffee, he seems to drink it during more routine, everyday events. In an [interview](https://www.gadiel.com/phish/articles/sno.html) with Sno Magazine in December 1997, Anastasio described a morning routine of coffee and skiing in his Vermont house. “Just about four years ago we started [cross-country skiing] because we moved to where there’s a lot of woods’ Trey explained. “There’s other skiers nearby, people are cutting trails. I go almost every day when I’m home. I wake up, have a cup of coffee, strap on the skis and I’m out into the woods.” Others have noticed Trey benefitting from a coffee “pick-me-up”. The following comes from _Addicted To Noise_ (site down – MAY 2011), summarizing an interview they held with Anastasio in June 1995. “Recently, Addicted To Noise caught up with Anastasio the morning of a show at the Boise State University Pavilion. While initially quite sleepy, after some fruit and coffee, Anastasio was more than ready to talk shop.” Does his routine seem familiar to you? Whether he is doing something for the sheer love of it, like skiing, or fulfilling an obligation of his trade (conducting an interview), Trey gets rolling after his morning or early-day cup of coffee. Like his fellow coffee achievers the world over, he seems better able to perform at his best after the coffee is in his system. ### An incarnate extension of his music If there was any doubt before, this past year has made it clear that Anastasio’s life is now an incarnate extension of his music — daring to depart from the known and the safe and the structured biographical improv jam. He has demonstrated time and again a constant forward momentum and a desire to play his music in all conceivable scenarios with an ever-evolving cast of accomplices. And when he needs it, Anastasio isn’t afraid to down a cup of coffee or two. Be he solo, or back with Phish, or be he with any existing or future side projects, INeedCoffee salutes Trey Anastasio as a Coffee Achiever.

# Top 10 Dangers of the Coffee Enema [Coffee and Health](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/coffee-health/)---by [Tom Mossey](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/tom-mossey/)![Top 10 Dangers of the Coffee Enema](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/top-10-dangers-of-the-coffee-enema/dangers-of-coffee-enema.jpg) There is no scientific evidence to indicate that coffee enemas detoxify the bowel, liver, or gallbladder. The Gerson Therapy treatment, which includes daily coffee enemas, is currently being touted as an alternative cancer treatment. This is not only scientifically unproven, it is also a dangerous notion that encourages people to forgo proper medical treatment. ### Top 10 Dangers of the Coffee Enema The dangers associated with the coffee enema, green tea enema, coffee colonic (coffee or tea high enema), and coffee or tea suppository are as follows: 1. Adding ingredients to the enema recipe (such as coffee, green tea, vinegar, baking soda, bath/Epsom salt, or minerals) is not proven to do anything superior to the effects of plain saline. 2. Inserting anything into the anus may result in anal tearing. 3. Re-used (instead of single-use) enema kits may carry bacteria, which could result in an infection. 4. The use of hot liquid in the rectum could result in serious internal burns. 5. Extensive use of enemas could result in dehydration. 6. Overuse of coffee enemas could result in electrolyte imbalances. 7. The caffeine in the coffee or tea enema may lead to caffeine addiction. 8. Caffeine enemas must be avoided by pregnant women and people with caffeine sensitivity. 9. Overuse of any type of device designed to temporarily excite the nerves of the colon (such as an enema, colonic, or suppository) could result in decreased function of the bowels. 10. The colonic does not magically remove cancer-causing toxins. It will create watery stool and stimulate the release of fecal matter from the last few inches of the lower bowel. Do not forgo licensed medical attention in favor of this dangerous alternative. ### Still going to do a coffee enema? Minimize risks If you insist upon performing this dangerous procedure, please consider the following minimum precautions for the at-home coffee enema or tea enema. Use a short-nozzle, single-use disposable kit and utilize copious amounts of personal lubricant jelly during insertion. Be sure that the coffee is room temperature or cooler. Also, please minimize the numberer of enemas that you perform; at an absolute maximum, do one enema every week to ten days.![coffee enema kit](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/coffee-enema-kit.DX6-hhp7_2uyRge.webp) ### Resources [Coffee Enema Benefits vs Dangers](https://ineedcoffee.com/coffee-enema-benefits-vs-dangers/) – The article by health professional Kristina Amelong was submitted as a point-by-point response to this article.

# The Upside Down AeroPress Coffee Brewing Tutorial [Brewing Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/brewing-coffee/)---by [Michael Allen Smith](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/michael-allen-smith/)![The Upside Down AeroPress Coffee Brewing Tutorial](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/upside-aeropress-coffee-brewing-tutorial/upside-down-aeropress-tutorial.jpg) There are two main methods for brewing coffee with the AeroPress Coffee Maker. The first method is described in the directions that ship with the Aerobie AeroPress and in our [AeroPress Coffee Maker Tutorial](https://ineedcoffee.com/aeropress-coffee-maker-tutorial/). It is the regular top-down, straightforward brewing method. The second method is known as inverted or upside-down brewing, which I will highlight in this brewing tutorial. The experts are split on which method is best. According to Zachary Crockett’s article “The Invention of the AeroPress”, about half of the AeroPress World Championships winners use the inverted method. ### Upside Down Brewing Results in a Richer Taste When you brew inverted, all the coffee grounds will contact the water during the brewing period. This is called full or total immersion. Full immersion brewing methods are known for having a richer taste than brewing methods where the coffee begins passing through the filter immediately. The most popular full immersion brewing method is the French Press. ### When the Standard AeroPress Leaks or Brews Too Fast When the first version of this article was published in 2014, my AeroPress was getting old, and the seal wasn’t as strong. The coffee was leaking too fast through the brewing chamber, resulting in a weaker coffee. So, I began using the inverted method. Using the following tips, you can minimize the chance that your standard AeroPress brew will leak or brew too quickly. 1. Wet the paper filter. 2. Ensure the paper filter isn’t folded and is placed evenly in the filter cap. 3. Confirm the seal is tight. 4. The grind might be too coarse. 5. Use the funnel provided with the AeroPress to prevent loose grounds from entering the filter’s sealed area. 6. Some have found that using a wider rim mug reduces the chance of leakage. 7. If your AeroPress is old and losing its grip, consider buying a new one. My AeroPress was able to brew over 1,000 times, but eventually, it did need to be replaced. Or you could just use the Upside Down method. At 6 AM, I want my brewing method to be as foolproof as possible. The only way to mess up the inverted method is to lose control during the flip. There is still a possibility of leaking with the inverted method, but it matters far less since it happens at the end of the brewing period when the coffee is ready to exit the brewing chamber. ### Many Variations (Recipes) Work The AeroPress was invented in 2005, making it very young in terms of coffee brewing methods. Since then, coffee professionals have been tremendously interested in improving the instructions Aerobie ships with each unit. Today, there are numerous AeroPress competitions around the world. You will find a wide variance in approaches when you search for winning recipes. Brewing temperature, grind size, brewing time, and even plunge time can vary quite a bit. At first glance, the recipes’ complexity might seem intimidating, but they shouldn’t. The fact that people are making amazing coffee using wildly different parameters tells us that the AeroPress is harder to mess up than other coffee brewing methods. We are going to keep this tutorial simple. Once you’ve mastered the basics, you can venture out and try some award-winning recipes. ### Checklist Before we get started, confirm you have everything.![AeroPress Coffee Brewing Setup](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/aeropress-entire-brew-setup.VKG-kowi_Z1hd1HA.webp) 1. The brewing chamber of the AeroPress Coffee Maker. 2. The plunger. 3. Stir Paddle. Use a spoon if you lose the one that comes with the AeroPress. 4. Black filter cap 5. Paper filters (or you can use a reusable metal filter replacement such as the Able Brewing DISK). 6. A kitchen scale or the scoop that comes in the box. 7. Kettle 8. Timer or stopwatch. 9. Mug 10. Coffee. 11. Filtered or Drinking Water. 12. (optional and not in photo) AeroPress Funnel. ### #1 Grind Coffee and Heat Water A single AeroPress scoop is equal to 2 tablespoons or about 17 grams. Measuring coffee by volume will be less precise than by weight. The article [Why You Should Use a Scale to Brew Coffee](https://www.seriouseats.com/why-you-should-use-a-kitchen-scale-to-measure-coffee-coffee-brewing-equipment) makes a good case for tossing your scoop and grabbing the scale. Although I agree with the article, the AeroPress is very forgiving of a few grams of variation in brewing. Don’t think that not having a scale will keep you from brewing excellent coffee. Aerobie advises a grind between drip and espresso. I use a drip grind, while others use a coarser grind. When it comes to the grind size, the AeroPress is super forgiving. As a general rule, the finer you grind, the shorter your brew time will be.![aeropress coffee grind level next to dime](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/aeropress-grounds-dime.gslkXqUJ_Z1r3p9U.webp) ### #2 Setup the AeroPress in an Inverted Position and Add Coffee Place the plunger facing up on the counter. Now, turn the brewing chamber upside down and secure it onto the plunger. You want the stopper to rest in the middle of the #4 position. If you are concerned about messing up the flip, you can push it down further so the entire #4 is below the stopper. Other recipes say the entire #4 should be above the stopper, but in my opinion, this is too unstable. One bump, and you have a hot mess to clean up. Add the ground coffee. If you still have the AeroPress funnel, use it. I threw mine away, but I kind of wish I hadn’t because the funnel makes it easier for all the coffee grounds to get inside the brewing chamber and not get stuck on the rim of the brewer.![inverted aeropress with ground coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/aeropress-ground-coffee.D1IHTdkt_Z1IBXDX.webp) ### #3 Insert and Rinse the Filter Place a filter inside the filter cap and rinse with water. Set it aside for now.![rinse Aeropress coffee filter](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/aeropress-rinse-filter.DVIqPSB3_1x4Xy5.webp) ### #4 Start the Timer, Add Hot Water and Stir How hot should the water be for AeroPress brewing? Opinions vary quite a bit. Most of the recipes say to use 200-205°F, but Aerobie recommends using 175°F. From the Aeropress FAQ: > Books often recommend a brewing temperature of 195° F to 200° F (91° C to 93° C). This is good for conventional brewing methods that pass hot water through a bed of coffee. In this method, the water rapidly cools so the lower part of the bed is operating at a lower temperature. However in the AeroPress all of the coffee particles contact the same water temperature during the stirring phase. The top 3 finishers at the 2014 World AeroPress Championships used brewing temperatures of 174°F (78°C), 197°F (92°C), and 180°F (82°C). In previous years, you had winning recipes that were just off boiling. The lesson here is that the AeroPress can be brewed at various temperatures. To keep things simple, I boil water and let it cool for 20-30 seconds. If you have a programmable kettle, experiment. Start the timer. There are two schools of thought on adding hot water and stirring. 1. Add half the water, stir, and then add the remaining water. 2. Add all the water and stir. Although I’ve heard compelling arguments that #1 is better, I have done it both ways and can not tell a difference. The important thing about this step is to ensure all the ground coffee is in contact with water. Try it both ways for yourself.![Pour hot water AeroPress coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/aeropress-pour-water.cYDA1YEm_GtmsI.webp)![stir Aeropress coffee with paddle](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/aeropress-stir.FbzlLwMu_V1gkt.webp) Because I use a more snug fit, I fill the water halfway between the #1 and #2 circle.![Water filled in AeroPress coffee - brewing ](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/aeropress-invert-setup.L9rZqUT0_1DAqir.webp) ### #5 Secure the Filter Cap on the AeroPress Hold onto the AeroPress where the two chambers meet and with your other hand, screw the filter onto the brewer.![AeroPress Coffee Secure Filter](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/aeropress-secure-filter.D6V1QJTE_1vqDcC.webp) ### #6 At 60-90 Seconds, Flip and Press You can use many different brew times. A good starting range is 60-90 seconds in total. When this time has passed, grab the AeroPress, holding both chambers together, and flip it so it is over your mug. Press down the plunger once the AeroPress is back right-side-up and over the mug. Use a slow, steady press. It should take about 20 seconds to press fully.![Aeropress coffee - flip and plunge](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/aeropress-mid-brew.DnGEbUCp_qPyk6.webp) ### #7 Add Water to Taste What you have now is a coffee concentrate. Add some hot water to bring it to the consistency of brewed coffee. Typically, this means adding 50% water. If you want an iced coffee, just pour over a cup of ice cubes. I should also add that you don’t need to add anything if you want to have an “espresso-like” beverage. Because the AeroPress can not generate near the pressure of a true espresso machine, I do not consider it espresso. Nor does home coffee roasting retailer Sweet Maria’s. From their AeroPress page: > Illy’s research shows that espresso is a beverage brewed at 7-11 bars of pressure, with water temperature between 194 and 203 F (without temperature loss from a cold coffee handle, etc). Even if the AeroPress had the organoleptic features of espresso, and the appearance of espresso, I don’t think it is within these parameters. If you go the “espresso-like” route, you can experiment using less water, a finer grind, and a shorter brewing time. ### The Most Forgiving Brewing Method Ever I’ve tried many different methods for brewing coffee; none are as forgiving as the AeroPress. You can brew using various grinds, temperatures, and dosages and still make excellent coffee. You can even flip it upside down, and it excels. ### Resources [The Invention of the AeroPress](https://priceonomics.com/the-invention-of-the-aeropress/) – Excellent article by Zachary Crockett.

# Vac Pot Brewing with the Yama Syphon [Brewing Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/brewing-coffee/)---by [Ryan Jacobs](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/ryan-jacobs/)![Vac Pot Brewing with the Yama Syphon](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/vac-pot-brewing-with-the-yama-syphon/Vac-Pot-Brewing-Yama-Syphon.jpg) While I haven’t personally used other stovetop vacuum brewers, I have heard mostly horror stories of plugged filters, slow/incomplete brewing, bad seals, etc. The Yama Syphon (Yama Siphon) brewer has shown none of these symptoms for me. I have also found this extremely easy to use and clean up. Of course, usability is worth nothing if the result tastes horrible. Here, too, the Yama does very well. Properly used, the coffee you brew will be richer than a French press and without all the extra sediment. It will be incredibly smooth. ### Preparing the Coffee The coffee for this brewer should be ground just as you would for an automatic drip coffee maker. The amount of coffee you use will vary to taste, but I recommend between 3 and 4 tablespoons to start with. Next, place the filter disc into the globe so that the spring hangs down into the glass rod. Pull the chain and ‘hook’ it around the bottom of the glass rod. After this is assembled, place the coffee into the top of the globe and spread evenly.![Preparing the Yama Syphon](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/yama-prep1.Y_DA-2VC_Z1dKYyf.webp)_Preparing the Yama Syphon._![Vac-Pot Coffee brewing](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/yama-coffee.C0VsqXDC_Z2l0Wl4.webp)_Vac-Pot Coffee brewing_### Filling With Water Fill the Yama Siphon to the “5” setting at most. I have heard that you can slightly overfill it, but I have had some boilovers occasionally when doing this. Next, place the _diffuser_ on your electric burner. Turn the stove to medium heat only. Don’t be tempted to turn it up higher in order to heat the water faster. You can measure with a thermometer the temperature of the water as it heats and wait to place the top globe on until a certain temperature that you prefer. Or you can assemble the unit at once. I prefer to assemble the unit early. ### Watch Vac Pot As the saying goes, _a watched pot never boils_, but in this case, that is a good thing. With vacuum coffee, the water doesn’t actually boil. It is really quite fun to watch the brewing process. It begins slowly as some of the water escapes the building pressure in the lower chamber by traveling up through the glass tube and into the top chamber.![Stir the coffee grounds](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/vac-pot-stir-coffee.Dj6EIMRY_Z1nKHjl.webp)_Stir the coffee grounds._![Yama Vac Pot](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/vac-pot-brewing.Y819Eu6G_Z20syo.webp)*Yama Glass Coffee Siphon * As long as there is a little bit of water in the Yama Siphon’s bottom chamber, it will continue to generate vapor pressure to push heated water into the top chamber. When the water is kind of gurgling in the bottom (when the level has gone below the top of the glass rod), let this action continue for about 30 seconds. Then, remove the unit from the heat source and wait for the water to filter back down through.![Yama Syphon coffee finished](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/vac-pot-brew-complete.BlmzUyej_AVBWY.webp)_The Yama Syphon coffee is now finished brewing._### Let Vac Pot Cool Down Before you disassemble the Yama Syphon, let the top of the glass globe cool down for at least a minute. Then, carefully remove the top by gently rocking the globe until it is free. You can now remove the lid and turn it upside down to use as a stand for the globe while you pour the coffee.![cool and remove top chamber](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/cool-down-vac-pot.CZ8_0waY_kkD1d.webp)_Allow the glass tube to cool before you disassemble._### Conclusion Overall, the Yama Syphon provides a really great cup of vacuum-brewed coffee at a reasonable price. It works well on an electric stove, which can’t be said of other units in its class. I believe the secret is the cloth filter, which doesn’t get plugged up and does an excellent job of filtering. These filters, however, are also the main problem, as they are hard to come by without buying a new unit. It would be easy to create these out of linen cloth using your current filter as the pattern. I haven’t tried this, but I have heard it works fine. ### Resources [Vacuum Pot Brewing](https://ineedcoffee.com/vacuum-pot-brewing/) – Article by Ryan Jacobs that highlights different vac-pot brewers.

# The Barista Home Espresso Machine Tutorial [Espresso](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/espresso/)---by [Ryan Jacobs](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/ryan-jacobs/)![The Barista Home Espresso Machine Tutorial](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/using-the-barista-home-espresso-machine/pulling-espresso-shots.jpg) The Starbucks Barista home espresso machine is easy to use and is capable of producing high-quality espresso. This is a very good, compact, sturdy machine capable of delivering a consistent shot of espresso and good quality steamed milk. It is also available at a relatively reasonable price. ### The Design The Barista is very simple in design. There are two push buttons on the right-hand side of the machine and one on the left. Also on the left side is a wheel used to deliver steam or hot water through the wand. There is a water reservoir and a tube that resides in the tank area for water uptake. The Barista comes with a portafilter (the part with a handle), two different baskets (one is for use with the espresso “pods”, the other is for use with loose espresso), and a measuring scoop. ### Fill The Reservoir Pull out the water reservoir before using the Barista espresso machine, as shown in the picture. A trick I use to ensure there is water without pulling the tank out completely is to place a ping pong ball or two into the reservoir. It is easier to examine the water level by seeing how high the ping pong balls are floating rather than trying to judge the water level through the glare on the smoke-colored plastic. After filling the reservoir with water, slide it into place while making sure that the water intake tube is gently placed inside the tank.![Add Ping Pong Balls to water tank for espresso machine](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/barista-ping-pong-balls1.BrbLUQb__1rHDAQ.webp)_Using Ping Pong Balls to See Water Level_![Fill the Water Reservoir of espresso machine](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/fill-water-reservoir.BKoIjZ4D_lUqco.webp)_Fill the Water Reservoir_### Turning It On The left button turns on the machine. Depress the button, and the button turns red. Wait for approximately 40 seconds for the machine to warm up. The warming process is complete when the green light on the right side of the machine is illuminated.![Powering On the Barista Espresso Machine](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/power-on-barista-machine.CFhEzGmd_PDE21.webp)_Powering On the Barista Machine_### Preparing the Milk Frothing milk is an essential attribute of a good barista. And, since you own a Barista machine, you can perfect this art in the comfort of your own home. If you’ve decided that you are enough of an espresso lover to buy an espresso machine, you should probably spend a few more dollars and get a straight-walled metal pitcher and a thermometer. Fill the pitcher with the appropriate amount of cold milk (right above freezing). Do not fill the pitcher to the rim, or it **will** overflow. Never reheat milk.![Frothing Milk for Starbucks Barista Espresso Machine](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/frothing-milk.CN8aHlZI_bQETz.webp)_Frothing Milk_### Clear the wand? Depress the button on the lower right of the machine to prepare steam for frothing. The green light will turn off. Wait a few seconds, and the light will illuminate again. With the steam button depressed and the green light on, place the steaming wand just below the milk line, then turn the knob on the left side of the machine. This will shoot the steam out of the wand. You will actually be able to hear the sound of air getting injected into the milk. The first few seconds of heating the milk are very important. It is during this time that you can create the most froth. The best froth is dense with tiny bubbles. When the milk reaches around the 80F mark, slip the steaming wand down the side of the metal pitcher, deep into the milk. The milk should start swirling around the wand. Continue heating the milk to the 140F – 160F mark. If you heat the milk any higher than 160F, it will lose its sweetness and scald your tongue.![Clean the Frothing Wand of the Starbucks Barista Espresso Machine](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/clean-frothing-wand-1.DxKpRq0q_BpA0O.webp)_Clean the Frothing Wand_ When you have steamed the milk, pull it away from the steaming wand and simultaneously turn the knob to the “off” position. When you are done, quickly and carefully wipe the wand with a clean, wet washcloth to get rid of the milk residue. Then, turn off the steam button by pressing it again. Swirl the milk in the pitcher after you’ve heated it. If there are large, visible bubbles, tap the metal pitcher on the countertop to settle the bubbles. The ideal state for the frothed milk is thick and velvety. Set the milk to the side and prepare to pull your shots of espresso.![frothing wand cleaning for Starbucks Barista espresso machine](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/clean-frothing-wand-2.CVnGLkoj_Qx6wt.webp)_The frothing wand is now clean._### Priming the Pump If you have just finished steaming milk, wait for the light to turn green again. Next, place the portafilter under the brewing group while it is empty. Press the top-right button to bring a shower of hot water into the portafilter. This serves to warm the portafilter and prime the pump. It makes a real difference in the quality of the shot, so don’t skip this step.![Prime the Pump - Starbucks Barista Espresso machine](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/prime-the-pump.DdIRuXeO_Zr73ok.webp)_Prime the Pump_### Tamping the espresso For more information on the importance and art of tamping, read the [Espresso Tamping Visual Tutorial](https://ineedcoffee.com/espresso-tamping/). Once you’ve filled the portafilter and tamped the espresso, align the handle so that it is about 45 degrees to your left, and insert it into the group head. Then, twist the handle back so that it fits tight. ### Pulling the shot You are now ready to pull your first doppio or double espresso. For measurement purposes, you should purchase espresso glasses or metal cups that denote the one-ounce mark. Measure the time that it takes to pull the shot until it is second nature to you. The total time should be 15 – 18 seconds for a ristretto and 18 – 23 seconds for a regular shot. If you time your shots precisely, you can brew directly into two demitasse cups without the need to measure and re-pour. If your machine is pushing out the espresso at a faster rate, you should use the group tightener to tighten the screw on the underside of the group head. This will restrict water flow to ensure that the espresso is brewed properly.![Pulling Espresso Shots with Starbucks Barista Espresso machine](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/pulling-espresso-shots.DUnuKbgH_ZOUprh.webp)_Pulling Espresso Shots_### Using the Espresso - If you want straight espresso, just pour the espresso into demitasse cups. - If you are making an Americano, pour your espresso into a mug. Now, put the clean frothing wand into the mug and turn the knob (don’t push any buttons this time). This will shoot hot water into your espresso. Fill to the desired strength. - If you are making a cappuccino or latte, you can now pour the espresso into a cup, mug, or glass and pour the frothed milk on top of the espresso.![Making Cappuccino foam with Starbucks Barista Espresso Machine ](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/making-cappuccino.CkSxCyNY_Zd3FY1.webp)_Making Cappuccino_ In addition to the basic recipes we have covered here, you can make many more creations with espresso and the Barista espresso machine.

# Vacuum Pot Brewing [Brewing Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/brewing-coffee/)---by [Ryan Jacobs](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/ryan-jacobs/)![Vacuum Pot Brewing](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/vacuum-pot-brewing/vac-pot-completed.jpg) Vacuum brewers come in many shapes and sizes, yet they are more alike than they are different. They have the same basic components and operate on the same basic principles. You may also hear of these devices referred to as vac pots. In this article, we’ll do an overview of things common in vacuum brewing and offer tips that should help you regardless of the device you choose. A few of the more popular models are listed below in their respective price ranges. ### $25-$50 – Yama Syphon (Siphon); Bodum Santos Glass These brewers are glass models and are generally heated by placing them on a range. The Yama offers a tabletop model that gets its heat from an alcohol burner. The brewing process is manual which is great if you love more control. ### $100-$150: Bodum Electric Santos (this is the same as the Starbucks Utopia) This device has a self-contained heating plate and is pretty much automatic in terms of brewing. You just push a button, and it does the rest. Because of its heating device, it can be used as a dual electric water kettle. ### $200+: Cona Vacuum Brewers These are similar to the Yama and Bodum Santos Glass units but are more pleasing to the eye and only use alcohol burners for heat. In addition, the coffee brewed in these models only touches the glass, meaning that your coffee will taste more like coffee. ### Common Vac Pot Parts![vac pot lower chamber](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/vac-pot-lower-chamber.CQ0MHqWV_Z1tLEBp.webp)_Vac Pot – Lower Chamber_![Vac Pot - Upper Chamber](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/vac-pot-upper-chamber.BwRajzbv_Z1zd1sX.webp)_Vac Pot – Upper Chamber_ Vac pots have a lower chamber to hold the brewing water as well as an upper brewing chamber. The two chambers are generally sealed together with a rubber gasket. A tube from the upper chamber extends into the lower chamber, allowing water to flow between them. A filter of some sort prevents the coffee grounds from flowing down into the lower chamber. ### Common Principles Vac pots suck. I don’t mean that in a negative manner, but they utilize suction to brew the coffee. The way this works is that the water in the lower chamber is heated by some source, often a gas or electric range and causes water vapor to be produced. This increases the pressure in the lower chamber and forces the water upward. When the heat is removed, the gases in the lower chamber cool and begin drawing the brewed coffee downward via suction caused by a partial vacuum. ### Common Tips Regardless of the type of device you are brewing with, the following tips should be useful: ### #1 Preheat your water Heat the water in the lower chamber to just below boiling before connecting the brewing chamber. If you connect the lower chamber to the brewing chamber with cold water, you will have a situation where water slowly seeps upward and makes contact with some of the coffee grounds. This means you can’t really control your brewing time as much. ### #2 Proper Brewing Time A key factor in the flavor of your brew will depend on how long you allow the water to steep with the coffee grounds. I like mine to brew for about 1.5 minutes. I measure this starting at the moment that the overwhelming majority of the water has entered the upper chamber and looks like it is boiling (it actually isn’t). You can adjust the steeping time a bit longer or shorter to your preference. Occasionally, when the rolling action starts, you may find that the grounds form almost a floating crust that clearly isn’t making contact with the water. You’ll want to detect this early on and assist it with a stir of a spoon.![Vac Pot - Stir](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/vac-pot-stir.24CdzGKi_Z24KMx5.webp)_Vac Pot – Stir_### #3 Proper Grind and Dose You want your grind to be basically the same as you would use for automatic drip coffee. Also, you will want to use the same dosage as you would in automatic drip brewing. ### #4 Assist the Cooling Once the brewing time is up, we really want that contraction of gases in the lower chamber to begin so that the suction begins. Again, this helps control the brewing time. The simplest way to do this is to carefully remove the brewer from its heat source. Move it from the still-warm burner to a cool one. Don’t go overboard with this, though, by surrounding the bottom chamber in an ice bath or similar methods. Firstly, unless you have really high-quality glass, you risk it cracking from the shock. Secondly, you still want your coffee to be hot.![Vac Pot - Completed](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/vac-pot-completed.C3HBla2t_ZuVxlN.webp)_Vac Pot – Completed_ I hope these general tips will assist you in your vac pot brewing ventures. ### Resources [Vac Pot Brewing with the Yama Syphon](https://ineedcoffee.com/vac-pot-brewing-with-the-yama-syphon/) – A brewing tutorial for the Yama.

# Vac Pot Brewing with the Bodum Santos [Brewing Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/brewing-coffee/)---by [Ryan Jacobs](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/ryan-jacobs/)![Vac Pot Brewing with the Bodum Santos](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/vac-pot-brewing-with-the-bodum-santos/bodum-santos-vac-pot-coffee-brewer.jpg) The Bodum Santos vac pot will produce really wonderful coffee if you can learn to operate it properly. Vac pots, in general, produce a coffee that is every bit as rich as French Pressed coffee, but is less gritty in the cup. This unit is designed for use on a stove burner or alcohol lamp. Priced under $50, this unit is an affordable way to discover the joys of vacuum brewed coffee.![bodum santos vac pot coffee brewer](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/bodum-santos-vac-pot-coffee-brewer.CiiYC_WQ_ZhFFQC.webp)*Bodum Santos Stovetop Glass Vacuum 34-Ounce Coffee Maker *### Setting Up the Vac Pot The setup for brewing coffee with the Santos is very similar to other vacuum brewers. Begin by putting the water in the lower chamber or carafe of the brewing unit. Next, set it on the burner and begin heating at medium heat. This is perhaps the most important factor in vacuum brewing in general. A gentle, even heat will help the process. The Bodum comes with a lid to put on the carafe while heating, which helps retain a bit of heated water vapor.![heating vac pot water](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/heating1.C9kdZfrL_2k907J.webp)_Heating water for the vac pot coffee._### Prepare the Coffee While the water is heating, go ahead and set up the top chamber by affixing the filter so that it is centered around the hole. Then add your coffee (ground to auto-drip) to the top and spread it around evenly. By now, the water in the carafe should be warming up gently, and we can affix the top portion of the brewer to the bottom. Make certain you have the two pieces joined evenly so that a proper seal is made, being careful not to force them together too tightly.![Santos brewing](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/brewing.Qp0AQLmz_Z2jeGNL.webp)_Vacuum Pot coffee brewing starts._### Watch, Swirl, and Wait The next step is to wait and watch the brewing process. Slowly and surely, the level of the water from the bottom will rise through the glass tube into the upper chamber. When the coffee grounds become saturated with water, I like to take a knife or spoon and gently swirl the water and the grounds to make sure none of the grounds float above the water without being extracted by the water. After this is complete, I like to place the lid on the coffee brewer and wait for the magic moment when most of the water from the bottom is gone and the brewing process is completely rolling above. ### Active Brewing and Settling![vac pot brewing upper chamber](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/close.DOFWpS-J_Z4mMAD.webp)_Vac-Pot coffee brewing is in progress._ When the rolling happens, let it continue for around 30 seconds or so, and then remove the entire unit from the heat. In a few seconds, after the heat has been removed, the coffee should slowly make its way to the bottom and into the carafe.![vac pot drops](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/drop150x.B3lB4Nwh_o39Nx.webp)_The vac-pot coffee drops to the lower chamber._![vac pot finished](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/done150x156.CLlEMbHq_1OzwFs.webp)_Vacuum Pot coffee is now finished brewing._### Conclusion Now that the coffee has been fully brewed, all that is left to do is carefully remove the top chamber, place it in the holding stand, and pour yourself a mug of coffee. Overall, this device operates similar to the Yama Syphon and is priced similarly, with some differences in filtration and brewing capacity.

# Vac Pot Brewing with the Starbucks Utopia [Brewing Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/brewing-coffee/)---by [Lura Lee](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/lura-lee/)![Vac Pot Brewing with the Starbucks Utopia](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/vac-pot-brewing-with-the-starbucks-utopia/utopia2_160x200.jpg) Whether you love Starbucks or hate ’em, you have to acknowledge their prowess in distributing and marketing coffee-related products. Well, they’ve done it again. On Tuesday, October 17th, 2000, Starbucks officially released a “new” coffee brewing system: the Barista Utopia. This is a vacuum brewing method, so it really isn’t new. What is new is the fact that this is an electric vacuum system. Most vacuum pots require a gas or electric stovetop or separate burner. This system was actually developed by Bodum and has been available in Europe for a couple of years. The styling is stereotypical “euro” in that it is both angular and sleek. Taking a cue from the popularity of the iMac, it exposes much of the inner workings of the machine and is available in two colors: clear and a see-through “graphite,” which is kind of a blue-gray color. It retails for $170 in the U.S.A. Brewing coffee is pretty easy with this system. It is certainly easier than any other vacuum system I’ve ever experienced, but it is a little more challenging than the average drip brewing machine. In my opinion, the stylish look, easy cleanup, and programmable features of this brewing system make it a really good investment for any serious coffee fan. Vacuum pot brewing creates a coffee that is a real treat: it preserves many of the oils that one gets with the French Press, without as much sediment. Thus, you get a cup of coffee that is as clean as drip-brewed coffee, with as much of the oils and richness as French Pressed coffee. ### The Process When you first get the machine, you’ll probably watch the video. The included video will only tell you half the story and is surrounded by a lot of marketing frou-frou talk. If you make the coffee right away, you might end up with a bitterly brewed first cup. So let me walk you through the process in a more step-by-step fashion.![The Starbucks Barista Utopia](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/utopia157x2001.Boqo64_c_1Ifna7.webp)_The Starbucks Barista Utopia_### Clean and Season Remove all the pieces from the box. Identify the coffee filter basket, filter, and basket cover (the parts that sit on top of the carafe). Rinse these pieces with water and set them to the side. Identify the carafe and rinse it out with water, but **never submerge the carafe in water**. Plug in the base and set the clock. Fill the carafe with 6-10 cups of clean, cold water. **Do not add coffee to the coffee filter basket yet**. Before putting the filter basket on top of the carafe, use both hands to put the filter in place, creating a good seal; then put it on the top of the filter basket. Place the assembled coffee filter basket on top of the carafe, and place the carafe on the heating/power base. Turn on the machine and let it go through a “brewing” cycle without wasting your coffee grounds. Doing this will “season” the pot and remove most of the odd plastic tastes associated with manufacturing and shipping. If you skip this step, you will probably be less than thrilled with your first pot of coffee. If you want to make a pot of coffee immediately after seasoning the Utopia, empty the carafe and turn the Utopia off. It is important that you allow the appliance to cool slightly before you attempt to move on to the next step. ### Grinding the Coffee The included video from Starbucks indicates using 2 tablespoons of coffee for every 6 oz. of water. I found this to be a pretty strong brew. Unless you like your coffee strong, you might want to try lowering the ratio to 2 tablespoons of coffee for every 8 oz. of water. Expect to try a few times before finding the perfect personal ratio. The grind should be a medium grind, exactly the same grind that you would use with a drip coffee machine. Grind the coffee and set it to the side. ### Using the Machine Make sure that the filter has a good seal. You’ll want to use both hands to grip the coffee filter basket to do this. Fill the carafe with the appropriate amount of water, in proportion to the amount of coffee that you intend to use. **Note: you may not use the Utopia with less than 4 cups of water or more than 10 cups (20 – 50 oz.) of water.** Place the carafe on the heating/power base, pull back the carafe lid, and place the funnel of the coffee filter basket in the body of the carafe. Pour the coffee into the filter basket and fasten the filter basket lid. Position the filter basket piece with the lid so that the grip area on the basket filter lid is aligned with the handle of the carafe. Make sure that the coffee filter basket fits securely so that a seal is created. Turn the machine on by depressing the on/off button.![Add coffee ito upper chamber](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/fillcoffee157x200.CxhgXyzi_QieoL.webp)_Add coffee to the upper chamber_ The brewing cycle will begin. The power light will illuminate, indicating that the machine is on. As the water heats, some will begin to rise. The water level in the coffee filter basket will rise and slowly saturate the coffee grounds. At a certain point, the majority of the water will make a dramatic rise into the coffee filter basket. A small amount of water will remain in the carafe; this is normal. The coffee will bubble and swirl. When the coffee is heated to 205 F (96 C), the coffee sensor temporarily shuts off the power to the base, and a vacuum is created. After the coffee has been brewed for an appropriate amount of time, the brewed coffee will begin to drop back into the carafe. As the swollen grounds settle on the filter, the coffee will hesitate on the return journey.![utopia brewing 1](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/utopia1_160x200.B_X_TAT3_6LRwa.webp)![utopia brewing 2](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/utopia2_160x200.CqVuFoEI_Zidb3A.webp)![utopia brewing 3](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/utopia3_160x200.D4nrLHVX_Z1IoV6E.webp)![utopia brewing 4](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/utopia4_160x200.cz17EbL1_17M8cQ.webp) When the coffee has settled in the carafe, place one hand on the carafe handle and use the other to pull back and peel off the coffee filter basket and lid. The base has a special feature: a stand for the coffee filter basket’s funnel. Place the coffee filter basket on the stand, flip the top of the carafe into position, and remove the carafe from the base. You can now pour yourself an excellent cup of coffee.![remove upper chamber](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/lid193x200.CP3weWsf_ZRydBC.webp)_Remove the upper chamber_![Place top section onto holder](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/holder193x200.CtJ1E7z9_Z3g4Pp.webp)_Place the top section onto the holder_![pour coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/pour193x200.Cny6OJK9_r1pIk.webp)_Pour the Coffee_### Keep Warm The Utopia has two features that clearly distinguish it from the rest of the vacuum pot family and make it akin to popular drip coffee machines: a “keep warm” feature and a programming feature. The base will keep the coffee in the carafe warm for a total of 2 hours, and the heat sensors will shut off the power base entirely if the carafe has not been returned to the base within 8 minutes. Starbucks claims that their keep warm feature does not continue to “cook” the coffee, but they don’t indicate in any of the associated literature exactly how their power base adjusts the temperature depending on the amount of coffee in the carafe, or how the heat is delivered to the system without cooking the coffee. Starbucks suggests that if you have removed the carafe for more than 8 minutes and the power base is turned off, you should pour the remaining coffee into a thermal carafe. You must never turn the Utopia on in an effort to keep previously-brewed coffee warm because this will trigger another brewing cycle. My advice: if you removed the carafe for over eight minutes and didn’t drink the coffee, pour it into your cup or pour it down the drain. (I’m not a big fan of thermal carafes.) ### Programming Programming the Utopia is very simple, and it’s just like programming a digital alarm clock. Press and hold the “Auto On” button for about 5 seconds. Then, set the clock using the hour and minute buttons. Press the “Auto On” button again and a yellow light will come on, indicating that you’ve successfully programmed the machine. Just don’t forget to load up the machine with water and coffee before you go to bed. ### Summary Vacuum pot brewed coffee is wonderful, and every serious coffee drinker should experience it. If you are ready to move past drip coffee makers, but you aren’t ready to commit to other, traditional-style vacuum pot systems, you might consider the Utopia. It combines much of the ease of a drip coffee maker with the richness of the French press. Simply put: the Starbucks Barista Utopia is the easiest vac-pot system on the market.

# Vietnamese Coffee Culture [Coffee History](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/coffee-history/)---by [Stefanie Spencer](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/stefanie-spencer/)![Vietnamese Coffee Culture](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/vietnamese-coffee-culture/vietnamese-coffee-prep1.jpg) In America, it seems we try to do everything so fast. We have a drive-through, pre-made, just microwave, fast food kind of lifestyle. Here is another coffee idea to let you stop for a minute or two and enjoy some quiet time, or just spend some time with friends. The coffee culture of Vietnam stems from a time when it was a French colony, but it also has deep roots within itself, being the fourth largest coffee exporting nation. If you visit a Vietnamese restaurant and order coffee, you might be surprised when they bring you a cup, partially filled with sweetened, condensed milk, and some hot water. Where’s the coffee? You make it fresh, right at your table.![vietnamese coffee prep](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/vietnamese-coffee-prep1.DkescBoN_ZtUcGw.webp)_Photo by [Sue Richards](http://www.flickr.com/photos/suerichards/227557760/)_ The gadget that makes this work is the Vietnamese coffee press. It is a little metal cup, perched on top of the coffee cup. It is perforated with tiny holes in the bottom, acting as the filter. In the restaurant, they will have already added a few teaspoons of coffee, and traditionally, this will be a blend of dark roasted coffee and roasted chicory. They tighten the filter down over the coffee (it screws into the bottom part), add the sweetened, condensed milk to the coffee cup, and present it to you. Taking the just below boiling water, fill the little metal cup 1/4 of the way full. After this has dripped through, you loosen the filter for two full revolutions and then fill it to the top, which takes about 4 ounces of water. It should then take about 4 minutes for this to completely drip through. After this is complete, stir to mix the white, caramel-like sweetness at the bottom with the black, strong coffee goodness at the top. It should resemble rich, creamy, smooth, melted coffee ice cream. While you can drink it hot, which would be called **ca phe sua nong**, traditionally, it would be poured over ice, which is called **ca phe sua da**. Take a trip to a Vietnamese restaurant and enjoy. ### Resources [Vietnamese Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/brew-vietnamese-coffee/) – A step-by-step brewing tutorial.

# Visiting the Starbucks Mothership [Coffee History](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/coffee-history/)---by [Tim Schenck](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/tim-schenck/)![Visiting the Starbucks Mothership](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/visiting-the-starbucks-mothership/visit-starbucks-mothership.jpg)_This article is excerpted from the newly released book Holy Grounds: The Surprising Connection Between Coffee and Faith — From Dancing Goats to Satan’s Drink (Fortress Press)._ Full disclosure: I’ve always had a love/hate relationship with Starbucks. Okay, mostly a hate/hate relationship because I just don’t enjoy their coffee. I understand how they played an integral role in shaping American coffee culture, but I don’t appreciate darkly roasted coffee served at scalding temperatures. Not my thing. So I admit to being slightly wary of, if grateful for, the invitation to visit the Starbucks mothership in Seattle. I was on sabbatical from my real job as pastor of a congregation on Boston’s South Shore, researching a book on the intersection of coffee and faith. I figured, besides visiting coffee farms in Central America, drinking espresso in Rome, and hanging out with coffee roasting monks in Pennsylvania, I should make a pilgrimage to Seattle, the ground zero of the American coffee revolution. While you can simply wander into one of nearly thirty thousand Starbucks worldwide, you can’t just show up at Starbucks headquarters and expect to gain admittance to their corporate offices. Fortunately, a parishioner of mine works with Starbucks in some vague financial services industry capacity, and he pulled a few strings to get me a tour. My childhood friend Kevin Daniels, who moved to Seattle from Baltimore nearly twenty-five years ago, joined me on this excursion. He’s become a coffee aficionado himself over the years, although I was surprised to learn he doesn’t wear plaid shirts every day and listens exclusively to concert bootlegs of Nirvana. Pulling up to the corporate headquarters is impressive in itself. Housed in a massive red brick building constructed in 1912 in Seattle’s industrial district, it was formerly owned by Sears Roebuck and Company. Rechristened the Starbucks Center in 1997, it’s topped by a clock tower over which looms the top half of the familiar green mermaid in a sort of Kilroy Was Here vibe. While most independent coffee shops are run out of a small back office within shouting distance from the whir of the espresso machine’s steam wand, that’s not how Starbucks operates. Starbucks brews a unique blend of corporate and coffee culture.![Starbucks HQ](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/StarbucksHQ_650.BhRhf7Mr_Z3frxS.webp)_Starbucks HQ_ Following proper vetting and the issuing of official visitor badges, Kevin and I were met by our gracious hosts. The corporate loyalty displayed by everyone we encountered was astonishing. I won’t reference Kool-Aid, since we’re speaking of coffee and want no negative connotation, but people who work at Starbucks are passionate about both coffee and the company’s mission. Starbucks remains uniquely qualified and positioned to influence the global coffee industry, and they take that responsibility seriously. What amazed me most was visiting the employees-only, fully staffed Starbucks nestled in between the offices. From human resources managers to executive secretaries to bean counters (not those beans) to quality-control tasters, this is a well-caffeinated workforce. Granted, I couldn’t help but think about the poor baristas who had to work there. They were friendly, highly competent, and probably the crème de la crème of the barista population, but it induced nightmares of having to preach to a church full of pastors. Not that coffee folks would be as judgmental as fellow clergy, but still! Don’t tell anyone, but in addition to the regular Starbucks menu items, the in-house operation also offers special coffees not available in the regular stores. I had a Nicaraguan single-origin coffee expertly brewed on an $11,000 Clover brewing machine, which is basically like a French press in reverse without the nasty grounds getting into the cup. Or as our guide put it to me as I stared in rapt wonder at the Clover in action, it’s like “drinking coffee in high definition.” And it was.![In-house Starbucks ](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/InhouseStarbucks650.CkL_KQey_1XeGjR.webp)_In House Starbucks_ Starbucks is unlike any other coffee company in the world in terms of its market share, number of employees, and the sheer volume of coffee sourced, roasted, brewed, and served. Yes, they maintain their status as a hugely profitable global corporation. You may or may not love their coffee, and you may or may not love their methods, but there are people from Howard Schultz on down trying to make a difference in the lives of those up and down the coffee supply chain, and I was immensely grateful for this unique look at the operation. After bidding farewell to our hosts, Kevin and I made our way to the new Starbucks Reserve Roastery and Tasting Room in Seattle’s vibrant Capitol Hill neighborhood. I was particularly keen to visit the Roastery, as even battle-hardened coffee-industry professionals speak glowingly about the place’s sleek design and technological prowess. Starbucks has opened several of these new concept stores in various markets worldwide. The original one is in Seattle, naturally, on the famous Pike Street, just nine blocks from the original Starbucks. The Reserve Roastery is many things: pilgrimage site for Starbucks lovers; a mind-blowing coffee experience for people enamored with different brewing techniques like siphons and pour-overs and unique coffee drinks not available at your neighborhood Starbucks; technological wonder with massive roasting machines tended to by guys with huge beards and handlebar mustaches; laboratory with ornate cold-brew systems that look like something out of the mind of a mad scientist; a coffee museum with displays about coffee-growing regions and processing techniques. Imagine the coffee equivalent of a mashup between Walt Disney World and Studio 54, and you get the idea.![Reserve Roastery](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/Roastery650.B4bzkLgN_22VpjE.webp)_Starbucks Reserve Roastery_ The concept behind the Reserve Roastery stores is to return to what Howard Schultz talks about as the “theater of coffee.” These are meant to be destinations, not drive-throughs; places that emphasize coffee as an experience, not just a caffeine fix. I think there’s also an attempt to bring in consumers who feel Starbucks has gotten away from its original core commitment to quality coffee. The Reserve concept seeks to introduce consumers to a rotating array of small-lot coffees from places like Ethiopia, Jamaica, Brazil, and Guatemala.![Roasting Coffee at Starbucks Reserve](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/Roastery2_650.MWDpRd___1jbLiK.webp)_Roasting Coffee at Starbucks Reserve_ A major educational goal connects coffee drinkers with particular farms and farmers in ways that can’t happen when you order a Blonde Roast or Pike’s Place, which blends coffees from farms all over the world. The average Starbucks coffee is, to my tastes, over-roasted because the consistency of flavor is valued more than subtly. That’s simply the reality for a company that churns out four billion cups a year and wants that grande Verona blend you purchased at the Starbucks in Seattle to taste just like the Verona you ordered at the airport in Boston before you boarded the plane. As with everything Starbucks, just as many people will flock to the Reserve Roasteries as will condemn them, and in the end, Starbucks stockholders will be rewarded. ### Resources_Holy Grounds: The Surprising Connection Between Coffee and Faith — From Dancing Goats to Satan’s Drink_[Starbucks Coffee College](https://ineedcoffee.com/starbucks-coffee-college/) – INeedCoffee article about attending a coffee education program hosted by Starbucks.

# Vietnam: Silent Global Coffee Power [Coffee History](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/coffee-history/)---by [Alex Scofield](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/alex-scofield/)![Vietnam: Silent Global Coffee Power](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/vietnam-silent-global-coffee-power/vietnam-rice-paddy.jpg) When you think of major coffee countries, odds are that Vietnam does not jump to your mind. Yet in recent years, Vietnam has shot up through the world’s coffee exporting ranks, now second only to Brazil in tons of coffee exported nationally. This rapid rise from utter anonymity in the coffee-producing world to its current exporting prowess has put the country at the center of a global economic controversy, as countries from Colombia to Tanzania blame Vietnam for contributing to the swell of coffee supply and plummeting prices. No small fact, considering that coffee is the world’s second-most widely traded commodity, second only to petroleum, according to TechnoServe. Vietnam’s recent ascent into the coffee-growing world is not its first foray into the trade. Before the Vietnam war, it was a “major exporter,” according to Scott Wilson of the Washington Post. French colonists introduced coffee to the country’s central highlands region late in the 19th Century, and this proved to be a fertile area for growing coffee. Between the many years of war on its soil and the Communist government has ruled since, Vietnamese coffee exporting prowess became a thing of the past until the early 1980s, when it quietly reentered the global coffee market.![Vietnam Map](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/vietnam-map1.CmV03MZP_ZyPXkH.webp)_Vietnam Map_ Unlike Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, there has been no dramatic collapse of Communist rule in Vietnam. Instead, its Communist government has taken baby steps toward economic liberalization, described as a “somewhat Communist interpretation of its capitalist market economy” by Henry Kamm in _Dragon Ascending_. In step with the Soviet Union’s perestroika, Vietnam’s government permitted _doi moi_, the name for controlled measures of economic reform in the late 1980s. When the United States normalized diplomatic relations with Vietnam in 1995, the U.S. had already lifted trade sanctions with the country. National coffee production had been growing steadily by the mid-1990s, but now the stage was set for an agricultural gold rush. With global coffee prices at alluringly high levels, ever-increasing amounts of growth space in the highlands was devoted to coffee shrubs, where they had thrived decades before. Vietnam’s coffee output nearly tripled in four years, rising from 3,938 60 Kg bags of coffee exported in 1995 to 11,264 60 Kg bags in 1999, according to CoffeeResearch.org. Nearly all coffee grown in Vietnam is of the Robusta variety, one of the two principal species of coffee grown in the world, the other being Arabica. CoffeeResearch.org estimates that Robusta consists of less than one-fourth of the world’s coffee production, and describes it as “more robust than the Arabica plants, but produces an inferior tasting beverage with a higher caffeine content.” Coffee connoisseurs tend to agree with this assessment of Robusta as a standalone coffee, although allotting has its place in certain blends, especially in espresso. While by no means the only source of the global market flood, Vietnam has played a major role in the increase of global coffee supply, and the markets have taken notice. Prices of robusta coffee have plummeted in the 21st century – trading in the U.S. at $.054 per pound on the New York market in January 2000, robusta’s value had fallen nearly in half by March 2001, down to the U.S. $.031 per pound, according to CoffeeResearch.org. By May 2001, the International Coffee Association held a conference dedicated in part to address “the critical situation of the present world coffee market.” This “critical situation” has had a wide range of repercussions. Wilson’s article describes a scenario in which many Colombian coffee growers have switched to the more lucrative but less licit coca plant, unable any longer to turn a profit from growing coffee. The blunt reality of market forces has threatened to make coffee-growing an unprofitable venture all over Latin America. “Increasing numbers of coffee growers are losing money because revenues aren’t covering their production costs, and the situation is clearly not sustainable,” said Peter A. Reiling, President and CEO of TechnoServe, a Connecticut-based charity that works with developing countries. It is not only Vietnam’s economic rivals in the global market that have been impacted – Vietnam finds itself reeling from the repercussions of its hyperinflated coffee output. A press release from the Vietnamese Embassy to the U.S. says that in just over two years, the country’s coffee export prices had fallen 57 percent in the world market, and estimates that Vietnam’s farmers have lost a collective total of VND 15 billion from the decline in coffee and rice prices.![Vietnam Rice Paddy](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/vietnam-rice-paddy.naEuhMAF_Z1KfC0h.webp)_[Vietnam Rice Paddy](https://www.flickr.com/photos/chericbaker/4446191178/in/photostream/) by Eric Baker_ In order to address this issue, the Vietnamese government has purchased and stockpiled domestically grown coffee. Also, in August 2001, Vietnam signed the International Coffee Agreement at the United Nations headquarters in New York City. Even the Vietnamese government seems willing to concede that the nation’s coffee export, generally speaking, is of a lower grade than that of other countries. The aforementioned Vietnam Embassy press release admits that “for many years now, Viet Nam has paid more attention to increasing the number of farm products when it needed to pay more attention to their quality and world market demand.” Another Embassy article explains that the “wanton expansion of coffee plantations in Central Highlands Tay Nguyen with little regard for soil ecology resulted in coffee plant diseases and a low-quality bean that drove export prices down.” In a speech given to the International Coffee Association, Doan Trieu Nhan, Chairman of the Vietnam Coffee-Cocoa Association, described a state plan to diversify the country’s robusta-saturated coffee growth and output, growing more arabica in the northern region of the country. It is thus agreed upon domestically and internationally that Vietnam needs to attract the attention of premium coffee lovers. One of Vietnam’s domestic offerings, “weasel coffee,” has the potential to appeal to the palates of high-end drinkers the world over. Kay Johnson describes the colorful history of this drink in the Straits Times. Weasel coffee was originally made from coffee beans that had been eaten and excreted by weasels, enhancing the taste of the beans. A chain of coffee shops in Vietnam specializes in weasel coffee, although these days the beans never see a weasel’s insides, rather going through a synthetic process intended to simulate the effects of a journey through the weasel’s digestive tract. Apparently, it is as good as the real thing. While the owner of this chain has contemplated an international expansion of his business, citing possible franchises in Japan and New York City, the chain remains exclusively in Vietnam. ### Resources CoffeeResearch.org – Extensive online coffee reference site.

# West Bend Popper 2 Rewire for Coffee Roasting [Roasting Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/roasting-coffee/)---by [Sam Hampton](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/sam-hampton/)![West Bend Popper 2 Rewire for Coffee Roasting](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/west-bend-popper-2-rewire-coffee-roasting/wb-h-f.jpg) I was inspired to buy the [West Bend Poppery 1](https://ineedcoffee.com/roasting-coffee-in-a-popcorn-popper/) when I saw _willbldrco’s_ video on YouTube entitled _West Bend Poppery rewire for coffee roasting_. What a masterful modification to simply solve the coffee roasting routine by changing one wire to another terminal. By changing the fan wire to the hot terminal, so it would bypass the off-on switch and the fan would run all the time when the popper was plugged into the socket, is sheer genius. This means that the off-on switch, on the popper, can now be used to control the heat; thereby regulating the temperature and prolonging the roasting time of the beans. An even better solution was provided by Jim West in his West Bend Poppery 2 modification effort. He put the fan on a separate DC current circuit using a transformer from Radio Shack. This allowed the heat to be controlled by a router speed control unit from Harbor Freight. He separated the small heating coil and the main heating coil into one circuit and put the fan on the other transformer circuit. ### My Alternative Solution My alternative solution is to keep the small coil and the fan in one circuit; the small coil acts as a voltage reducer, and by isolating the Main heating coil in another circuit, the need for a transformer is eliminated. The fan and small coil will run when the circuit is plugged into the 120-volt outlet. The main heating coil will be wired into a separate circuit with its own plug-in wire that can be controlled with the Harbor Freight Router Speed Control, which is plugged into a separate 120-volt outlet. The photograph below shows the items needed to make the alternative conversion outlined above.![alternative conversion](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/wb-diy-setup.D1DumVQk_1T49en.webp) A $1.69 extension cord, after it is cut in half, will provide the new plug-in cord for the main heating coil. The black wire will provide a connection to one end of the main heating oil, and the small black shunt wire will bypass the thermal fuse, so the fan cannot be shut off by overheating. The rubber grommet for $ 0.70 will make a neat entry job for the new main heater cord. The two-wire connecting nuts will provide the connection to the Main heating coil wires. ### The Conversion This conversion will work not only on the West Bend Poppery 2 but on most of the [Presto hot air poppers](https://ineedcoffee.com/poplite-coffee-roaster/) with similar wiring. The one cautionary provision in this modification is to make sure the two circuits are completely separate. Some hot air poppers have a small coil connected directly to the main heating coil. If the popper is so wired, then the small coil must be separated from the main heating coil. It should be connected to a point somewhere on the fan circuit so it is in series with the current to supply power to the fan. This should only be attempted by someone who knows what they are doing.![convert popper](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/wb-hack-setup.6AYCzvyB_VFbxm.webp) The WB Poppery 2 is disassembled by removing three screws in the top cover of the popper. The power cord is removed by twisting the power cord keeper fitting 90 degrees to the right or left and then pulling it out. The cord keeper can be removed and saved for later re-assembly using the reverse procedure. The heating and fan unit are disassembled by removing three small screws that hold them together. When you have performed that task the internal working of the heating unit can be explored. Mark the orientation of the parts so that reassembly will be easier.![West Bend Label A](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/wb-label-A-650x487.DMt40eK8_4bBIx.webp) [Full size image](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/wb-label-A.jpg) Point A is the incoming 120-volt hot wire. The current moves from A through the Thermal Fuse to D to supply both the small and main heating coils. D is one end of the small heating coil, and E is the other end of the small heating coil. This supplies power to the fan. Current then runs down the brass strip from D to the thermostat and supplies current to C, which is one end of the main heating coil. By removing the top part of the thermostat (and the bi-metal disk), we isolate the two heating coils. The white ground wire is attached to the other end of the Main heating coil. It is cut from the incoming 120-volt ground connection. In the photograph below, before the removal of the thermostat tab, I propped open the thermostat contacts with a toothpick. I tested to make sure there was no contact between the two coils with a continuity meter. When the white ground wire to C has been clipped, the separation of the two coil circuits is complete. The fan and the small coil are on the original popper cord. The white wire at B and the new black wire at C will be attached to a new power cord to supply power to the Main heating coil.![West Bend B](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/wb-label-B-650x487.D91KuVbi_Z1gJuAC.webp) [Full size image](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/wb-label-B.jpg)![West Bend C](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/wb-label-C-650x487.CvVLnAxv_KvwoT.webp) [Full size image](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/wb-label-C.jpg) ### Near Completion There will be continuity between B and C. There should be **NO CONTINUITY** between B and/or C and any other points of the fan and small heating coil circuit. If this checks out, the heating and fan unit are now ready for reassembly. Take care to orient the two parts correctly when you reassemble them. In the photograph below, a hole has been drilled into the outer case of the West Bend Poppery 2, the rubber grommet inserted into the hole and the new Main Coil power cord threaded through.![West Bend cord label](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/wb-cord-label.DyLppFRr_ZqXU37.webp) The two main heater coil wires are connected to the new cord with wire nuts, and then the West Bend Poppery 2 unit is reassembled. The original power cord is refitted with its keeper plug. The wires are marked for heat and fan. ### Take Notice of This This unit is now unprotected from overheating. **Do not operate the Modified West** **Bend Poppery 2 without the fan plugged in and running**. The fan cord can be plugged directly into the 120-volt outlet. The heater cord can be plugged into the Router Speed Control. The router speed control can be plugged into a 120-volt outlet. If the heat is on for **5 seconds without the fan** on the West Bend Poppery 2 will **melt down and catch on fire. It will be trash or worse!** The unit has enough power to roast coffee with the fan on full power, and the heater coil operates at 50%, 75%, 87%, or 100% power. ### A Roast Profile to Start YOU off… I roast 90 grams of coffee beans in about 12 minutes. I apply full power to the fan for 2 to 4 minutes with no heat to pre-warm the beans and popper. Then I add heat at 75% for 4 minutes, and then I add heat at 87% for 4 minutes, and then I finish the roast at 100% power. I use a thermometer and usually roast to a city plus or full city level and stop the roast at 230 to 235 degrees C, just into the second crack. ### Once Again, Be Careful This unit can be **dangerous and will overheat and catch fire** if operated in a careless or unattended manner. This worked for me, and there are no guarantees or warranties. Be careful and study all the modifications and understand what you are doing before modifying any popper. Good luck and happy roasting.![holes labeled](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/wb-h-f.Bd8jiaxb_2ktovu.webp) ### Epilogue The Photograph below tells the story. If modified and used properly, you can enjoy many great cups of coffee, if not a lot of sadness and tears will fill your cup.![finished roast](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/wb-finished-roast.DFzgx6Xr_Z2rShFp.webp) The old saying that the proof is in the pudding comes to my mind. **You can roast coffee quite well in the West Bend Poppery 2 without modifying anything.** Slowing down the roasting speed is a challenge. This can be accomplished with the router speed control and a wooden spoon to stir the beans as they roast. Three tools I find indispensable are: 1. Router control 2. Flashlight 3. Chaff collector The router control and 4 outlet extension cord sit on my workbench for almost every project. I made the dimmer switch cord for about $10.00. It is a 600-watt dimmer switch and can handle video lights or the fan on a popper, but has limited use in controlling the heat, as it will only handle 5.5 amps.![router control](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/wb-dial.CCtM6g4E_ZiuSLF.webp) Another nice thing to have while roasting is a chaff catcher; it makes cleanup a lot easier. I used screen wire shaped in a circle to fit the diameter of the roasting chamber, and then I stapled it on the seam. The top of the catcher is attached with longer stripped wire strands from the screen wire.![chaff collector](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/wb-mesh-outside.DGmWxp6__27cliS.webp)![chaff collector inside](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/wb-mesh.BQFtVd43_Z1QMRbF.webp) Enjoy.

Very few customers usually get excited over cutting their coffee costs or giving them excellent service. The most exciting thing to them is making that _great cup of Joe_, become something more than ground coffee. Our company is very big on doing taste tests to ensure that the people drinking the coffee will be satisfied for a long time. We will usually do these taste tests in the morning time to help us get a better idea of the majority of the use. You can bring food, gifts, or coffee basket items to them, but nothing excites people like WHIPPED CREAM!![whipped cream drink](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/whipped-drink1.BjUPIoK3_Z1SCaEW.webp)_Whipped Cream Coffee Drink_ One day, I was doing a taste test for a company, and I was making a cup for the person in charge of making the decision for our services. I asked her, **“Would you like a $4 cup of coffee for about $0.10 cents?”** Of course, she said “yes!” I filled her cup first with a bottom layer of caramel syrup, and then I added a half cup of coffee. I then put 1/4 cup of cream on top and when I pulled the whipped cream out, she almost came unglued. > Oh my god!! Whipped cream! I can’t believe it! It is such a treat! I think I was shocked by her behavior more than anything else. She actually jumped up and down and went down the hall to get more people. She told them, “Look, he has whipped cream!” It was like we brought the party to the office. This went on for hours. That was the longest taste test I have ever been on, and we have received a great amount of business due to whipped cream. Try wooing your families and friends with this, and I would love to know your response. Isn’t it funny how the simple things in life make people joyful? Try it at a gathering of friends and family. You will be AMAZED!

The Stazione Centrale in Milano was my second home…and the trains I hopped on were my lifeline. The rumbling of the train, the sound of the steam-powered engines, and the rush I felt on each voyage: were the fuel that kept me going. Up in the morning and on my way…a quick cup of coffee (coffee is espresso, nothing else) down the hatch. My fuel, just like the train needed to plow its way through the Po Valley. Nothing like it! The marvelously designed Victoria Arduino espresso machine sitting at the Station. A looming hunk of polished metal, an eagle topped with wings spread wide and a face filled with determination. Here was the essence of modern urban life: motion, change, strength, and intensity. Forward-onward. Cup after cup…we were young, busy men with no time to spare. Now, 50 years later, I sit solidly, solidly in my small room, preparing a different cup. Alone with my few utensils, I sit and slowly grind the beans – freshly roasted. The same beans but a different brew, no longer spurting out of the fantasmographic espresso machine.![Coffee Grinder by Jaggu Prasad ](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/yellow-jacket2_300.EB1Jl8pv_Z1uh0pp.webp)_The painting Coffee Grinder by Jaggu Prasad (born 1963)_ Now, slowly and delicately, the bean and I go through the process… > _roasted in the flat iron pan.. room fills with smoke and heaviness metamorphising beans from green to brown intense aromas fill my nose._ Grinder held firmly between my knees, my large heavy hands slowly turning with the turning of time. Each bean cracks and turns to small particles plummeting into the wooden drawer. I turn into myself and appreciate the nuances: shades of brown, aromas, and the feel of the beans breaking down between the burrs of the grinder. The space between my arms, my knees, and my body was a cubic void, a gut of space, like the innards of the grinder itself. A pot on the fire gently brewing the coffee. Filling the room with new sensations that I absorb. Sitting on my low chair. Slowly ingesting the brew…cherishing each slurp that slides down my throat. Here, too, is a journey, intense movement. I am going nowhere special…just inward, wrapped in my yellow coat.

# Why Mormons Don’t Drink Coffee or Tea [Coffee History](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/coffee-history/)---by [Lura Lee](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/lura-lee/)![Why Mormons Don’t Drink Coffee or Tea](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/why-mormons-dont-drink-coffee-or-tea/why-mormons-do-not-drink-coffee.jpg) Have you noticed that most followers of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints (LDS), commonly called Mormons, don’t drink coffee or tea? You’ll see them enjoying herbal teas (tisanes), hot cider, and many true believers even drink caffeinated soda. The casual observer may jump to the conclusion that this is: 1. A law 2. It must have something to do with caffeine. Neither is accurate. This article explains in detail the historical significance, context, and modern interpretation of the prohibition/exhortation against coffee and tea for Mormons. ### The Word of Wisdom Followers of the LDS church believe in a book of scripture called The Book of Mormon, and the concept of continuous revelation. They believe that the Holy Spirit continues to communicate with humans. Thus, the prophet Joseph Smith received a spontaneous manifestation of God’s insight for living correctly on February 27, 1833. This insight was written down and incorporated into the Doctrines and Covenants of the Church; specifically, these insights are referred to as the Word of Wisdom. It may be an apocryphal story, but it is said that Joseph Smith was moved to ask for God’s insight on the matter of tobacco, and the revelation that resulted included guidance related to the use of tobacco, “warm drinks”,”strong drinks”, wine, meat, herbs, and grains. 1. A Word of Wisdom, for the benefit of the council of high priests, assembled in Kirtland, and the church, and also the saints in Zion- 2. To be sent greeting; not by commandment or constraint, but by revelation and the word of wisdom, showing forth the order and will of God in the temporal salvation of all saints in the last days 3. Given for a principle with promise, adapted to the capacity of the weak and the weakest of all saints, who are or can be called saints. 4. Behold, verily, thus saith the Lord unto you: In consequence of evils and designs which do and will exist in the hearts of conspiring men in the last days, I have warned you, and forewarn you, by giving unto you this word of wisdom by revelation- 5. That inasmuch as any man drinketh wine or strong drink among you, behold it is not good, neither meet in the sight of your Father, only in assembling yourselves together to offer up your sacraments before him. 6. And, behold, this should be wine, yea, pure wine of the grape of the vine, of your own make. 7. And, again, strong drinks are not for the belly, but for the washing of your bodies. 8. And again, tobacco is not for the body, neither for the belly, and is not good for man, but is an herb for bruises and all sick cattle, to be used with judgment and skill. 9. **And again, hot drinks are not for the body or belly.**10. And again, verily I say unto you, all wholesome herbs God hath ordained for the constitution, nature, and use of man- 11. Every herb in the season thereof, and every fruit in the season thereof; all these to be used with prudence and thanksgiving. The common hot drinks of the time were coffee and tea. But this was a dietary shift for Joseph Smith’s contemporaries, the generation of Mormon Pioneers. ### Mormon Pioneers Mormon pioneers had a relatively high literacy rate compared to other people around the world in the 1830s – 1850s. To a large extent, this can be attributed to the fact that they had Protestant roots and they needed to read Scripture in order to properly practice their religious beliefs. Keep in mind that the United States at this time had no federal program of education for its citizenry. Most states and municipalities didn’t either. Compulsory, standardized, universal education was a reform of the early 1900s. Still, many of the middle-class pioneers were literate, kept diaries, and read guidebooks prior to embarking on the overland journey west to Utah, which came to be known as the Mormon Trail. The most popular books of the time were: William Clayton’s **The Latter Day Saint’s Emigrant’s Guide** (1848), and Joseph Ware’s **The Emigrant’s Guide to California** (1849). All of the guides of the time included recommendations for provisioning the wagons. For example, Andrew Child’s **Overland Route** guidebook included food recommendations for three men, including 50 pounds of coffee and 2 pounds of tea. Even the LDS leadership recommended packing coffee, tea, and alcohol for the 1846 overland journey. But while they were packing the wagons, they may have contemplated the advantages of quitting any coffee or tea habit they had acquired while living in Illinois. They were fleeing religious persecution, after all, so they intended to minimize contact with non-believers, and coffee and tea won’t grow in Utah. So, to some extent, the rejection of tea and coffee amongst the Mormon Pioneers was a mechanism for building Mormon identity at the most basic, formative, constitutive level. ### Next to Godliness? The current debate over coffee, tea, caffeine, and other “hot drinks” boils down to a difference in interpretation about whether this particular portion of the Doctrines and Covenants is an outright prohibition or merely counsel. During the Temperance movement years, the Mormons referred to the Word of Wisdom to eschew alcohol consumption and became associated with strict Prohibition reform. Around 1921, the Mormon Church switched from the use of wine in religious ceremonies to water. Today, it seems that full participation in the Church (participation in the Mormon Temple) is granted to those who are strict adherents to the Words of Wisdom. But there is still room for debate on the specifics of what it means to “strictly” adhere to the tenets of the Words of Wisdom. Even today, there is a lot of discussion about whether it is just coffee and tea, whether cola is ok, whether decaf coffee and tea are ok, etc. Essentially, the Church leaders recommend the rejection of any drink that might be habit-forming. “With reference to cola drinks, the Church has never officially taken a position on this matter, but the leaders of the Church have advised, and we do now specifically advise, against the use of any drink containing harmful habit-forming drugs under circumstances that would result in acquiring the habit. Any beverage that contains ingredients harmful to the body should be avoided.”(Clifford J. Stratton, “Caffeine–The Subtle Addiction,” Tambuli, Mar. 1990, 25) Now, coffee is seen as part of that slippery slope that leads away from God. Coffee, booze, marijuana, cocaine… all a defilement of the temple that God gave us. ### If Not Coffee — What? So, in lieu of coffee, what hot beverages do Mormons enjoy? Well, they used to drink Postum. They were crazy for Postum. Postum was a roasted grain and molasses drink produced by Kraft Foods. It was discontinued from production in 2007. Mormons also favor the following drinks served both warm and cold: herbal tinctures, milk, and non-alcoholic apple drinks. They also enjoy Italian sodas, fruit drinks, and milkshakes. ### Will the Next President Drink Coffee? Presidential Candidate Mitt Romney isn’t interested in highlighting the differences between the LDS Church and other Christians. So he holds meet-n-greets in coffee shops where no one bothers to ask what’s in the coffee mug.![Mitt Romney coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/MittRomney1.B55Cc1NY_TXtDe.webp)_Does Mitt Romney drink coffee?_**2011 Update:** The site MittRomneyCentral.com _(offline as of 2017)_ posted a photo of Mitt Romney at a Tampa coffee shop in front of a coffee mug.

It was confirmed that Mitt Romney **did not drink coffee** during his visit.![Mitt Romney at Buddy Brew](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/romney-buddy-coffee.CJGr1vMd_ZcLJDg.webp)_Mitt Romney at Buddy Brew Coffee in Tampa, Florida._### Separate but Together To a large extent the Mormon decision to not drink coffee or tea is born out of a desire to separate from the common, everyday world. Mormons separate from worldly temptations in order to be closer to God. They also separate from other Christians, Muslims, and Jews in order to bind to one another and establish an identity as a group. One tangible way in which they are separate but together is through the tradition of abstaining from coffee and tea. ### Resources [Doctrine and Covenants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctrine_and_Covenants) – Wikipedia_Title Photo by [Jesse Gardner](https://unsplash.com/@plasticmind)_ Published on December 27, 2011--- #### Lura Lee Lura Lee enjoys coffee, but no longer pursues coffee as a hobby.

# Why Home Roast Coffee? [Roasting Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/roasting-coffee/)---by [Ryan Jacobs](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/ryan-jacobs/)![Why Home Roast Coffee?](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/why-home-roast/green-coffee-beans1.jpg) Roasting your own coffee may seem difficult, troublesome, or even a ridiculous notion. I contend that it is neither difficult nor troublesome, and the only thing ridiculous is settling for less than the best coffee possible. There are so many reasons to roast your own coffee, but I will summarize what I think are the most compelling reasons. ### The Freshness Personally, I think the best reason for home roasting is that you have full control over the freshness level of your coffee. Having coffee at its freshest really makes a huge difference in the quality of the cup you will drink. I liken it to the difference between home-baked cookies and store-bought cookies. I guarantee that the first batch of coffee you roast in your home will taste better than the coffee roasted in Seattle two or more weeks ago or even that of your local coffee supplier. Also, consider this: right now you probably buy your coffee by the pound, so you only get to enjoy one type of coffee at a time. If you roast your own coffee, you can buy many different types and blends of green coffee. Green coffee is very easy to store, and since you can roast small batches, you can literally try a fresh, new roast each day.![Green Coffee Beans](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/green-coffee-beans-economics1.7Is0k-6V_Z20UIVJ.webp)_Green coffee_### Home Coffee Roasting is Easy Roasting coffee is easier than you can possibly imagine. It has been compared to boiling water or toasting bread. Just buy a small batch of green beans over the internet and locate a few, common household items. Once you have your supplies, you can have freshly roasted coffee within 5-15 minutes, depending on the roasting method and roast preference. ### Home Coffee Roasting is Economical Green, unroasted, coffee beans generally cost half the price of what you would pay for the same kind of bean roasted. If you are an avid coffee drinker, you can really save money by roasting your own. Furthermore, unlike homebrewing kits or bread machines, you don’t have to make a large equipment investment. I started home roasting by purchasing a West Bend Poppery II hot air popcorn machine. They retail for around $20 US. There are more advanced roasting devices that you can invest in, but you’ll get great coffee from any of the available roasting methods. ### Home Coffee Roasting is a Great Hobby Roasting coffee is a great hobby to explore. With the huge variety of coffees available, crop variations, and roasting levels, a person can dedicate a lifetime to the pursuit of coffee knowledge. With home roasting as your hobby, you can explore the artistry of creating new coffee blends, and designing roasting equipment and/or modifications. The home roasting community is quite friendly and very, very active. This is really helpful as you become more involved in roasting and want to learn ways to fine-tune your craft. There are websites, newsgroups, and books dedicated to home roasting. Of particular interest is the Home Coffee Roasting Mailing List at Sweet Maria’s. Sweet Maria’s is regarded as the premier resource for the home coffee roaster. In addition to home roasting equipment, you can find a huge selection of green beans available for sale in small batches for very reasonable prices.![Whirley Pop Popcorn Popper](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/whirley-pop-popcorn-roaster.CU3X-bti_Z1Nkprd.webp)_One option is to roast coffee using a Whirley Pop on the stovetop._### Impress Your Friends If nothing else, roasting coffee will impress your friends. Bringing homemade bread, homemade cookies, or even homemade beer to a party will most certainly be appreciated and enjoyed by guests. So will home-roasted coffee. When you present your friends with the freshest coffee that they have ever tasted, they will most certainly enjoy it and they are sure to hold you in high esteem. A word of warning, though: the price of this reverence is the expectation and anticipation that you will roast again and again. ### Resources [Roasting Coffee in a Popcorn Popper](https://ineedcoffee.com/roasting-coffee-in-a-popcorn-popper/) – INeedCoffee tutorial.

# Winter Home Roasting [Roasting Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/roasting-coffee/)---by [Ryan Jacobs](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/ryan-jacobs/)![Winter Home Roasting](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/winter-home-roasting/cold_diagram2.jpg) In the article [Roast Your Own](https://ineedcoffee.com/roast-your-own-coffee/), I showed you how easy it is to home roast coffee using a popcorn popper, but I didn’t mention the popper roaster’s nemesis: Old Man Winter. Cold winds and bitter temperatures have a negative impact on outdoor roasting in a popper. Coffee roasting requires a high temperature and when the cold winds start whipping around the machine, the coffee beans are cooled. The lower the roast temperature, the longer the roast will take. There are many good aspects of slow-roasted coffee, but cold temperatures can be deadly to your roasting efforts. Simply put: if the roast gets too cold and takes too long the final result will be unpalatable coffee. Should we give up on home roasting during the winter? Should we deprive ourselves of fresh home roasted coffee? NO! My goal was to devise a method to fight off the cold temperatures and roast great-tasting coffee. For this article, I had a fellow roaster in San Diego, California roast the exact same type of coffee bean as I roasted in Columbus, Ohio. Could I get the same roasting times in a sub-freezing environment as I could on a sunny day in California? ### Coffee Roasting: Warm Weather vs Cold Weather Roasting Brazil Cerrado Monte Carmelo with West Bend Poppery II in Columbus and San Diego yielded different results. Columbus was 22 F with a 14 MPH wind, while San Diego was 68 F with a 5 MPH wind. The roast in San Diego achieved the first crack at 4 minutes and 30 seconds. Due to the extreme cold environment, the Columbus roast never even got to the first crack.![Cold Weather Coffee Roasting](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/the_challenge1.AdziSpja_Z1eqzEj.webp)_Cold Weather Coffee Roasting_### A Ruined Batch To demonstrate what it is like trying to roast coffee in the cold without modifying the environment or popper, I did a sample batch, taking pictures along the way. As you can see from the pictures, trying to roast without controlling the environmental factors was disastrous. The extremely cold weather is just too much for this little popper to handle. It can’t heat the ambient cold air fast enough to roast the coffee beans effectively.![4.5 minutes into a cold roast](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/reg_4_30.Bo2o7fLp_mTl2d.webp)_4.5 minutes into a cold roast_![11 minutes](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/reg_11.Z2QjVz7t_1IHCBp.webp)_At 11 minutes, this roast is hopeless._ The result was completely unacceptable. By the 11-minute mark, these coffee beans were unevenly roasted and they had only reached a cinnamon roast. The roast was uninspiring and I knew better than to brew and taste the lifeless coffee. But even more unacceptable to me was the notion that I could not roast during the winter. I decided to modify the roasting conditions in an effort to control the ambient temperature. ### The Modification![Normal coffee roasting in cold temperatures](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/cold_diagram1.D75hQEX1_JrPsW.webp)_Normal coffee roasting in cold temperatures_![Popper in box](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/cold_diagram2.BazzsEDX_1Mj5ul.webp)_Popper in a box – Roasting in cold Temperatures_ My modification ideas were simple: if I could trap the warm air and recycle it, I could simulate a warm environment.![box roasting](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/inbox_begin.BNg2XSzq_ZcB1YM.webp)_A box serves as a windbreaker when coffee roasting in the cold._![cold weather roasting in box](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/in_box_Profile.Cf3gEMUD_2c0VBc.webp)_Use the hood and box flap to redirect hot air._ I knew that I had to stop the wind from entering the popper’s air intake fan in order to get a good roast. I began the roast by placing the popper inside a slightly larger box. In fact, I used the original box in which the popper was purchased. This successfully shielded the popper from the wind. I waited until the chaff blew off the beans. Also around this time, the beans stop spinning and begin to jump in the roaster. Then I made my second set of modifications. The second set of modifications was intended to trap the warm air as much as possible. I added the popper’s hood attachment. This directed the hot air down into the box. I also lifted the box flap so as to further capture the hot air. ### Results After making the modifications, the results were impressive. I was able to roast the coffee in an acceptable amount of time. I reached the first crack reached at 4 1/4 minutes into the roast. A second crack began at about the time that I decided to stop roasting: at 7 1/4 minutes. These times are roughly equivalent to those achieved in warm weather.![7 minutes in box](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/in_box_result225x180.C9-XJOg8_Zf3OJQ.webp)_Results after modification (7 1/4 minutes)_![11 minutes no box](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/regular_result225x180.1T1aWM2c_Z1cjjI6.webp)_Results without modification (11 1/2 minutes)_### Summary By using a cardboard box and the popper’s hood attachment, I was able to ward off Old Man Winter and roast my coffee outdoors. These are probably some of the simplest modifications that you can make, but they proved very safe and effective. There are other ideas for conquering the cold weather; just [don’t use a space heater](https://ineedcoffee.com/cold-weather-coffee-roasting/). Armed with this information, I encourage all of my fellow popper roasters living in cold climates to don their winter coat and roast some coffee.

# What Coffee Are You? Your Preference Says a Lot About You [Cafe Culture](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/cafe-culture/)---by [Samantha Thomas](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/samantha-thomas/)![What Coffee Are You? Your Preference Says a Lot About You](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/what-flavor-are-you-your-preference-in-coffee-says-a-lot-about-you/What-Coffee-Are-You.jpg) Do you like a foamy dainty cup of the steaming delight, or can’t say no to a tall hot mug of black coffee in the morning? Even scientists agree, that your choice of beverage says a lot about your personality, mood, and behavior. Those who like their latte sweet are friendly and caring by nature while those who think a foamy latte is their favorite tend to have a strong opinion on everything they care about. So what’s your style and what does your favorite cup of coffee say about you? Here are my thoughts on the subject. And yes, this is just my personal opinion and observation and is not based on any scientific research for study! ### Cappuccino You like your coffee frothy, and milky and in real life too, you enjoy the little pleasures of life to their fullest. Cappuccino is usually the first type of coffee that people start with, and many religiously end up having it as their morning essential. Cappuccino drinkers also like to soften the bitterness of coffee and don’t always care about themselves and instead go out of the way for others.![Cappuccino](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/cappuccino-coffee.FOVJsOST_1nL4HF.webp) ### Espresso Your no-nonsense, purist, and sensible personality sets you apart. Just like your coffee, you are straightforward, patient, and efficient, and like to always keep things simple. However, you can also be resistant to change and even act moody and abrupt at times.![](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/espresso-street-bean.Ba4SLf9A_1WWQPK.webp)_Street Bean Espresso by INeedCoffee_### Latte One of the most-loved forms of coffee, the Latte is highly preferred, and latte-lovers are great friends and fun to be with. They are also known to be generous with their time.![](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/latte-etching.CyNROj6T_23hjKa.webp)_[Latte Art Etching](https://ineedcoffee.com/latte-art-etching-photo-gallery/) by INeedCoffee_### Mocha Mocha is a close cousin of both coffee and hot chocolate. Mocha drinkers are perfectionists, trendsetters, and spontaneous. Mocha has a sweet and bitter chocolate flavor and people who regard mocha as their favorite flavor of coffee also like the blend of sweet and bitter in their lives.![](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/mocha.C4s4PkQs_Z2vU5SE.webp)_Cafe Cuzco Mocha by INeedCoffee_### Latte Macchiato Strong, distinct, and intense, the Latte Macchiato is an experimental blend of coffee that partners richness and originality all in one. Latte macchiato is an unconventional choice of coffee and is a lot like the original bitter black coffee. If that’s what you order, it depicts a strong, headfast, and purist personality. ### Americano You love to aim high and have high aspirations in life. Your choice of pure and honest flavors is evident in your personality as well.![McCafe in Thailand](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/mccafe-americano-thailand.Cy55ZRYO_Z211AMs.webp)_[Americano in Thailand](https://criticalmas.org/2010/05/sleepy-starbucks-and-caffeinated-sins-in-phuket-thailand/) by MAS_ Interesting results, don’t you agree?

# Why We Hate Starbucks [Coffee Business](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/coffee-business/)---by [Sebastian Little](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/sebastian-little/)![Why We Hate Starbucks](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/why-we-hate-starbucks/sb_china1.jpg) Starbucks is the megalithic corporate coffee company that is on literally every street in its birthplace, downtown Seattle. Starbucks is an international phenomenon with nearly 11,000 stores and 6.4 billion dollars in revenue last year. The company can move swiftly and forcefully into new products as it did when it bought Tazo Tea in 1999. The power of market domination allows them to simply buy out their competition when they wish as they did with Torrefazione and Seattle’s Best in 2003. They can dominate green coffee bean markets with their substantial buying power and leverage. Starbucks (like Microsoft just across Lake Washington) is in the paradoxical position of enjoying market supremacy and broad disdain at the same time. From labor issues to fair trade to ‘promoting homosexuality’ to charges of homogenization they are under constant scrutiny and criticism.![Starbucks located in the Palace Museum](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/sb_china1.qbEItJpt_Z2v9nj4.webp)_Starbucks located in the Palace Museum (“Forbidden City”), Beijing, Peoples Republic of China. Photo was taken by Larry Finch._ They are often the subject of parody (not laughing at themselves). When Steve Martin’s L.A. Story (1991) character orders his coffee “I’ll have a half double decaffeinated half-caf, with a twist of lemon” it was a direct hit on the absurd new coffee culture. And, remember the [2000 _Consumer Whore_](https://www.printmag.com/branding-identity-design/starbucks-design-starbung-wars-and-consumer-whores/) logo by cartoonist Kieron Dwyer. Starbucks sued Dwyer for his work and the case was settled. ### Why you are right to hate Starbucks (or at least resent them). Starbucks is hell-bent on world domination. When a new Starbucks springs up in your neighborhood the old coffee shop may not survive (but also may benefit). The indy shop will have to rally for customer loyalty. As a bi-product of the new Starbucks, they may find their rents going up as well. A well-run indy shop can make it right next door to a Starbucks – but not every time. Other signs of vanity are the forays into music, product placement in media, and now movie promotion. “Will that be a Tall, Grande, or a Venti?” Starbucks’ menu language is just stupid – especially for espresso drinks. All I have to say is “tall” is small. The barista or cashier will not speak to you in a normal cafe speak either… If you order a double cappuccino, you get the most dreaded question of all – “Will that be a Tall, Grande, or a Venti?” Fair Traders Cry “Foul!” After getting drummed by activists, S.B. did add fair trade options to the lineup. They claim to pay near fair trade prices for most of the beans they buy and I believe that. However, Fair Trade is a movement that deserves the kind of support that Starbucks is really capable of. “Line up, suckers.” If the long lines out the door were for being so great and so popular that would be fine. But, the sad fact is that they purposefully designed the shop layout to encourage snaking lines to create a sense of excitement, and encourage the sheep mentality in consumers. For people who pay attention to this stuff, it shows a lack of respect for the customer. ### Why should you love Starbucks (or at least not hate it)? An American Success Story, Starbucks was opened in 1971 by 3 partners (school teachers) who had a simple mission to bring great coffee and espresso to their town (these original partners later sold their stake and purchased Peet’s). The growth and proliferation of the company are simply admirable. The fact is that a lot of the anti-Starbucks sentiment is green envy. Need a good cup of Joe? When I visit my in-laws in a suburb of San Diego I thank Poseidon for the Starbucks mermaid in the strip mall just a block away. The closest independent operator is several miles away and frankly, they have bad products and poor service. Starbucks is served on airlines, in restaurants, and at events that likely would have used something far worse.![Starbucks in Glasgow](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/scotland.DGEy6Jct_ytjdA.webp)_Photo By [Jim J.](http://www.flickr.com/photos/11358744@N06/1099021236/) of Colorado Springs taken inside a Starbucks in Glasgow, Scotland._ Starbucks is a catalyst for an industrial revolution. The coffee industry has been revolutionized in no small part due to the standards set and held by Starbucks. In the early days of the specialty coffee movement, Starbucks was the best quality and highest style coffee outlet (unless you had an old Italian community in your city). Today, in contrast, independent shops and roasters produce higher quality and more interesting products, ultimately benefiting the consumer. This conversation is ongoing in the specialty coffee industry. There are many loving fawning and loyal fans of Starbucks. [One guy](https://ineedcoffee.com/winter-coffee-achiever/ "Winter") is trying to visit every Starbucks on the Planet. _But they are all the same, right?_ Most consumers love Starbucks less as they learn more about coffee cultivation & roasting. They want to explore more interesting and inventive coffee blends. Like most things, Starbucks is not all good or all bad but capable of both. Published on February 1, 2006--- #### Sebastian Little

# Winter: Coffee Achiever [Coffee People](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/coffee-people/)---by [Alex Scofield](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/alex-scofield/)![Winter: Coffee Achiever](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/winter-coffee-achiever/winter-starbucks-coffee1.jpg) When Winter saw Memorial Day fast approaching on his calendar, it quickly triggered a thought: “I hate to waste a three-day weekend.” For Winter, making the most of the weekend will entail hopping into his ’97 Integra and cruising out of his hometown in Plano, Texas, visiting as many Starbucks cafes as humanly possible. As he speculates on the possibilities, Winter estimates that he can reach California and return to Texas in time to return to his work as a computer programmer, all in three days’ time. So who exactly qualifies as a Coffee Achiever? Winter may be the textbook example of one, having visited 2830 of some 3352 Starbucks cafes in North America, according to his estimates. It is his routine to drink a half-cup of coffee at each Starbucks he visits, and he customarily photographs each cafe as well. On a day when Winter visits 30 Starbucks (it’s happened), his work is cut out for him. His photos from these journeys are online at his site, [StarbucksEverywhere.net](http://www.starbuckseverywhere.net/), the compilation of a Coffee Achiever’s travels.![Winter - Coffee Achiever](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/winter-starbucks-coffee1.Qt0SArWa_1bg0k8.webp)_Winter – Coffee Achiever_### Mermaid’s Conception A longtime lover of road trips, Winter had long been willing to cruise a good distance for his favorite concerts, and he fondly remembers Lillith Fair acts and REM shows that he traveled a good distance to see. Winter’s fondness for travel, paired with his fondness for hanging out at El Plano’s first Starbucks, helped plant the idea for the hobby that would follow. > “[I]t had to do with discussions… of how quickly Starbucks was growing and how they hoped to have 2000 locals by the year 2000. At some point I, or somebody there, wondered out look how neat it might be to try to visit them all.” “It was back in ’97 when I conceived of the idea,” said Winter, now 30 years old. “I wasn’t photographing them; I was just keeping a list.” “Traveling and visiting new places is definitely a big attraction,” said Winter. Another favorite element is “the driving. I really don’t get bored all that much… The miles just seem to go by pretty easily.” ### Mocha Freeze-Frame The photos that adorn Winter’s website have not always been part of the process. It was approximately two years after he began visiting Starbucks with a vengeance that he began to photograph them on a regular basis. > “I rediscovered my old love of photography,” said Winter. “I took about 8,000 photos between high school and college… I began to see that Starbucks didn’t all look alike and were actually worth photographing.” Photographing the Starbucks remains secondary to visiting them and drinking the coffee, Winter emphasizes. While he considers composition and lighting when taking his pictures, he does not believe that the artistic element is exactly his forte. > “I’ve got a lot of work to do there,” he says concerning photography. “I’ve never taken an art class.” ### Keeping a Frantic Pace Winter’s travels are not for the faint of heart, involving a lot of caffeine, a lot of driving, and often very little sleep. He visited approximately 400 Starbucks franchises during a three-week road trip that ranged from Houston, Texas, to Freeport, Maine, to Savannah, Ga., to Jacksonville, Fla., to Chicago, Ill. Winter doesn’t make it easy on himself, either, preferring to go out of his way to visit a smaller town’s lone Starbucks rather than numerous ones in the same city.![Big River Oaks II - Houston by Winter](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/river-oaks-starbucks.Y5fc93Go_Z20xMzO.webp)_Big River Oaks II – Houston by Winter_ How does he maintain this pace? With a road lifestyle far different from the routines of home – while Winter will sleep nine or ten hours each night at home, he has gone for several days at a time on two or three hours sleep per night on some of his voyages. > “I’ve crashed at a rest stop at 3 a.m., waken up at 5, and been back on the road,” said Winter. “I suffer for it; I can get some really intense headaches.” Starbucks Everywhere FAQ Many are curious how Winter can keep pace with the rapidly expanding franchise, and wonder whether he visits each and every Starbucks cafe in Barnes & Noble bookstores, for instance. Winter’s site, however, comes with a FAQ that has anticipated such questions. From his FAQ: > “I’m only interested in visiting locations owned and operated in whole or in part by Starbucks corporation. Albertson’s locations are called licensed stores, or business affiliates, and they are run by the grocery store. Barnes & Noble Cafes are not even that–they just serve the coffee. Now, some B&N locations do have a Starbucks proper attached, and those do count.” ### Conclusion Winter’s somewhat Warholian hobby has brought him a measure of fame in recent months. He has been profiled in an AP story and was subsequently interviewed by about 30 radio stations. Unaffiliated with Starbucks (save a brief stint working at one part-time), Winter is nonetheless happy to see that those in Seattle and elsewhere are beginning to take notice of his ambitious travel theme. Capable of downing dozens of cups of coffee a day, in near-perpetual motion, and devoted to accomplishing an unprecedented feat, Winter is highly deserving of INeedCoffee’s recognition as a true Coffee Achiever.**UPDATE:** [Winter: Coffee Achiever 2.0](https://ineedcoffee.com/winter-coffee-achiever-2-0/)**UPDATE March 2021:** The Starbucks Everywhere FAQ is no longer online.

# Winter: Coffee Achiever 2.0 [Coffee People](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/coffee-people/)---by [Alex Scofield](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/alex-scofield/)![Winter: Coffee Achiever 2.0](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/winter-coffee-achiever-2-0/dvd-starbucking-winter1.jpg) ### Winter: Minor Celebrity, Major Coffee Achiever Only two people have ever recognized Winter on sight. So when somebody refers to Winter as a celebrity, he’s quick with a clarification – he is, in his own words, a “minor celebrity.” When Winter walks up to the counter at a Starbucks and tells the barista why he’s there, that’s when there’s the flash of recognition. Nearly half of them have heard of Winter and his project. This is the guy who is trying to visit every Starbucks. “People are fascinated by something that’s so radically different from what they’re used to,” Winter said. The Starbucks you habituate? If you live in North America, the odds are a bit better than 92 percent that Winter’s been there, downed half a tall cup (4 ounces of the Coffee of the Day), and snapped a photo of the cafe that he’s posted on his website, [Starbuckseverywhere.net](http://Starbuckseverywhere.net). He’s been to 6,900 Starbucks, and 10 years after this endeavor began, he travels at a faster clip than ever before. In recent months, his mission is twofold – he continues to visit new locations, while promoting the April 2007 DVD release of “ [Starbucking](https://ineedcoffee.com/starbucking-honest-artistry/),” a documentary in which Winter stars and has a 25 percent stake in the profits. “[The trips] are enjoyable but … many more of the trips I’ve taken have an air of work about them because they’re so rushed,” Winter said. “I’ve found myself … rushing more than I used to.” Between the new media and the old, word gets out about Winter. His own website goes into rich detail chronicling his travels. Its links are testimony to the curiosity people have in his hobby. Winter has been the subject of dozens of articles in recent years, in hard-copy newspapers, on websites, and on the AP wire. He’s been interviewed on more radio stations than he can count, on CNN, FOX News, and the Wayne Brady Show; several of these interviews are on Youtube. The Internet Era and the Starbucks Era have combined to elevate Winter to a “minor celebrity” status that is unique to these times. Winter is never really “under the radar” of celebrity, but not squarely on it, either.![DVD starbucking winter](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/dvd-starbucking-winter1.CXcH82tZ_NOJaC.webp) ### Don Quixote, Sisyphus, or None of the Above? Fred Marion of Cox News Service called Winter “a modern-day Sisyphus.” For the most part, Winter agrees with the description. In 2002, he estimates he’d been to nearly 98 percent of all the Starbucks that then existed. The problem, of course, is that new Starbucks keeps opening up at warp speed. The chain expands faster than Winter can visit the new ones. The raw number of cafes Winter has visited keeps climbing, but the percentage plateaus. In the past five years, Winter estimates that he’s hovered between the 92 percent and 97 percent marks. He no longer plans on going to every Starbucks in the world — the chain’s proliferation abroad has made it just about impossible. “Internationally, I can’t even hope to keep it up,” Winter said. “All I can hope to do is the highest number possible.” In North America? That, Winter believes, could be done one day. He’s hoping that the pace of his “Starbucking” promotional tour will bring him back to the 99 percent mark. But somewhat surprisingly, Winter isn’t obsessed with reaching 100 percent. “I know that I could do it,” he said. “But nothing will happen if I do. Nothing magical will happen when I do it.” ### A Philosophical Turn Now that Winter has your attention, he’d like you to know something. “One big shift in my mind is that I’m now more interested in my philosophy,” Winter said. “I’m hoping that in my next job I can find some time to do more writing, not Starbucks travel so much.” His writing will center on his own philosophy, which, though articulated on his website, remains a work in progress. “Hopefully I will motivate myself to make that stuff coherent,” he said. As Winter sharpens his worldview he thinks everybody else should, too. “Any kind of philosophy would do a lot of people a lot of good,” Winter said. He feels fortunate that his high school taught philosophy, and he hopes that in upcoming years he will have time to reacquaint himself with some of the classic philosophers. Winter describes some of his personal philosophy in “Starbucking.” Summarizing it in a recent interview, Winter said, “Mankind in the 21st century should have a level of technology that obviates the need to work for survival. All people’s basic needs should be taken care of … thus freeing them up to pursue something higher, whether artistic or personal ambition or something scientific.” For the most part, Winter said, his Starbucks travel obsession and his philosophy are separate from one another. If there is any overlap, it lies in the fact that his Starbucks travels are something wholly different from mere survival. Winter Starbucks because he wants to; the hobby is entirely unique to him. When most of us think of a Starbucks cafe, we think of a few (OK, maybe a dozen or two) locations in our area. Perhaps a few near our home, perhaps a few near where we work. Winter hopes he will never view it that way. “I could never be satisfied being in one place,” Winter said. He moved out of his apartment in Plano, Texas in 1999, and he’s rarely put his roots down anywhere since. It’s the way he prefers it. He works on medium-term computer programming contracts, which ideally leave him several months each year to pursue his Starbucking road trips. “I’ve experienced so many cool cities traveling across the country that I want to continue experiencing them on a regular basis,” Winter said. Winter hopes that the release of the DVD “Starbucking,” combined with increased media attention, will draw more interest to his website, especially the link about his philosophy. It is this direction – the philosophical one – that he hopes his life will take in upcoming years. ### Keep on Starbuckin’ Winter doesn’t plan on stopping his Starbucks road trips any time soon. On the 10-year anniversary of his grand Starbucks scheme, he says he’s nearly certain it will last at least five years more; he can easily see it going another 10 years from this point. In 2002, INeedCoffee saluted [Winter as a Coffee Achiever](https://ineedcoffee.com/winter-coffee-achiever/). Upon the DVD release of “Starbucking,” we now give him an unprecedented second tribute as a Coffee Achiever. So many stars have aligned to make him the “minor celebrity” he claims to be – the Internet Era, the international Starbucks explosion, and the 21st-century economy that enables Winter to support his travels. As Winter closes in on his 7,000th Starbucks visit, the 28,000 ounces of coffee he’s consumed along the way mean his credentials as a Coffee Achiever simply cannot be questioned.

# Your Brain on Coffee: How Caffeine Affects Brain Chemistry [Coffee and Health](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/coffee-health/)---by [Bethany Ramos](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/bethany-ramos/)![Your Brain on Coffee: How Caffeine Affects Brain Chemistry](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/your-brain-on-coffee-how-caffeine-affects-brain-chemistry/brain-caffeine.jpg) In your love affair with coffee, have you ever struggled with a pesky caffeine crash mid-afternoon? For most of us, this mid-afternoon slump is the perfect time to reach for yet another cup of Joe to keep energy levels high so that we can make it through the rest of the workday. Although coffee has been proven to be a modern-day elixir with a long list of health benefits, that still doesn’t answer the question of how caffeine affects your brain day in and day out. ### Caffeine in the US and Beyond Today, up to 90% of Americans drink some form of caffeine each day. Roughly 50% of us drink up to 300 mg of caffeine daily, making it the most popular drug of choice in the US. If you think that our nation has some unhealthy caffeine habits, think again. The most caffeine per capita is consumed in Scandinavia, due in part to harsh winters and long nights. While cold countries seem to be some of the biggest coffee fans out there, Brazil, the largest coffee producer in the world, has begun to serve school-age children coffee with milk in their school lunches. ### What’s Behind a Coffee Craving Although coffee is a staple in a number of cultures, it can easily become an accepted addiction, where you crave a piping hot cup of Joe each day. Researchers confirm that those of us who are addicted to caffeine are naturally low in catecholamines, chemicals found in the brain that supports energy and alertness throughout the day.![Drink More Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/drink-more-coffee1.CqfE5nm7_2rF5NH.webp)_Drink More Coffee – El Diablo Coffee, Seattle, USA_ The moment we take that first sip of coffee, caffeine quickly moves through the bloodstream and triggers a release of catecholamines, adrenaline, and noradrenaline. At the same time, caffeine in coffee suppresses the appetite, inhibiting the body’s ability to produce more neurotransmitters. As a result, coffee provides a short-term solution that creates a long-term problem. ### How Caffeine Affects Brain Chemistry Caffeine impacts brain chemistry because it binds to proteins called adenosine receptors. Just like they sound, these receptors help to detect adenosine in the brain and can induce drowsiness. When caffeine binds to these receptors, it hinders brain cells from sensing adenosine to provide an immediate jolt and temporarily eliminate drowsiness. This is precisely why so many of us are drawn to caffeine to stay awake throughout a long day. Caffeine has been proven to boost mental performance for the purpose of work, study, and performing complex tasks. Since caffeine works as a central nervous stimulant, it will cause the body to “forget” that it is tired. When used in moderation, caffeine can help to keep energy levels up during the day. The caveat is that tolerance is built quickly; to make up for adenosine receptors that have been inhibited by caffeine, the brain will create even more receptors. As a result, more caffeine is needed to keep drowsiness at bay. When the brain detects increased adenosine, it will make you feel even more tired than if you’d never picked up a cup of coffee at all. Now, you’ll need even more caffeine to keep energy levels up and help your brain to function at its best. ### The Feel-Good Effect of Caffeine But what’s so wrong with enjoying a few cups of coffee to perk up your mood and make it through the rest of the day in one piece? Caffeine can immediately improve the mood by stimulating dopamine, although it depletes serotonin over time, which will ultimately cause you to feel worse. Depleting serotonin is no laughing matter. Serotonin is critical to regulating several bodily functions, including sleep cycles, pain control, carbohydrate cravings, and digestion. Low levels of serotonin have also been associated with depressed immune function.![serotonin](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/606px-Serotonin-Spartan-HF-based-on-xtal-3D-balls-web.Bos6JuBt_2jUJHG.webp)_Serotonin_ If you’ve noticed disruptions in your mental state, appetite, and nightly sleep, it may be time to get your caffeine addiction in check. Although there’s no reason to give up coffee altogether, drinking caffeine in moderation can prevent noticeable serotonin depletion. The most obvious sign of a dip in serotonin levels due to caffeine overuse is experiencing a change in mood after having more coffee than normal. ### Resources [Top 10 Coffee Consuming Nations](https://www.worldatlas.com/articles/top-10-coffee-consuming-nations.html) – From World Atlas.
