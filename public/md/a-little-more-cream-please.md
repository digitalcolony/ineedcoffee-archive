# A Little More Cream Please [Cafe Culture](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/cafe-culture/)---by [Florence Rosie Givens](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/florence-rosie-givens/)![A Little More Cream Please](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/a-little-more-cream-please/a-little-more-cream-please1.jpg) ### Make Mine A Double Espresso A single dose of this liquid may not be for me, Especially when the day is what I’m trying to see. To get me through the day with an extra lift, And to get me past the noontime and another shift. This Double Espresso is what the doctor order too, When you have an extra workload looking at you. Times change and people change their flavor, It’s all in the ease of work not in the labor. So “Make Mine A Double Espresso,” to put me back on track, And when I want an extra jolt I just drink mine black. ### Get the Coffee Perking, Before Working A Morning Without Coffee, what we say is give us more! Because we want a cup of coffee before we go out the door. It will take us up to break time and then on beside, For it boost our moral and takes us for an aroma ride. The aroma of coffee is not like any other thing around, As we search for a cup of coffee or two even all over town. We sit in the cafes and coffeehouses not to be without it oh no! For we will have you pass the pot of coffee on our break before we go. To go back to work with a cup of coffee on our desk, Will be what we need when we look at all the mess. Now we have everything under control before the day gets into a hectic flow, We want our morning coffee and will tell you that’s the most we know.
