# Thomas McCaffrey I'm interested in opening a shop right now I just stay home and experiment with ingredients. So far my best is the creamy chocolate coffee. I've had guests tell me they would buy it if it was at Starbucks they liked it so much. So I would start my shop in a town and try to move to a city. - [<h2>Creamy Chocolate Coffee Recipe</h2>December 20, 2012](https://ineedcoffee.com/creamy-chocolate-coffee-recipe/)
