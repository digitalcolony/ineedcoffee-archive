# Ryan L Lewis The artist Ryan L. Lewis, a native of Florida now residing in Wilmington North Carolina has branched out from his usual painting style to create an interesting style of paintings and sculpture using raw coffee as a medium. Most of his works tend to depict coffee cups interacting in "human" situations. Also Ryan continues his work on an upcoming audio CD release, an audio experience based on the making of, the drinking of and the enjoyment of coffee laced with ambient sounds and field recordings. His work is available for commission work and his works are currently for sale. - [<h2>The Coffee Art Corporation</h2>August 1, 2006](https://ineedcoffee.com/the-coffee-art-corporation/)
