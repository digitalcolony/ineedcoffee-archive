# Fred Neve I am an Italian-American and I was practically breast-fed espresso. Currently, I work at a Starbucks in Florida as a barista! So, I have fun and the coffee drinks are on the house. (Damn good deal for me..huh?!!) I love sharing coffee or espresso with friends across the world. I was in the Navy for 12 years and visited 47 countries. I've tried just about every type of coffee imaginable! - [<h2>Pulling the Perfect Shot of Espresso</h2>May 1, 1999](https://ineedcoffee.com/pulling-the-perfect-shot-of-espresso/)
