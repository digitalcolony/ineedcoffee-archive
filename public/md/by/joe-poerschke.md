# Joe Poerschke Joe Poerschke likes to spend his time exploring the country in his pick up truck. He's brewed coffee in over half the states in the union ranging from Albuquerque to the Arctic Circle in Alaska to Maine, in temps from -15 F to 90 F, and at elevations from sea level to 11,500 feet in the Colorado Rockies. Committed to a pot a day, he usually chooses Maxwell House Rich French Roast, though is no snob and is open to drinking whatever may be available, even if it's Starbucks. When not living large he does contract software engineering in Albuquerque. - [<h2>Cowboy Coffee, Backpacker Style</h2>October 14, 2024](https://ineedcoffee.com/cowboy-coffee-backpacker-style/)
