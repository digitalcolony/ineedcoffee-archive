# Myron Joshua Myron Joshua grew up on Chocolate Milk with the gurgling of his mother's Folgers being percolated in the background. At age 18 while living on a Kibbutz in Israel he learned to drink "cafe botz" (Cooked turkish coffee) in the communal dining hall before going to the fields at 5:30 am. From then it was 30 years of instant coffee (no sugar, no milk) until someone poured him a cup of brewed Sumatran. Now he grinds his own beans before going to work at his office in Kibbutz Kfar Etzion. - [<h2>The Story of the Bialetti Moka Express</h2>December 27, 2018](https://ineedcoffee.com/the-story-of-the-bialetti-moka-express/) - [<h2>Yellow Coat: Two Coffee Paintings Tell a Short Story</h2>April 18, 2013](https://ineedcoffee.com/yellow-coat-two-coffee-paintings-tell-a-short-story/) - [<h2>Coffee In Israel</h2>July 18, 2011](https://ineedcoffee.com/coffee-in-israel/) - [<h2>Ceramics and Coffee: The Italian Way!</h2>January 25, 2004](https://ineedcoffee.com/ceramics-and-coffee-the-italian-way/) - [<h2>Saul Bellow: Coffee Achiever</h2>May 1, 2001](https://ineedcoffee.com/saul-bellow-coffee-achiever/) - [<h2>The Zassenhaus Manual Coffee Grinder</h2>January 1, 2001](https://ineedcoffee.com/grind-your-own-coffee-beans/)
