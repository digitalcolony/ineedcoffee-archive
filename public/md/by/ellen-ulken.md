# Ellen Ulken In Louisiana the coffee is often ground with chicory. Jerry and I usually drink a dark roasted chicory brew at home, made by CDM (Cafe du Monde) or Community Coffee, long time New Orleans coffee bean roasters. However, we love a good Cappuccino (dry and low fat) from Starbucks, or from CC's, Community Coffee's own coffee shop chain. P.J.'s is another local java house franchise. Fortunately there's a coffee possibility on every corner these days. It's wonderful. I have come to writing late, as a retiree, and do mostly memoir, but have also penned a small book, meant for young adults, but suitable for all who are interested in the man, on Stephen Collins Foster, composer of "Oh! Susanna" and "Jeanie with the Light Brown Hair." It is now in production at Xlibris and will soon be available to readers. - [<h2>The Coffee Cups â€“ A Short Story</h2>January 1, 2005](https://ineedcoffee.com/the-coffee-cups-a-short-story/)
