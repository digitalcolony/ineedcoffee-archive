Although she used to hate it, she now loves her coffee and is a dab hand at creating innovative recipes, especially with coffee syrups as they are her new addiction. - [<h2>Lola’s Iced Chocolate Espresso</h2>June 21, 2019](https://ineedcoffee.com/lolas-iced-chocolate-espresso/) - [<h2>Iced Mint Mocha Recipe</h2>November 19, 2014](https://ineedcoffee.com/iced-mint-mocha-recipe/) - [<h2>Lola’s Cinnamon Syrup Iced Coffee</h2>July 16, 2013](https://ineedcoffee.com/lolas-cinnamon-syrup-iced-coffee/)
