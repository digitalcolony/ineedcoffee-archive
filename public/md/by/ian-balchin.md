# Ian Balchin I have owned and ran Fables Bookshop in Grahamstown, South Africa, for 20 years now. I do try to ensure that we have reasonable coffee for the staff and not just the lowest grade of instant on the supermarket shelf, sometimes my efforts are even appreciated! I enjoy some computer programming in Perl which frequently causes excessive coffee consumption to concentrate my efforts. I look forward to improving my home brew by roasting my own beans some time. - [<h2>Russell Hobbs High Speed Coffee Grinder</h2>September 9, 2012](https://ineedcoffee.com/russell-hobbs-high-speed-coffee-grinder/) - [<h2>Ian Wins a Russell Hobbs Espresso Machine</h2>November 1, 2010](https://ineedcoffee.com/ian-wins-a-russell-hobbs-espresso-machine/) - [<h2>Coffee Wake-Up!</h2>December 16, 2009](https://ineedcoffee.com/coffee-wake-up/)
