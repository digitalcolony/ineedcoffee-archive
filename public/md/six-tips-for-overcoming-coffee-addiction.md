Beating your Java addiction will not be easy and will probably take you several attempts. I had been drinking coffee since the age of 12 and finally kicked the habit twenty years later. To do this, I implemented a number of simple techniques, which you will learn here. ### #1 Have the right mental attitude If you are in the stages of just contemplating your desire to stop drinking coffee then the task in front of you might seem very daunting indeed. Perhaps you have tried to quit in the past and have failed. What you should keep in mind is that overcoming your addiction is possible as many people do it every day. In your quest to stop drinking coffee mind over matter applies greatly. ### #2 Avoid quitting cold turkey One technique that many people use to quit coffee is to simply stop drinking it all at once. I do not recommend this method. The reason is that you will have increased symptoms of withdrawal such as insomnia, anxiety, and headaches. Furthermore, you also run the risk of consuming too much coffee should you have a binge drinking session. ### #3 Cut back gradually If you drink five cups of coffee per day then you can start by cutting down to four. Once you get used to this level then try to cut down to three then two then one or zero. I like this method of cutting back slowly because it does not cause any shock to your system and you will suffer much less from the uncomfortable withdrawal symptoms. ### #4 Make a cup of weaker coffee There is nothing more delicious and invigorating than a nice cup of strong coffee in the morning. However, if you are looking to nip your coffee-drinking habit in the bud then one thing you can do is to add less coffee when preparing your cup. For example, if you are used to adding three tablespoons per cup then why not try adding two heaping tablespoons and gradually cut back from there. While your coffee will be weaker you can still maintain the taste to a certain degree by using high-quality coffee. ### #5 Stop buying coffee for your home Another great idea is to simply stop purchasing coffee when you go to the supermarket. By not bringing coffee into your home you will be in a much better position to overcome your addiction. One great idea is to stop drinking coffee at home but only drink it occasionally when you are outside with friends. The benefit to this is that you will appreciate your occasional cup of coffee much more than your regular morning cups. ### #6 Find good substitutes The morning cup of coffee is a cherished ritual for many people. There is nothing more comforting than sipping a hot beverage upon waking up. One thing that you can do is to find a good substitute. Many people use either fruit juice or tea as an alternative. One technique I knew to use daily is to prepare a cup of strong black tea with two Lipton tea bags. After I finish steeping the tea, I add two teaspoons of sugar and a generous amount of milk. The sugar and milk help ease the teaâ€™s acidity and make it very delicious. Furthermore, I am still able to get my much-needed caffeine fix.![strong tea](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/strong-tea1.BA8zJDSj_1u9bc9.webp)_A strong tea made using 2 bags of Lipton_ I hope that you have found these suggestions for quitting drinking coffee helpful.
