# Making Lampshades and Flowers With Used Coffee Filters [Cafe Culture](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/cafe-culture/)---by [Michael Allen Smith](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/michael-allen-smith/)![Making Lampshades and Flowers With Used Coffee Filters](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/making-lampshades-and-flowers-with-used-coffee-filters/coffee-filter-lampshade.jpg) At INeedCoffee, we always want to see what artistic things can be created using coffee. We have [three](https://ineedcoffee.com/coffee-art/) [different](https://ineedcoffee.com/art-of-farr-coffee-greeting-cards/) [galleries](https://ineedcoffee.com/the-coffee-art-corporation/) by different artists that have used coffee grounds to create amazing artwork. Vilma Silveira Farrell takes a different path. Instead of using coffee grounds, she uses coffee filters to make her artwork. In a series of emails, I learned that Vilma collects used coffee filters from coffee shops. The filters are cleaned and dried, then dyed to the desired color. If you want a dark brown color, the coffee grounds are left inside the filter during the drying process. Once dry, the grounds are removed. ### Coffee Filter Lampshades The coffee filter lampshades are made with a wire mesh for sturdiness. A fire retardant is used on the filters, and the lampshades are open at the top and bottom for air circulation. > Handcrafting a coffee filter lampshade is timing consuming. It takes hours and hours and sometimes days of work but is amazingly rewarding – especially when a lamp is finished, the light switch hit, and I can see how beautifully the light filters through the shade.![lampshade-3](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/lampshade-3.Bm-PNx6q_1SIOtx.webp)![lampshade-5](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/lampshade-5.CHLUYZk8_29etwM.webp)![lampshade-4](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/lampshade-4.gW5-F4Q3_Z1wO3A3.webp) ### Coffee Filter Wall Flowers In addition to lampshades, Vilma has used coffee filters to create flowers on canvas.![flowers-5](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/flowers-5-616x650.CgnxGKb-_ZT2upn.webp)![flowers-4](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/flowers-4.CCAjeX04_1J5Lio.webp)![flowers-3](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/flowers-3.Cd71V_lp_1d6BNH.webp)![flowers-2](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/flowers-2.DUP16C1h_R8vYq.webp)![flowers-1](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/flowers-1.BPAWeiE6_Zgmg5X.webp) ### About the Artist Vilma Silveira Farrell is the artisan behind Lampada. She is from Brazil, the land of dark coffee and rich spices. She was a journalist for many years, but now she lives in NYC as a stay-at-home mom. Rather than putting pen to paper to write a story, she puts on her artisan’s hat and dives into the stains of the coffee. You can learn more about Vilma’s art on the [Lampada Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Lampada/193191290786365) and the Lampada Etsy page.
