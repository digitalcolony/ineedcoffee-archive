# Coffee Mugs of Coffee Fanatics Part 2 [Cafe Culture](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/cafe-culture/)---by [Michael Allen Smith](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/michael-allen-smith/)![Coffee Mugs of Coffee Fanatics Part 2](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/coffee-mugs-of-coffee-fanatics-part-2/ryan-mug.jpg) As soon as we released [Coffee Mugs of Coffee Fanatics](https://ineedcoffee.com/coffee-mugs-of-coffee-fanatics/), Both INeedCoffee and Paul over at the Caffination podcast received more mug submissions. I didn’t expect to have a Part 2 so soon. Without further introduction, below are **more** Coffee Mugs of Coffee Fanatics.**Alex Scofield, Cape Cod**> _During a transitional stage in life, this is my go-to mug. My wife and I moved from the Washington, D.C. area to Cape Cod several months ago. Ordinarily, I drink my coffee from a 20-oz. mug with the old-school New England Patriots logo on it. But that mug, like so many of our belongings, remains in storage as we look for a more permanent place to live. In the meantime, this mug does the trick — it may not be a design I’d pick out for myself, but it’s pretty appropriate for the Cape. More importantly, it also holds 20 ounces of coffee._![alex scofield mug](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/alex-mug1.Bt6M7PHi_1iHX3t.webp)_Alex’s Mug_**Ryan Jacobs, Columbus**> _My travel mug fits perfectly in my car, allows for great flavor since it is ceramic and gets cleaned without leaving a soapy residue. The only complaint is that the handle is a bit awkward._![ryan mug](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/ryan-mug.Dw23g-Ln_Zuj29j.webp)_Ryan’s Mug_**Mike Rohde, [rohdesign.com](https://rohdesign.com/)**> _This favorite mug was given to me on Father’s Day 2007, featuring a photo of my son Nathan and I in matching yellow shirts. This is a favorite for enjoying a cappuccino, alternating with my Penguin mug._![](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/mike-mug.C-9l52E1_ZSjiYc.webp) Mike has more favorite mugs, which can be viewed on his [Flickr Coffee Stuff Set](http://www.flickr.com/photos/rohdesign/sets/72157604328114682/).**Geoff Manning** Geoff had the Daddy Rockstar mug made at the Cafe Press store for his Daddy Rockstar blog.![Daddy Rockstar](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/daddy-rockstar500.DfR5dnaA_Z1l1JuN.webp)_Daddy Rockstar Mug_**Michael Long, _Michael’s Technology News_**> _The story behind this mug is that it’s my favorite mug. I like it because it also comes with a heated warmer (not shown) that plugs into the cigarette lighter of your car/truck._![thermal](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/thermal.CFPgZ7AR_oLi1a.webp)_Michael Long’s Mug_ Published on April 1, 2008--- #### Michael Allen Smith Michael Allen Smith is both a coffee fanatic and a web developer.
