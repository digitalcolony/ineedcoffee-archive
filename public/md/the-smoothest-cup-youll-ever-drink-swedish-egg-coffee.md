# The Smoothest Cup You’ll Ever Drink – Swedish Egg Coffee [Brewing Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/brewing-coffee/)---by [Alex Freemon](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/alex-freemon/)![The Smoothest Cup You’ll Ever Drink – Swedish Egg Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/the-smoothest-cup-youll-ever-drink-swedish-egg-coffee/Swedish-Egg-Coffee.jpg) Between panoramic fjords, the world’s greatest saunas, and wild, cold-water salmon, the Nordic region of Europe should be a place you visit at some point in your life. Barring an actual trip, you can still taste the locale by making and drinking the Swede’s unique take on java: egg coffee. Egg coffee is also known as Scandinavian coffee or Hungarian coffee. Recently listed in the article [11 Crazy Coffee Drinks You Won’t Find on a Starbucks Menu](https://ineedcoffee.com/11-crazy-coffee-drinks-you-wont-find-on-a-starbucks-menu/) here on INeedCoffee, Swedish egg coffee is dead simple to make. The result is a non-bitter, surprisingly light, and incredibly smooth cup that combines the wonderful flavor of your favorite roast with a reminiscent aftertaste of toasted cheese (trust me, it sounds strange, but it works). Ok, so to make this strange and delightful concoction, you are going to need the following: - 1 fresh egg - 1 to 1 ½ tbs of your preferred coffee, [coarsely ground](https://ineedcoffee.com/coffee-grind-chart/) (similar to what you would use for a French press) - 1 cup of water - 1 cup of ice-cold water (yes, that’s a total of 2 cups of water) - Sugar and milk to taste - Saucepan All of this together will make a single serving of coffee; multiply accordingly for the number of cups you want.![swedish egg coffee ingredients](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/image06-650x433.DPZAvWhy_ZShTPO.webp)_Necessary ingredients_### #1 Boil the Water Start boiling the first cup of water in a small pot.![coffee boil water](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/image05-650x433.D4BpHjT8_1RHkE8.webp)_Boiling Water_### #2 Crack the Egg and Stir While the water is boiling, crack the egg (with the shell) into a cup and stir.![swedish egg coffee - crack egg](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/image04-433x650.DclPO87r_2o3lFi.webp)_Cracked egg_### #3 Add the Ground Coffee Add the ground coffee to the egg and stir some more.![add ground coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/image03-433x650.Bnyjrt9-_1BEl27.webp)_Coffee and egg, pre-mixing_### #4 Add Egg-Coffee Slurry to Boiling Water Once you have the egg-coffee slurry thoroughly mixed, add it to the boiling water.![coffee egg slurry](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/image00-650x433.2wLo_iXx_Z1SyJtX.webp)_Coffee-egg slurry_### #5 Boil for 5 Minutes Let the mixture boil for 5 minutes, being careful not to overflow (because it will want to overflow).![coffee boiling 5 minutes](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/image01-433x650.B1a9GDCi_mcUWP.webp)_Boiling mixture_### #6 End Boil and Add Cold Water After boiling, remove the mixture from the heat and add the cup of ice-cold water. The egg and coffee clumps should sink to the bottom of the pot, allowing you to easily pour off the coffee and leave behind most of the undesired bits.![undesired bits - egg coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/image02-650x433.CC6bmRmS_M9GeG.webp)_Undesired bits_### #7 Filter and Serve Pour the liquid through a fine-mesh strainer or use a French press (like I did) to extract the coffee goodness.![Swedish egg coffee finished](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/image07-433x650.nzo9GTXI_1MhPfr.webp)_Coffee goodness_ There you have it—yet another new and fancy way to brew the world’s greatest drink. Sit back, enjoy, and, really, take a trip to Sweden some time. It’s worth it. ### Resources [Coffee Brewing Guide](https://ineedcoffee.com/coffee-brewing-guide/) – Our collection of coffee brewing tutorials.
