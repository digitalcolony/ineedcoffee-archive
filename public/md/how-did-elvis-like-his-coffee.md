In 2008, Elvis researcher Adam Victor came out with The Elvis Encyclopedia. It could very well be the definitive Elvis research book. So, how did Elvis take his coffee? According to the book (p 172 Food): > At breakfast time he drank orange juice and coffee (served with half & half and as a concession to his diet, Sweet ‘n’ Low). Speaking of sweeteners, here is another interesting tidbit from the Food section: > In _Double Trouble_, Elvis’ character claims to take 418 lumps of sugar in his tea!![Elvis Coffee Mug](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/elvis-mug-temp-change.BytbAT8S_SNN4r.webp) *Timeless Elvis Presley Heat Changing Coffee Mug – Add Hot Liquid and Watch Elvis go from Vegas to Memphis * The section on Drugs (p121) tells us that by the mid-1970s, Elvis was stacking his coffee with other things. > According to Dr. Nichopoulus, Elvis’ daily regiment was coffee, vitamins and an appetite suppressant (sometimes amphetamine-based) to start the day; he’d also take a decongestant and blood pressure medicine soon after waking up. If you are an Elvis fan, _The Elvis Encyclopedia_ by Adam Victor is a must-own book for your library.![elvis encyclopedia book](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/elvis-encyclopedia-book1.Dn7DfJEK_ZAUCM7.webp)_The Elvis Encyclopedia_### Resources [Frank Zappa: Coffee Achiever](https://ineedcoffee.com/frank-zappa-coffee-achiever/) – Another musician who loved coffee.
