Let’s explore the different possibilities. #### Coffee Roast Level When making chocolate-covered coffee beans, aim for a medium to medium-dark roast. Lighter roasts can taste acidic, whereas darker roasts can taste bitter. Aim for the middle.![Chart showing different coffee roast levels by color](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/Roasting_Card_image.DSUG2bPg_ZcRjkb.webp)_Use beans in the 2 to 5 range for best results—chart courtesy of INeedCoffee contributor Len Brault._  #### Coffee Varietals**Coffee Arabica:** Arabica is native to Ethiopia and it produces small and flattened beans. Despite their size, they’re very aromatic and fragrant. This is the most common varietal in specialty coffee and is likely what you will use for this recipe.**Coffee Robusta:** Robusta is native to Congo and its beans are round-shaped and very rich in caffeine. For this reason, they are also very bitter, so they are not a good choice for this recipe. It is preferable to taste this variety of coffee as a drink when blended with Arabica.**Coffee Liberica:** Liberica is native to Liberia and it has big and well-shaped beans. It is not a prized variety, but it is well-suited for this preparation.**Coffee Excelsa:** Excelsa is a recent variety (it was only discovered in 1904) native to Northern Africa. Its beans have a medium size and their aroma is very similar to the Arabica ones so they are the perfect choice for this recipe. ### Conclusion There are many recipes online for making chocolate-covered coffee or espresso beans that are more basic. This recipe combines the strengths of three different forms of chocolate along with the heat from chili powder and the sweetness of coconut to make something special.
