# Caffeine Consumption By Coffee Fanatics [Coffee and Health](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/coffee-health/)---by [Michael Allen Smith](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/michael-allen-smith/)![Caffeine Consumption By Coffee Fanatics](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/caffeine-consumption-by-coffee-fanatics/coke-zero-thailand1.jpg) Once people learn about the INeedCoffee website, they come to the same conclusion. _You must drink a lot of coffee!_ I tried to defend myself for the longest time by explaining that I prefer quality over quantity. I don’t think I drink a lot of coffee. But what is considered _a lot of coffee_? I have an uncle who consumes more coffee in a day than I do in a week. But I also know people who could make the same comparison about me. In this article, I’ve decided to lay my cards on the table and let you decide if I consume too little or too much caffeine. To make it more interesting, I’ve invited other INeedCoffee contributors to send me a _typical day_ journal of caffeine consumption.**Michael Allen Smith, Seattle** My weapon of choice is espresso, although recently I have developed a taste for many oolong and green teas. - **5:45 AM** – Oolong Tea - **6:15 AM** – Double Espresso - **7:45 AM** – Double Espresso - **10:00 AM** – Coke Zero (1 can) - **12:15 PM** – Double Espresso - **2:45 PM** – Double Espresso (gym days only) - **5:45 PM** – Green Tea![coke zero thailand](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/coke-zero-thailand1.CUHQyQ-E_2qHvUU.webp)_Coke Zero in Thailand_**Paul Rj Muller, CaffiNation USA** Paul runs the [CaffiNation](https://www.caffination.com/) website.
