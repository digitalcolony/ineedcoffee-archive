# Coffee and Barbecue [Recipes](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/coffee-recipes/)---by [Chris Arnold](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/chris-arnold/)![Coffee and Barbecue](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/coffee-and-barbecue/Coffee-and-Barbecue.jpg) Coffee and Barbecue? Yep, Coffee and B-B-Q go hand-in-hand like, well, a couple of hands. Anyhow, we are going to show you a dry rub that works well on pork, as well as a sauce to go with that tasty hog flesh. The idea for integrating coffee and barbecue came when I was slow-cooking some pork ribs on a hot and humid summer day. I had been drinking iced tea, but what I really wanted was coffee. So, I started to experiment with iced coffee. Anyhow, one thing led to another, and I realized that along with my iced coffee, the pork would taste better if it, too, had some coffee overtones. The rub was a no-brainer, but the sauce didn’t come to me until later. The marriage of the two is really tasty, especially when enjoyed with a cold coffee drink. Although this recipe is designed for pork ribs and such, you may be able to come up with your own recipe for other types of BBQ, such as beef ribs, beer can chicken, or even a rack of lamb. Don’t be afraid to experiment! ### Squealin’ Good Wake-Me-Up Java Rub![Squealin&amp;#x27; Good Wake-Me-Up Java Rub](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/java-rub.bbeB_jMu_wdyuo.webp)_Squealin’ Good Wake-Me-Up Java Rub_- 1/3 cup of your Favorite Roasted Coffee Medium Grind (I like Ethiopian Yergacheffe, Ethiopian Lekempti, or Guatemala Antigua) - 2 Tbsp Brown Sugar - 2 Tbsp Kosher Salt - 1 Tbsp Fresh Ground Black Pepper - 1 Tbsp Chili Powder - 1 Tbsp Cumin - 1 Tbsp Garlic Powder Mix all ingredients well and apply generously to most cuts of pork. Pat into the meat well before grilling or smoking. We like to use it on baby backs or pork spareribs. This rub also works for pork loin and pork chops on the grill. Remember, the recipe above is a guideline. Don’t be afraid to experiment with other ingredients like rosemary, ginger, cinnamon, or nutmeg. ### Brown Eye Piggy Sauce![Brown Eye Piggy Sauce](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/piggy-sauce.O0dSaU8d_Z2sdQU0.webp)_Brown Eye Piggy Sauce_- 1 bottle of your favorite BBQ sauce (I like Sweet Baby Rays Hickory and Brown Sugar) - 4 ounces of your favorite triple-strength brewed coffee or some espresso (I like Papua New Guinea, Sumatra, or Java Estate). - 2 Tbsp Tabasco Sauce (I like Regular or Chipotle Tobasco) - 1 Tbsp Fresh Ground Black Pepper - 1 Tbsp of your Favorite Bourbon Whiskey (I like Makers Mark or Jack Daniels) If brewing your coffee, add three times the amount of coffee grounds as normal and only brew through about 4-6 ounces. If using espresso, pull two to three doubles. Mix all ingredients well. The BBQ sauce will thin. If it thins too much, have another bottle of sauce ready and add enough to attain the desired consistency. Apply to the final 15 minutes of your BBQ. Remember, the recipe above is a guideline. Don’t be afraid to experiment with other ingredients like apple juice, cilantro, fresh garlic, or molasses.
