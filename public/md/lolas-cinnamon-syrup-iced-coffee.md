# Lola’s Cinnamon Syrup Iced Coffee [Recipes](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/coffee-recipes/)---by [Lola Low](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/lola-low/)![Lola’s Cinnamon Syrup Iced Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/lolas-cinnamon-syrup-iced-coffee/Cinnamon-Syrup-Iced-Coffee.jpg) You know the feeling of waking up each morning from a sleepy haze, stumbling out of bed blurry eyed wishing it was a Saturday. You have to be at your desk in an hour. You know the drinks machine will sit humming in the background, trying to lull you into craving a cup of plastic-tasting brown water that has been flashed past a couple of grains of instant before landing in a polystyrene cup. Only a couple of weeks ago I would have told you I unquestionably hate coffee. The bitter taste. The overly-rich aroma. And not to mention the death breath after taste. Having been used to instant coffee, I now understand my former hate for it.![Cinnamon Syrup Iced Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/cinammon-coffee-drink1.COAcFjiY_2gI4D9.webp)_Cinnamon Syrup Iced Coffee_ Working for a wholesale coffee supplier has converted me into a coffee enthusiast. I’ve only been at Cafe Rico a couple of weeks, and although still not keen on straight coffee, syrups are my latest addiction. Although there are loads of flavours; white chocolate, vanilla, mint, almond, banana, and amaretto; cinnamon is my favourite. Reddish-brown in colour, and made from natural fruits, nuts, spices, water, and syrup, Monin syrups have transformed my view of coffee. My love for these syrups has got me making all kinds of concoctions. With summer looming, I thought it a good idea to try creating some kind of iced coffee creation. So I set about digging ice from the depths of my Arctic freezer, dusted off my blender, and stuck the kettle on. To try this iced creation, you’ll need: - Colombian coffee (make it as strong or weak as you like) - Monin cinnamon coffee syrup (Not too much as it can be overpowering – about a teaspoon) - Whipped Cream - Cinnamon sprinkles - Lots of ice - Milk (the amount depends on how strong you like it)![Monin cinnamon coffee syrup](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/monin-syrup-coffee-drink.BNDtGWTK_ZGdI3x.webp)_Monin cinnamon coffee syrup_### Directions 1. Mix the hot coffee with the desired amount of cinnamon syrup. 2. Blend the ice and milk together and stir in with the coffee and syrup. 3. Top with whipped cream and cinnamon sprinkles. Having devised this iced coffee infusion with coffee syrup means I now enjoy sweet-tasting coffee. No longer are there huge granules of white sugar sitting at the bottom of my cup like sand at the bottom of a tide pool until gulped down in one grainy, sugary mouthful. Cinnamon is the best; a slightly spicy, strong, piquant flavour certainly brightens up my day. And my cup of coffee. ### Resources [The Coffee Avocado Shake Recipe](https://ineedcoffee.com/the-coffee-avocado-shake/) – A delicious coffee-based drink recipe from the Philippines.
