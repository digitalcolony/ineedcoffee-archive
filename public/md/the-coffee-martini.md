# The Coffee Martini (3 Recipes) [Recipes](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/coffee-recipes/)---by [Chris Arnold](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/chris-arnold/)![The Coffee Martini (3 Recipes)](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/the-coffee-martini/coffee-martini-recipes.jpg) Martinis used to be a stiff drink. After all, it’s mostly hard liquor. Then James Bond came along and made the martini hip, and sometime in the ’80s or ’90s, they started adding “tini” to the end of everything, and the modern foo-foo martini was born. If done right, the “Coffeetini” or “Espresso Martini” can appeal to both guys and girls while still remaining respectable. Let’s get a few details out of the way before we look at the recipes. First things first. Vodka or Gin? Definitely Vodka. I love Gin, but I don’t think it works with coffee. What kind of Vodka? Use a true, premium Vodka like _619 Vodka_. I avoid infused vodkas for this particular drink since I want real coffee as the main star. But do what you feel is best. I like to keep my Vodka in the freezer for this kind of recipe. Don’t worry, it won’t freeze.![coffee martini 619 vodka](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/coffee-martini-619-vodka1.CB6uYiSq_Z2m6ctL.webp)_Coffee Martini with 619 Vodka_ What about the glasses? Well, Martini glasses of course. But for a colder drink, freeze them ahead of time, along with the Vodka. Shaken or stirred? I like stirred, mainly because it involves less work and I don’t have a shaker. Either will work. Brewed, espresso, or instant coffee? Actually, they all can work, but I find the espresso or instant works the best. In the case of espresso or brewed coffee, keep in mind you want to use it fresh, which means it will be hot, which also means it will dilute somewhat when mixed with the ice. This naturally means the espresso will hold up better since it is concentrated. You could chill the espresso or coffee first, but the freshness is somewhat diminished. Try it if you like, and compare the differences. In terms of bean origin, I have tried everything from Brazilian beans to Ethiopian beans to Sumatran beans. They all work well, but the Sumatran is my favorite. Just use what you have and compare.![Coffee Martini](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/coffee-martini.BAudgNui_Z25wgKq.webp)_Coffee Martini_ Instant coffee is a great choice if you are in a hurry or want to save some time. Don’t laugh, coffee geeks. Instant coffee can taste pretty good in cold drinks and dissolves even in cold water. A great choice if you don’t have an espresso machine or don’t have the time. It also allows you to easily increase the coffee flavor concentration on the fly. You might even be able to use cold-brewed coffee, but I haven’t tried it. I suspect it might be too mellow. One last note on liqueurs. A lot of coffee martini recipes include Kahlua, which is a coffee liqueur. I don’t care for it, generally speaking, in the first place, and for Coffee Martinis, I prefer to let the real coffee provide that flavor element. However, I have included Creme de cacao, which is a chocolate-flavored liqueur with hints of vanilla. You could potentially use real chocolate sauce or syrup, but I haven’t tried it. I am also afraid it might sweeten the drink too much.![Coffee Martini with Creme de cacao](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/coffee-cream-martini.DIrID_Cc_J1k8U.webp)_Coffee Martini with Creme de Cacao_ Please experiment. ### Recipes**Classic Coffee Martini**- Double Shot of Espresso or 1-2 Tbsp. of Instant Coffee mixed with 2 ounces of water - 2 Ounces of Premium Vodka Pour the espresso or coffee mixture over the ice in a pitcher or shaker filled with ice, followed by the Vodka. Stir or shake the coffee and vodka for at least 1 minute. Strain and pour into a Martini glass. OPTIONAL: Garnish with lemon or orange peel. If you want to sweeten the drink a bit, you can also add some sugar syrup to the liquid mixture.**Vanilla Cream Martini**- Double Shot of Espresso or 1-2 Tbsp. of Instant Coffee mixed with 2 ounces of water - 2 Ounces of Premium Vodka - 1/2 Cup Heavy Cream - 1/2 Tsp Vanilla extract - 2 Tsp Raw Brown Sugar In a cold metal bowl, use an electric mixer on low to turn the heavy cream into whipped cream. Mix in the sugar and vanilla mid-way through and continue until the mixture has stiff peaks. In a pitcher or shaker filled with ice, pour the espresso or coffee mixture over the ice, followed by the Vodka. Stir or shake the coffee and vodka for at least 1 minute. Strain and pour into a Martini glass. Dollop the whipped cream mixture on top. OPTIONAL: Rub the rim of the glass with Vodka and coat it with sugar. You can also drop 2 or 3 coffee beans on top of the cream. If you want to sweeten the drink a bit, you can add some sugar syrup to the liquid mixture.**Creamy Dark Chocolate Martini**- Double Shot of Espresso or 1-2 Tbsp. of Instant Coffee mixed with 2 ounces of water - 1 1/2 Ounces of Premium Vodka - 1 Ounce Creme de Cacao Dark - 1/4 cup Half & Half In a pitcher or shaker filled with ice, pour the espresso or coffee mixture over the ice, followed by the Vodka, Creme de Cacao, and Half & Half. Stir or shake the coffee and vodka for at least 1 minute. Strain and pour into a Martini glass. OPTIONAL: Include some large pieces of dark chocolate on the rim. This can be tricky but is made easier by using a hot knife to put a groove in the chocolate, to allow it to sit on the rim. You can also add a whipping cream dollop (from another recipe), and float some small chocolate shavings on top. You can also add some sugar syrup to the liquid mixture if you want to sweeten the drink a bit.![619 Vodka](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/619vodka.DunaBIEQ_JDmDE.webp)_619 Vodka by 619 Spirits_### Conclusion Don’t be afraid to use the above recipes to experiment or even combine some elements of them.
