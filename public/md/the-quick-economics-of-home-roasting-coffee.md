# The Quick Economics of Home Roasting Coffee [Roasting Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/roasting-coffee/)---by [Michael Allen Smith](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/michael-allen-smith/) What does the coffee fanatic do during a recession? On the surface, there appear to be four choices. 1. Do nothing differently. Cut spending elsewhere. _Let the dog eat generic chow while you are sipping on your Cup of Excellence coffee._2. Cut back on the QUANTITY of coffee. _Have one less coffee a day._3. Cut back on the QUALITY of coffee. _Goodbye local roaster, hello canned coffee._4. Start roasting your own coffee. _Brilliant idea!_ Option 1 is the first line of defense. But what if you’ve already cut back your expenses in other areas? Option 2 is the most efficient method but requires the most discipline. Option 3 is just wrong. Never sacrifice quality. That leaves us with Option 4. Let me review the numbers and show you how much money you could save by home-roasting your coffee. Before I go through the numbers, I must say that home-roasting coffee is super easy, and many businesses sell green coffee beans. For help on getting started with home roasting, look over the [Roasting Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/roasting-coffee/) section. It has many tutorials and articles to get you started.![Green Coffee Beans](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/green-coffee-beans-economics1.7Is0k-6V_Z20UIVJ.webp)_Green Coffee Beans_ Now for the economics. On the Internet, many different varietals of unroasted green coffee can be purchased for $5-$7 a pound. Note that this is not a wholesale price but a way individuals can buy sizes of one to five pounds. For this example, I will use $6 as my one-pound price. Island and award-winning coffees will cost more. Some beans will be less. Buying larger sizes at one time will also reduce your costs and sometimes your shipping expenses. When a pound of coffee is roasted, it will lose 15-20% of its weight. This means a pound of unroasted coffee does not equal a pound of roasted coffee. For this example, I will use 17.5% weight loss. The next expense to consider is the cost and expected life of the roaster. Home coffee roasters are not immortal. Home coffee roasters range in price from a $2 oven tray to over $1,000. I’ve roasted coffee using many different methods, and even though roasters are built much better today, I still allow for a 50-cent per pound depreciation on the roaster. Some roasters are tanks and will last much longer. Some are duds and will have a shorter life. Other home roasters have disagreed with my 50-cent number as being too much. I’d rather err on the conservative side. The takeaway point is that a home coffee roaster has a finite lifespan. Green Coffee Price per lb $6.00 Weight Loss 17.5% Roasted Price per lb $7.19 Roaster Depreciation per lb $0.50 True Coffee Price per lb $7.69_* I did not calculate electricity because the fuel cost of getting to and from a coffeehouse for most people will be more significant._ In the home roasting example above, coffee costs 48 cents per ounce. Here in Seattle, I would estimate the price of roasted coffee is double that. **If a family consumed 1 lb of coffee per week, home-roasting their own coffee would save about $400 a year.**![Lyman Kona Extra Fancy Green Coffee Beans](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/kona-green-coffee-beans.-hoxVJ2b_24oOP8.webp)_Lyman Kona Extra Fancy Green Coffee Beans_ Some places sell green beans for less than $6 a pound if money is tight. You can find beans in the $4-$5 price range. There are also green bean cooperatives that pool the resources of many home roasters so they can buy beans at even lower wholesale prices. From the interview [Meeting Up With The Green Coffee Buying Club](https://ineedcoffee.com/meeting-up-with-the-green-coffee-buying-club/): > _So a typical nice Ethiopian Harrar for example might come in at $2.50/lb. So on 15 lbs, the coffee is $37.50, shipping is about $10, and the “PayPal, insurance, & packaging fees” are about another $10. So $37.50 + $10 + $10 = $57.50/15 lbs = $3.83/lb, or about $4/lb in round numbers._ Should you roast your coffee? That depends on what your time is worth, how much coffee you drink, how tight your budget is, and if it sounds like a fun hobby. Also, roasting coffee for friends makes an excellent and memorable gift. Unlike that $15 bottle of wine, they will be eager to consume your home-roasted coffee the next day.
