# 10 Reasons I Love Cold Brew Coffee [Brewing Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/brewing-coffee/)---by [Michael Allen Smith](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/michael-allen-smith/)![10 Reasons I Love Cold Brew Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/10-reasons-i-love-cold-brew-coffee/cold-brew-coffee-love.jpg) The first time I had cold-brew coffee, I didn’t like it at all. I used a Toddy with coffee that was ground too fine, and I didn’t know I was making a concentrate, so the coffee was much too strong. It would be years before I would try cold-brew coffee again. I’m so glad I did because I’ve become quite a fan. I now drink cold-brew coffee every day. The other day, I jotted down ten reasons I love cold brew coffee. Maybe an idea or two from this list will inspire you to make your own cold brew coffee. ### #1 Simple to Make Add cold water over ground coffee and let it sit for a day. Filter, and you are done. That is as simple as it gets. Anyone is capable of making great cold-brew coffee. INeedCoffee has some detailed tutorials customized to different brewers, but the steps are mostly the same.

With cold brew, you can fix your coffee. If you discover the coffee is too weak at the end of the brew cycle, you can extend the brew time. With some brewers such as the [Penguin](https://ineedcoffee.com/make-concentrated-cold-brew-coffee-with-the-penguin-coffee/), this will be as easy as removing the filter and returning it to the brewing chamber. If the coffee is too strong, that is fine, as you are usually making a concentrate. Just add water until you reach the coffee strength you prefer. Usually, it only takes one or two brew cycles to find your optimal level of grounds, water, and brewing time. For example, I’m currently filling my Penguin filter about 70% full of medium-coarse coffee. Then, I fill the brewer 100% full of water and brew for 24-30 hours. When complete, I cut the concentrate 50% with water. My roommate, who likes stronger coffee, cuts it 25% with water.![penguin cold brew](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/brewing-cold-brew.DwOPNgnH_Z12mVgk.webp) ### #3 Save Time, Perfect For Non-Morning People Having a quart of coffee concentrate in the refrigerator already made means I don’t need to spend time making coffee. I used to make an AeroPress first thing in the morning. I’d set the kettle, weigh the beans, grind the coffee, pour, stir, wait, and then press. Now, I just grab the pre-made cold brew. I’m a morning person, but I can see cold brew being a godsend for people who don’t have the energy to make coffee first thing in the morning. ### #4 Power Outages are Not a Problem This winter, we had a few power outages, one lasting 10 hours. During this time, I could not grind coffee or heat water, but it wasn’t a problem for me because I had a quart of cold brew already made. Not needing power also makes cold brew coffee a good candidate for camping and long road trips. ### #5 Old Coffee Works Great I learned this trick from a few coffee shops here in Seattle. They use old coffee that wasn’t sold for their cold brew. Cold brew is super forgiving. Coffee that is too old and stale for most brewing methods can be saved with cold brew. I’ve used medium to lightly roasted coffee, two months old, for a delicious cold brew. Using old coffee that I normally would have thrown out is great because it saves me money—less waste. ### #6 Cold Brew is Quiet If you live with others and wake up before them, pouring a glass of cold brew is far quieter than firing up a grinder and a kettle. Let everyone else sleep a little longer. If you are the first to rise, be ninja quiet with your coffee. ### #7 When you need “just a sip” Sometimes in the late afternoon, I want some coffee, but I also know it could interfere with sleep. With cold brew, I can grab “just a sip”. Other brewing methods are not ideal for anything less than a mug. This also makes cold brew ideal when you are detoxing from coffee. As you reduce your coffee intake below a mug, a sip or two of cold brew is a good idea to ward off any caffeine headaches. ### #8 Tastes Good Hot or Cold You do not need to drink cold brew cold. It tastes good when heated up. I heat my morning mug in the microwave. First, I do 55 seconds, followed by a stir, then 36 more seconds. This brings it to the perfect heat level without heating the coffee too much. Every microwave is different, so your times may vary. ### #9 Easy on the Stomach I had no issues drinking black coffee on an empty stomach for many years. Then early last year, I gradually started noticing minor pain and growling. I experimented with a few ideas, including Coffee Tamer mineral packs, decaf, and using half & half. In the end, cold brew worked best for me. Cold-brew coffee is known for having low acidity. For months now, I have been drinking cold-brew coffee on an empty stomach with no issues. ### #10 New Cold Brewers Make Brewing Much Easier Cold brewers historically had two problems. First, you needed to weigh and measure the water and the coffee, get out a calculator, and figure out a ratio. Second, cleanup wasn’t easy. These problems have been eliminated with some of the newer glass brewers that use fine-mesh metal filters. New brewers such as the Penguin and the Alkani have been designed to make cold brew easier to make and much easier to clean up.![Alkani Cold Coffee Brewer setup](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/cold-brew-coffee-setup.BWTiOpQS_qdYR4.webp) The [Alkani](https://ineedcoffee.com/alkani-cold-brew-coffee-maker-review-tutorial/) is one of the new cold brewer models that uses a metal filter, which makes cleaning a simple task. Remove the filter, empty the grounds into a compost bin, rinse, and it is ready for the next brew. ### Other Reasons There are other reasons to love cold brew that I haven’t even explored. One growing area is the use of cold brew in coffee-based cocktails. It is also great to have on a camping or backpacking trip. ### Getting Started Although you could start making [cold brew coffee in your French Press](https://ineedcoffee.com/making-cold-brew-coffee-french-press/), I love the newer dedicated cold-brewers much more. Look into the Penguin or the Alkani. New cold brewers are hitting the market all the time now. Look for a sturdy glass frame, a metal filter, and a size that best suits your needs. ### Resources [21 Reasons I Love Cold Brew Coffee](https://criticalmas.org/2021/04/21-reasons-i-love-cold-brew-coffee/) – An updated list by the author.
