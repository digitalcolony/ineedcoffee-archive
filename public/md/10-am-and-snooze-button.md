And how long Have you stood there, Pouring coffee For me?![pour coffee cup](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/pour-coffee-cup1.CDj6dSD8_Z10RAKK.webp)_Pour Coffee_### Snooze Button Each morning, your eyes open slowly like small suns on the horizon of my day. Coffee brews on auto; waking the cat who comes to meow her indignation. You reach for me with nested warmth from beneath the covers to pull me back to you, And I am happy as the world goes away, if only for a few minutes more. Copyright 2004 Ava C.
