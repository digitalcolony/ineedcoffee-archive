Lay centered on a flat surface. Drip coffee over the paper, allowing it to splash/splatter. Do not rinse, drain or otherwise remove puddles of coffee. This ensures that your splash patterns will dry distinctly. When dry, if you want more splashes, repeat the process, dripping more coffee onto paper and allowing it to dry.![coffee on white paper](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/cpapera1.Ch-6tjU2_1pv0mi.webp)_Step 1 for the Coffee Wrapping Paper_ Once satisfied with the pattern, spread the paint in a pan or dip the brush in paint.

Stamp in spaces between your coffee splotches. Load stamp with paint and start in the center of your paper with the first stamping. 2. Stamp a second or third time moving outward to the sides of the paper, making a lighter impression as you move outward. 3. Stamping a balanced but semi-random pattern is easier. Finish your project with a third process, such as paint splatters flicked on from a brush, rolled on with a decorative brayer, or highlight the areas of your pattern with a gel metallic pen. ### Coffee Decorated White Paper Sack![Coffee Decorated White Paper Sack](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/cpapere.Cj99Nsqf_1P3BRF.webp)_Coffee Decorated White Paper Sack_ To do this: dip a mug into coffee and press it onto the sack, making coffee rings.
