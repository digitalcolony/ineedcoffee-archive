The Ottomans invented Kahve, Turkish coffee hundreds of years ago. The exceptional taste, body, aroma, preparation, and presentation associated with Turkish coffee lend it an exclusive identity that is infused with time-honored tradition. Made with high-quality Arabica beans from Central America and Brazil, the coffee is first blended, then roasted to a medium-light level, and finally ground into an extra-fine grind. ### Turkish coffee preparation (one cup): Pour water into a small Turkish coffee cup called a fincan (about 1.7oz) and dispense it into a small brass cezve coffee pot.![Pour water into cup](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/traditional-turkish-11.DGWecZ9t_ZHPd3x.webp)_Pour Water into a Turkish Coffee Cup_ Add two teaspoons of Turkish coffee.

Empty the cup just prior to pouring in the coffee. On a small flame, stir for about one minute. Then, without stirring, let the coffee come to a boil. This should take 3-4 minutes.![Let coffee boil](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/traditional-turkish-4.afZ1voSr_Z70MHs.webp)_Let coffee boil_ Pour the coffee into the fincan in one swift movement so that all the foam is smoothly transferred.![Pour the coffee into the fincan](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/traditional-turkish-5.BfXEt4MI_TIFTn.webp)_Pour the coffee into the fincan_ Serve with a small cup of fresh water (as traditionally done in Turkey).![Serve Turkish Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/traditional-turkish-6.5V_ecjNa_Z1zNhiR.webp)_Serve Turkish Coffee_ Take a small sip of water to clear the palate and then, once the coffee grinds have sunk to the bottom, little by little, drink the coffee. Don’t drink the grinds at the bottom. These may be used to tell your future. When you have finished your coffee, turn the cup over. Wait a few moments to let the formed coffee patterns to solid and then take a stab at fortune-telling. ### Resources [Coffee Fortune Telling With a Turkish Coffee Pot](https://ineedcoffee.com/coffee-fortune-telling-with-a-turkish-coffee-pot/) – Fortune telling with Turkish Coffee.
