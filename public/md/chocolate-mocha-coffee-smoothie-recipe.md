Published on May 26, 2016--- #### Karen Lopez [Follow Karen Lopez on X](https://x.com/uroastitcoffee)Coffee is in my family as my Grandfather, Keble Munn, was a pioneer in Jamaica with Jamaican Blue Mountain Coffee. He owned Mavis Bank Central Factory and was well-respected in the community. The facility is the largest and only fully integrated facility in Jamaica. I grew up visiting the factory, seeing the process of making the coffee and always knew that I wanted to end up in the coffee industry.It has come late in life with an online store selling green coffee beans.
