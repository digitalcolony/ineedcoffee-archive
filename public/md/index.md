## ☕ INeedCoffee Archived INeedCoffee is now an archive. INeedCoffee is wrapping up after over 25 years online, with its full archive remaining available. Launched in April 1999, INeedCoffee has spent over two decades celebrating coffee culture—from home brewing techniques to the rich history of coffee itself. Over the years, it became a gathering place for coffee enthusiasts to share knowledge, tips, and experiences. As of May 2025, INeedCoffee will no longer publish new content. However, the full archive will remain online—for coffee lovers new and old to enjoy. All 631 articles written by 166 contributors. Thank you to everyone who visited, contributed, and shared a cup with us—virtually or otherwise. Your enthusiasm made this site what it was.![INeedCoffee Logo](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/ineedcoffee-smile.jpg) Michael Allen Smith Founder, INeedCoffee
