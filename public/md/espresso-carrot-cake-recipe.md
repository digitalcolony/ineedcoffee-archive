If you do have a food processor, you can chop the pecans with a knife and the carrots with a carrot grater. Place them on the side. Mix all of the dry ingredients in a large bowl. Set that to the side.![dry ingredients](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/add-espresso-cake.BSkztK_g_2f9Ftd.webp) Pull the shot of espresso (you can use an espresso machine, an AeroPress, or any other method of making espresso). Move that to the side.![pull aeropress shot](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/aeropress-for-cake.NqXpbVDb_1wIcFr.webp) Oil and lightly flour your cake pan. Place it over to the side. Preheat the oven to 350°F. In a mixing bowl, beat the eggs and add the espresso. Add the oil and egg mixture to the dry ingredients, then mix in the carrots. Use your electric mixer on medium speed to blend well. When this is well blended, set the electric mixer aside. Use a spoon to fold in the pecan nuts and raisins. If you do not like raisins, you can leave them out.![Espresso Carrot Cake Mixed](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/espresso-carrot-cake-mixed.By1kHfLU_2bECeJ.webp) Pour the cake batter into the cake pan. Place the pan in the oven and bake for 1 hour. Each oven is different, so be sure to monitor it in case it finishes quicker or needs extra time.![espresso cake pan](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/espresso-cake-pan.DbSXvC2w_Z1bPdYP.webp) ### Prepare the frosting Put two cups of powdered sugar into a mixing bowl. Open the package of cream cheese, then cut it into cubes. You can soften the cheese by putting it into a microwave oven for a minute on high heat. If you do not own a microwave oven, you can just leave the cream cheese out of the fridge for a while instead. Blend the softened cream cheese with powdered sugar and add the vanilla. Use the electric mixer to make the frosting smooth. Once this half of the frosting is well blended, add two more cups of powdered sugar. ### Finishing the Cake Let the cake cool down for at least ten minutes after baking. Once the cake has cooled, add the frosting and enjoy.![espresso carrot cake](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/espresso-carrot-cake.B2WHlCRr_Z1DQg46.webp) ### Resources [Making Lattes Without an Espresso Machine](https://ineedcoffee.com/making-lattes-without-espresso-machine/) – Use your AeroPress to make an “espresso-like” shot.
