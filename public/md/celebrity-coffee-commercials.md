# Celebrity Coffee Commercials [Coffee History](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/coffee-history/)---by [Sue Zeger](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/sue-zeger/)![Celebrity Coffee Commercials](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/celebrity-coffee-commercials/Celebrity-Coffee-Commercials.jpg) Recently, I was feeling a little nostalgic and trying to remember the jingle from the Chock full o’ Nuts coffee commercial from the 1970s. My mom used to add coffee to my milk when I was a kid because I loved the taste so much. My love affair with coffee still continues today. I love the taste, and in moderation, I love how it makes me feel. Thanks to YouTube, I was able to find the Chock full o’ Nuts “Heavenly Coffee” jingle as well as a bunch of unusual, sexist, and entertaining coffee commercials featuring various celebrities, across several decades, and shot in different countries._[Chock full o’Nuts 23rd St. Store Front Loop Proof](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nraL2Gwtc8A)_ This is a commercial for Instant Maxwell House with Andy Griffith and Ron Howard from the 1960s. This reminded me of a time when there were only seven channels to watch. “The Andy Griffith Show” was one of my regular programs, but mostly because there was nothing else on._[1960s INSTANT COFFEE COMMERCIAL ANDY GRIFFITH](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nsB2JvqYAeI)_ Here’s a sexist Folger’s commercial from the 1970s starring Stephen Collins very early in his acting career. Quite the different persona from his “Seventh Heaven” t.v. show from the 90’s._[Folger’s coffee commercial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ed3vswxJKgI&#x26;ab_channel=sideshowcarny)_ This 1970’s commercial for MJB coffee, a regional brand, features a young Teri Garr. She gave entertainment value to an otherwise incredibly boring commercial._[Teri Garr doing a Coffee Commercial – 1970s!!!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpvMmlxhonk&#x26;ab_channel=videoholic50s60s70s)_ Here’s a youthful Scott Bakula for Decaffeinated (ugh!) Folger’s coffee. I’m hoping that he was able to “Quantum Leap” to a real cup of coffee after shooting this commercial._[Scott Bakula Folgers Coffee Commercial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1CCJLMusQw&#x26;ab_channel=TELEVISIONARCHIVES)_ A refined Edward G. Robinson added his cache to this Instant Maxwell House commercial._[EDWARD G ROBINSON – VINTAGE MAXWELL HOUSE COFFEE COMMERCIAL](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3CBiecHDN8&#x26;ab_channel=TVTOYMEMORIES)_ These celebrity coffee commercials were shot in other countries, where well-known American actors could hopefully avoid public scrutiny and potential nicks to their careers. Paul Newman for Maxwell House (Japan)_[Maxwell House Commercial Paul Newman 1980](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_LqYMkl2ga8&#x26;feature=youtu.be&#x26;ab_channel=BrettYoches)_ Tommy Lee Jones for Boss Coffee (Japan)_[Ping Pong Master Tommy Lee Jones Boss Coffee Commercial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U88TkYKFJCo&#x26;ab_channel=358aaa)_ George Clooney and John Malkovich for Nespresso (Switzerland/France)_[Nespresso Taxi Driver John Malkovich George Clooney](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3c7IBW48dM)_ The road to stardom for many successful actors seems to have been paved with hard work, humbling resume-building jobs, and lots of coffee grinds! YouTube surfing down memory lane satisfied my nostalgia, cured my mental block for the “Heavenly Coffee” jingle, and provided me with a small cup o’ caffeinated entertainment.
