Watch the twinkling stars in the velvet sky, and see if all is not well as the night drifts by.![coffee fire](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/coffeefire1.DDGr3Yq__1WTwDu.webp) ### Campfire & Brew Campfire twigs grudgingly hiss and spit, as they flick indignant sparks into the chilly dawn. And my coffee brews. It chortles, and flippantly twirls its steamy tendrils into the crisp, mountain morning. I pour, from tin pot to tin cup, and sup. Life is good.
