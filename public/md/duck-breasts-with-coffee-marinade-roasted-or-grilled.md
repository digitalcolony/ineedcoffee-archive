Brew 12 ounces of coffee; set aside. Mix 6 ounces brewed coffee, 3 ounces dark rum and 3 ounces spiced rum in a re-sealable plastic bag. 2. Combine Rub ingredients in a medium mixing bowl. With a sharp knife, score the duck breast skin. Place into the marinade. MARINATE for 8-12 hours. 3. Once the duck has marinated; remove it from the marinade discarding the liquid. Roll breasts in the rub mixture and then place skin side up in the roasting pan and cover with a lid. Roast at 175℉ for one hour. After one (1) hour, remove the roasting pan from the oven and let the duck rest; covered. 4. Combine all sauce ingredients in a medium saucepan, bring to a boil, and then turn the heat to a simmer. Reduce the sauce by half, stirring often. 5. Remove breasts from the roasting pan. Strain drippings from the roasting pan through a sieve into your sauce ingredients pan. Reduce the sauce with drippings by half, stirring often. 6.

Remove breasts from saute pan and place on a bed of Wild Rice Pilaf. Drizzle sauce mixture over each breast just before serving with fresh steamed asparagus or a vegetable medley. ### (option 2) Grill Prepare the grill for direct and indirect cooking/medium heat (350°F-450°F), grill the duck breasts, skin side down first, over direct medium heat, with the lid closed, until the skin is browned and the meat is cooked to your desired doneness, 8-10 minutes for medium-rare, turning once (if flare-ups occur, move the breasts temporarily over indirect heat). Be careful not to overcook the breast. Remove from the grill and let the duck rest. Or for clearer doneness, grill the duck for 5-7 minutes or until a meat thermometer registers 145°F-150°F. for medium doneness. Serve as desired. Published on November 10, 2010--- #### J.B.
