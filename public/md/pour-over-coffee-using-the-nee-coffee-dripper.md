# Pour Over Coffee Using the Nee Coffee Dripper [Brewing Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/brewing-coffee/)---by [Michael Allen Smith](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/michael-allen-smith/)![Pour Over Coffee Using the Nee Coffee Dripper](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/pour-over-coffee-using-the-nee-coffee-dripper/nee-water-weigh.jpg) The Nee Coffee Dripper is a porcelain manual coffee brewer. This brewer might be right if you want a simple way to make a single cup of coffee. To make pour-over coffee, you will need a kettle to heat water and a #2 size paper filter. I also recommend a kitchen scale to weigh the coffee and the water. If you don’t have a scale, don’t be concerned; you can still make a great cup of coffee with the Nee Coffee Dripper. ### #1 Heat Water and Insert Filter Heat enough water for a cup of coffee and some extra to rinse the filter. Place the #2 filter inside the Nee Coffee Dripper.![Add filter to Nee Dripper](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/nee-filter-624x650.DavHfG9G_ekPTW.webp) ### #2 Rinse Filter (optional) You can rinse the filter before brewing. Most coffee professionals advise doing this step, which removes any paper residue taste and also preheats the porcelain dripper. But you don’t have to. Feel free to skip this step if you can’t detect paper taste in a non-rinsed filter. ### #3 Add Ground Coffee For pour-over coffee, I am using a [medium drip grind](https://ineedcoffee.com/coffee-grind-chart/). How strong or weak you like your coffee is up to you. I start with a 17 to 1 ratio. That means 17 grams of water per 1 gram of coffee. I shared this rule in the [Coffee Sock article](https://ineedcoffee.com/brewing-coffee-coffee-sock/), which applies here. - A 12-ounce mug of coffee is 340 grams. - Divide 340 by 17, and you get 20 grams of coffee. - That little scoop that comes in a can of coffee holds 10 grams. - So two scoops per 12-ounce mug. - If you have a 16-ounce mug, add another 1/2 a scoop. - If you have an 8-ounce mug, subtract 1/2 a scoop.![coffee scoop](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/scoop.CqYrJKEh_1iBuc6.webp) ### #4 Add Hot Water Bring water to a boil and let it cool for 10-30 seconds. Then slowly pour enough water to cover the grounds and let them bloom. Wait 30 seconds, and then resume pouring the hot water over the grounds. If you are using a scale, knowing when to stop adding water will be easy. If you aren’t, pausing and lifting the Nee Dripper to see how much coffee has passed into the mug is OK. Just be careful not to overfill the mug.![nee-water-weigh](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/nee-water-weigh-650x568.Dp4oKdPv_xdJBT.webp) ### #5 Serve Lift off the Nee Dripper and serve. Cleanup is nothing more than removing the filter and a quick rinse of the brewer.![nee-finished-brew](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/nee-finished-brew-650x519.CHFxcKIP_1pm1Kt.webp) There you go—a simple way to make a single cup pour-over at home._Disclosure: INeedCoffee received a Nee Coffee Dripper from Nee Coffee to complete this tutorial._ Published on June 19, 2015--- #### Michael Allen Smith Michael Allen Smith is both a coffee fanatic and a web developer.
