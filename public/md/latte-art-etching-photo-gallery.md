# Latte Art Etching Photo Gallery [Brewing Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/brewing-coffee/)---by [Michael Allen Smith](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/michael-allen-smith/) The following photographs of Latte Art Etching were taken over the course of three visits to Dubsea Coffee in White Center, Washington, just south of Seattle. The etching was done by barista and artist Joerael Julian Elliott. He no longer works there. I’m glad I brought my camera during my visits. Feel free to use any image on this page for any purpose. Even commercial. I only ask that you link to [INeedCoffee](https://ineedcoffee.com).
