However, you can try brewing another batch with the same sock.![Simplified Cold Coffee Brewing Method](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/making-coffee-t1.oTsb4Dm__Z1SQri3.webp)_Simplified Cold Coffee Brewing Method_### Resources [Cold Brew Coffee with the Toddy Coffee Maker](https://ineedcoffee.com/cold-brew-coffee-with-the-toddy-coffee-maker/) – Tutorial on brewing with the Toddy brewer.
