# Chocolate Espresso Cookies and Viennese Coffee [Recipes](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/coffee-recipes/)---by [Wen Zientek-Sico](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/wen-zientek-sico/)![Chocolate Espresso Cookies and Viennese Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/chocolate-espresso-cookies-and-viennese-coffee/cookies_250x2501.jpg) Deep dense chocolate and coffee combined in a rich cookie. What could possibly be better? My coffee-loving recipes testers could not decide which were better – the cookies with the smoother flavor of the crushed beans or the ones with the more assertive coarsely chopped beans. So try both versions! Any type of chocolate – milk, bittersweet, German, white, semisweet…can be used to glaze these cookies with great results. These cookies store very well and are also very sturdy – making them great for gift giving or taking to parties or the office.![Chocolate Espresso Cookies](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/cookies_250x2501.B5BPZQmX_ZPm9D0.webp)_Chocolate Espresso Cookies_### Ingredients - 1/2 cup butter - 4 ounces unsweetened chocolate - 1/2 cup crushed or chopped chocolate-covered espresso beans, divided - 4 eggs - 2 cups sugar - 2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract - 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour - 1/2 cup cocoa powder (measured, then stirred or sifted) - 2 teaspoons baking powder - 1/2 teaspoon salt - 1 cup bittersweet chocolate (or favorite chocolate) ### Directions Melt the butter and unsweetened chocolate in a small heavy saucepan over low heat. Add two tablespoons of the espresso beans and mix until smooth. Cool to room temperature. In a large bowl beat the eggs, sugar, and vanilla until thick and lemon-colored, about five minutes. Mix in the chocolate mixture. Sift in the flour, cocoa, baking powder, and salt and mix until just barely incorporated. Do not overmix. Chill the dough for 1-2 hours. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Line heavy baking sheets with aluminum foil (shiny side up) or parchment paper. Using slightly wet hands, roll the cookies into golf ball sized balls and place 2 inches apart on the prepared cookie sheet. Bake for 10-12 minutes, or until the cookies are firm on the edges. They should still be soft and brownie-like in the center. Cool the cookies on the sheet for five minutes, and then remove to a cooling rack to finish cooling. Melt the bittersweet chocolate until smooth. Glaze each cookie with the melted chocolate and sprinkle with the remaining espresso beans. Let dry thoroughly before storing in an airtight container. Makes about 3 dozen cookies.
