# Double Shot 3.0 – A Portable French Press with Secret Storage [Brewing Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/brewing-coffee/)---by [Michael Allen Smith](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/michael-allen-smith/)![Double Shot 3.0 – A Portable French Press with Secret Storage](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/double-shot-3-0-a-portable-french-press-with-secret-storage/double-shot-french-press-ravel.jpg) I recently received a Double Shot 3.0 French Press from Planetary Design. This updated portable French Press uses the same Bru Stop technology they added to their Tabletop French Press line, which we covered in the article  [French Press Tabletop Coffee and Tea Maker with Bru Stop Technology Review](https://ineedcoffee.com/table-top-press-pot-review/). For over a decade, I made French Press coffee about three times daily. It was an earlier time when the filters did a poor job of keeping the coffee grounds separate from the coffee once the brewing period was complete. Because of this, immediately after brewing, I would always transfer all the coffee brewed directly into a mug or some form of thermal container. It was an extra step, but if I didn’t take that step, the coffee that remained in the French Press would continue brewing at a slow rate. The coffee would become over-extracted and undrinkable.![Double Shot French Press](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/double-shot-french-press.DZi2qEx__ZdBDud.webp)_Double Shot 3.0 French Press Travel Mug_### Bru Stop Filter With traditional filters, it is easy to over-extract French Press coffee if you leave it in the brewer for too long. The Bru Stop filter solved that problem. It is a tighter filter that does a superior job of trapping the ground coffee at the end of the brew cycle. As bad as the over-extraction problem was with counter-top French Press brewers, there was a worse problem with travel French Presses. Coffee grounds easily escaped from the bottom into your brew. How often do French press drinkers using travel models sip coffee with loose coffee grounds? Too many. The good news is the Double Shot 3.0 uses the same Bru Stop filter, so the risk of loose grounds has been greatly reduced. Although I didn’t experience any loose grounds, I hesitate to say the potential has been eliminated, because travel mugs by their very nature get bumped around more than a counter-top French Press. Just do your best job avoiding potholes on your commute and you should be fine.![Bru Stop Filter - French Press Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/double-shot-bru-stop.L-8lk55j_Z27vBJm.webp)_The Bru Stop filter for the Double Shot 3.0._  ### Secret Storage When I first looked into the Double Shot, it seemed rather shallow compared to what I was holding. That is when I figured out the base is detachable. When you screw off the base, you have a secret storage container, which is perfect for storing more coffee. Brilliant! Back in the day, I used to bring a French Press and a Tupperware container with additional coffee into the office. If I didn’t grab the Tupperware, I wouldn’t get afternoon coffee. With the Double Shot, you add the extra coffee into the base while making the first French Press.![Double Shot French Press Storage](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/doubel-shot-coffee-storage.Br5rWDsC_Z18YuIl.webp)_The secret storage for the Double Shot 3.0._### Holds Heat and Doesn’t Spill A travel French Press or any travel mug must excel at holding heat, especially for those living in cold areas—campers and hikers. The Double Shot 3.0, like the Tabletop model, uses a stainless steel interior and vacuum insulation to keep the beverage warm. The lid is solid as well. I had no spillage or leaks during my tests. ### Overview If you want a travel French Press, the Double Shot 3.0 by Planetary Design is an excellent choice. It will hold the heat, keep the loose grounds out of your brew, and even provide a way to carry extra coffee for your next brew. This is also a perfect travel mug for loose-leaf tea drinkers, especially those who use teas that can withstand multiple steeps. ### Resources [French Press Tabletop Coffee and Tea Maker with Bru Stop Technology Review](https://ineedcoffee.com/table-top-press-pot-review/) – Overview of their countertop model.
