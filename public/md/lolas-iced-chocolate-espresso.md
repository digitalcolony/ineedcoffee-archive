# Lola’s Iced Chocolate Espresso [Recipes](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/coffee-recipes/)---by [Lola Low](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/lola-low/)![Lola’s Iced Chocolate Espresso](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/lolas-iced-chocolate-espresso/Iced-Chocolate-Espresso.jpg) So here I am, back again with another syrup recipe, I have conjured up over the summer months. My love for coffee syrups has grown and grown, and so has my bank of recipes. Here is one that I thought you might enjoy. This is a personal favorite for a mid-morning pick-me-up. My early mornings are spent in commuter traffic, horns non-stop and cars bumper to bumper. When I finally arrive at work, I am confronted with a large pile of posts to open and five tasks on my desk to be completed by lunchtime. So by the time 11 o’ clock strikes, I am first to the kitchen to make my creation. I don’t always remember the ice, but cold milk alone is better than no iced chocolate espresso at all.![Iced Chocolate Espresso](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/iced-espresso-monin1.pwOTzFLV_Z27esPU.webp)_Iced Chocolate Espresso_ Here is how to make my iced chocolate espresso: ### You will need: - 1 or 2 shots of espresso (Depending on how strong you like it, I prefer 2) - Cold milk (Again, the amount depends on how milky you like your coffee) - Monin chocolate coffee syrup - Whipped cream - Chocolate dust/sprinkles - Ice ### Directions: 1. Fill your glass with ice 2. Add cold milk 3. Stir in your shot/s of espresso and one teaspoon of chocolate syrup 4. Top with whipped cream and chocolate dust/sprinkles The beauty of this creation is that you can make the drink as strong or weak as you like. If you are a die-hard espresso fan, opt for more espresso shots and just a dash of milk. If you prefer your coffee weak, opt for more milk than coffee.![Iced Chocolate Espresso with Whipped Cream](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/iced-espresso-whipped-cream-cinnamon.BSkkh9FH_10wpum.webp)_Iced Chocolate Espresso with Whipped Cream_ This is my latest coffee syrup addiction and is a perfect pick-me-up with a sweet kick. Since joining Cafe Rico in June I have created several recipes, which I like to share with my fellow coffee enthusiasts. I still love my cinnamon syrup iced coffee, but have been trying out new syrups regularly to spice things up. I decided I needed to make something with a bit of a kick to help me through the morning. Lots of Monin coffee syrups are available, including almond, amaretto, white chocolate, and mint. I used to hate coffee until I started working for a wholesale coffee supplier and decided it was time to confront my coffee fears. If you like mochas, you’ll love my iced chocolate espresso. I haven’t looked back, but I will post more of my recipes soon! ### Resources [Lola’s Cinnamon Syrup Iced Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/lolas-cinnamon-syrup-iced-coffee/) – Another coffee recipe.
