These fluffy discs are a quick and easy food option that tastes great. But, having the same kind of flavorings day after day may make even fun food preparations, such as pancakes, boring and mundane too… Adding a variety of toppings may add an element of surprise, but creating a variation in the pancake recipe sounds more, doesn’t it? And, how about combining the two most loved breakfast preparations in one? We are talking about coffee and pancakes.![coffee pancakes](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/10-coffee-pancakes.ytuaNFUA_1t1r1C.webp) For this recipe, you simply need freshly ground coffee beans to add maximum aroma to your preparation, apart from basic pancake ingredients.
