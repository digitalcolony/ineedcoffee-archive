Recently, I was reminded of family memories from the 1980s of chicory in coffee. I was curious about the role of chicory in coffee, so after doing some research within our family, I learned we drank a blend of 70% Arabica and 30% roasted chicory. Today, 40 years later, I decided to recreate the taste of my family’s coffee and chicory blend. This time I wanted to start from scratch using freshly grown chicory from our own backyard. Roasted Chicory coffee tastes similar to coffee but has a flavor that’s commonly described as slightly nutty or woody, depending on the plant variety, there can be a predominant bitter taste. When roasted Arabica coffee is mixed with Chicory in a cup taste proportion of 70:30 it tastes as close as possible to the smell of roasted coffee. ### What is Chicory? The Plant Variety I used is “Spadona Chicory”, which is botanically classified as “Cichorium intybus”. The leaves are used raw in salads or cooked as a vegetable. The root can be roasted and used as a coffee substitute in a blend. Both have a bitter taste. It takes around 2-1/2 months for the root to be fully formed and requires adequate water twice a week.![chicory fresh](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/Chicory-1.BX4j1tcI_L1OGL.webp)![chicory plant](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/chicory-plant.XV2l5qdi_1nuLcU.webp) ### #1 Remove the Roots and Wash the Plant After 2-1/2 months, uproot the plant and remove the roots, carefully wash the roots until the surface of the root is smooth. Then dry the roots in the sun for a day to remove the moisture contents. One plant will give around 100 grams of roasted chicory, sufficient for 7 cups of coffee, each cup will require approximately 10 to 15 grams of roasted chicory powder.![chicory trimmed](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/Chicory-2.CnOns-Eo_Z1uIUhR.webp)![prep chicory](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/Chicory-3.D_PdPuZ__ZTTkT2.webp) ### #2 Slice the Chicory Root and Sun-Dry The next day cut the dried roots into thick 5mm slices and sun-dry them a full day to get rid of any remaining moisture.![sliced chicory](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/Chicory-4.CBYxSH7-_ZpfhYx.webp) ### #3 Roast the Chicory Place the sliced and dried chicory root on a baking tray with a sheet of baking paper. Roast the dried roots in a preheated oven at 220°F for 30 minutes. Watch the roots closely, as they may burn due to their quality or moisture content. After 30 minutes, turn down the temperature to 180°F and roast for another 10 to 15 minutes. The root slices will have a dark brown color. There may be a few slices underdone but not a worry. Remove the roasted chicory slices and let them cool down.![Chicory prepped](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/Chicory-5.CoENxwJc_2g8Y7a.webp)![roasted chicory](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/Chicory-6.B1QJnPnp_11O0He.webp)![chicory ready](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/Chicory-7.BZL6SkHm_Z15qIMv.webp) ### #4 Grind the Chicory Use a Coffee grinder or a Mortar & Pestle to grind the roasted chicory root to a fine medium coarse powder.![mortar pestle for coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/Chicory-8.b8dQGW1t_1xt7mh.webp) ### #5 Grind the Coffee Grind the medium-roasted Arabica coffee beans to a coarse grind and add a bit more to a fine powder.![coffee grind size](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/Chicory-9.LoZcmfr-_2yrB4.webp) ### #6 Blend the Chicory with the Coffee Use a stainless steel filter coffee drip-over method or a pour-over filter method to brew the coffee.
