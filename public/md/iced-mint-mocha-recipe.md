# Iced Mint Mocha Recipe [Recipes](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/coffee-recipes/)---by [Lola Low](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/lola-low/)![Iced Mint Mocha Recipe](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/iced-mint-mocha-recipe/choc-iced-mint-mocha1.jpg) So here is something a little different from my wonderful selection of coffee syrup recipes. This is a refreshing beverage, perfect for a hot day or if you fancy something a little different from your average cup of coffee. I discovered this fantastic creation after buying some chocolate mint syrup and delving into my freezer to find some ice cream to complement the syrup nicely. A bit of ice, a blender, and an espresso coffee maker, together with the usual milk and coffee, and the Iced Mint Mocha was born. Here is what you need to make the Iced Mint Mocha: - Plenty of ice - 1 teaspoon of Monin mint chocolate coffee syrup - 2 scoops of mint choc chip ice cream - 1 or 2 espresso shots - Cold milk - Whipped cream - Chocolate dust/sprinkles![iced mint mocha](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/choc-iced-mint-mocha1.FsHTEQT5_1gag6o.webp)_Iced Mint Mocha_ You will also need a blender and, ideally, an espresso maker for this creation. ### Directions 1. Put a handful of ice into a blender 2. Add two scoops of mint choc chip ice cream 3. Add one teaspoon of chocolate mint-flavoured coffee syrup 4. Pour in a preferred amount of cold milk (depending on how thick you want it) and 1-2 shots of espresso (depending on how strong you like it) 5. Blend for one minute 6. Pour into a glass and top with whipped cream and chocolate dust/sprinkles or a drizzle of chocolate mint syrup. The Iced Mint Mocha is now my favourite. The refreshing mint and the sweet chocolate make this iced coffee espresso drink a light combo. This is also good as a sundae-style dessert, just add less milk so the mixture is really thick, and then top with whipped cream, chocolate sprinkles, and a drizzle of chocolate mint syrup. Coffee syrups are available in a variety of flavours including almond, hazelnut, vanilla, and white chocolate. My coffee syrup addiction has continued ever since I started working for a coffee supplier, and Iâ€™m not willing to go cold turkey until I have created as many inspiring recipes as possible.
