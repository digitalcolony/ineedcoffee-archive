# Tres Leches Latte or is it Tre Lattes Latte? [Recipes](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/coffee-recipes/)---by [Holland Morgan](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/holland-morgan/)![Tres Leches Latte or is it Tre Lattes Latte?](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/tres-leches-latte-or-is-it-tre-lattes-latte/tre-leches-latte1.jpg) I recently made a Tres Leches cake for my blog. For those not familiar with Tres Leches, it is a dense sponge cake that has been soaked in a syrupy mixture of evaporated milk, sweetened condensed milk, and heavy cream, hence the name Tres Leches (three kinds of milk). The cake is then topped with whipped cream making it a decadent Latin-American treat. When making this cake it is always assured that you will have leftover milk syrup. Instead of dumping it down the sink, I thought, “why not make coffee with it?” The result was spectacular!![Tres Leches Latte](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/tre-leches-latte1.QYS_gvL3_o9rKn.webp)_Tres Leches Latte_### A Tre Latte Latte! (Italian for Tres Leches Latte) The Tres Leches milk syrup is roughly two parts evaporated milk, two parts sweetened condensed milk, and 1 part heavy cream. Since you will surely want to share it with your friends, the easiest recipe is as follows. Stir together: - 1-14 oz can of evaporated milk - 1-14 oz can of sweetened condensed milk - 1 cup heavy cream For my latte, I started with a 4 oz espresso. Steam: 5 oz milk, 3 oz Tres Leches syrup, and 1/4 tsp vanilla extract. For the really cool layered look first: put the milk in the cup, wait until it’s settled, and then add the espresso very slowly. It will automatically separate. Don’t even try to count the calories! Just enjoy!![Layered Latte](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/layered-latte.DK4zmBPN_Z1IhHJK.webp)_Layered Latte_ Published on June 1, 2009--- #### Holland Morgan Holland Morgan is a professional chef specializing in fine dining.
