If you follow the instructions carefully, a black forest coffee can be prepared in very little time. ### What Will I Need?

(This recipe works best with freshly ground coffee.)**Step 1:** If using a French press (as in these illustrations), first crush 150g of maraschino cherries, removing stones as you go.![mix bowl](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/mix-bowl.DeJQuzX3_Zenh8o.webp)_Crush Cherries_**Step 2:** Brew your favourite coffee using your preferred method (we recommend a French press).**Step 3:** Mix coffee and syrup. Wait a few seconds and then, if using a French press, add the cherries. It is important to add the cherries last; this is so you don’t impair the delicate flavouring. Press the filter down now, removing the coffee grounds and cherry solids from the drink. If you’re not using a French press, simply add cherry juice.![8 cup press pot](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/8-cup-press-pot.CRfDL1aZ_ZY4dXV.webp)_La Cafetiere Optima 8-Cup Coffee Press_**Step 4:** Stir well to ensure all the flavours are blended evenly.
