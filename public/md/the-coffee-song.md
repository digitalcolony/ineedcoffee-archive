# The Coffee Song [Coffee People](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/coffee-people/)---by [Michael Allen Smith](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/michael-allen-smith/) I thought I was a Frank Sinatra fan, but somehow, this tune escaped me. Back in 1946, Frank Sinatra sang _The Coffee Song_. Bob Hilliard wrote the lyrics and Dick Miles did the music.**The Coffee Song as performed by Frank Sinatra.**> Way down among Brazilians Coffee beans grow by the billions So they’ve got to find those extra cups to fill They’ve got an awful lot of coffee in Brazil You can’t get cherry soda ’cause they’ve got to sell their quota And the way things are I’ll bet they never will They’ve got a zillion tons of coffee in Brazil No tea or tomato juice You’ll see no potato juice Cause the planters down in Santos all say no no no A politician’s daughter was accused of drinking water And was fined a great big fifty dollar bill They’ve got an awful lot of coffee in Brazil And when their ham and eggs need savor Coffee ketchup gives ’em flavor Coffee pickles way outsell the dill Why they put coffee in the coffee in Brazil No tea or tomato juice You’ll see no potato juice Cause the planters down in Santos all say no no no So your lead to the local color Serving coffee with a cruller Dunking doesn’t take a lot of skill They’ve got an awful lot of coffee in Brazil Man, they got a gang of coffee in Brazil. Many song lyric databases include the following lines, which were not in the Frank Sinatra version. > You date a girl and find out later she smells just like a percolator Her perfume was made right on the grill Why they could percolate the ocean in Brazil Don’t ask for hot cocoa there They’ll say you’ve gone loco there But say caffeine or coffee bean and they’ll say ay ay ay This song appears on several Frank Sinatra releases.![Frank Sinatra Coffee Song](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/frank-sinatra-coffee-song1.Cy3Lnvkp_113GA9.webp) ### Sources [Bob Hilliard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Hilliard) – Wikipedia page.
