# Coffee Custard Sauce Recipe [Recipes](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/coffee-recipes/)---by [J.B. Bulharowski](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/j-b-bulharowski/)![Coffee Custard Sauce Recipe](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/coffee-custard-sauce-recipe/CoffeeCustardRecipe.jpg) Humble store-bought pound cake slathered with a coffee-infused custard sauce turned out to be the base for a recent elegant dessert. A former work colleague rolls into town periodically, so dealing with time constraints, the sauce was constructed to give the dessert some sophistication. Homemade pound cake, long proven as a base for a wedding cake, is preferred for this task. Unfortunately, there was no time to spare before our guest’s whirlwind visit. Thankfully, a store-bought cake worked as a satisfactory base, and no one was aware of the shortcut taken. The origin of the recipe is questionable, recently I found a similar one on Epicurious.com. I had the recipe for this sauce cut and pasted onto a 3×5″ card. The card was undated, bearing only a brief note stating the sauce was delicious and would have been yummy eaten alone. Definitely a tempting thought! Choose your coffee carefully to achieve the flavor you want, then make this yummy coffee treat to express your own personal taste. Enjoy!![Custard Sauce Dish](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/custard.yZHhA8u__2jbf3N.webp)_Coffee Custard Sauce_## Recipe: Coffee Custard Recipe**Summary**: _Make a coffee-infused custard sauce._#### Ingredients - 3 Large Egg Yolks - 1/8 Cup Sugar (More if you wish it to be quite sweet) - 1 cup Whipping cream - 1 Teaspoon Instant Coffee Powder - 1-1/2 Teaspoons dark roasted coffee beans Coarsely Ground (Optional) - 1-1/2 Teaspoons Kahlua Liqueur (Optional) #### Instructions 1.
