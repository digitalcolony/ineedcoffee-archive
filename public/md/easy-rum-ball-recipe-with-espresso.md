Place a small amount of the batter in your palm and roll it into a ball shape. These rum balls are very rich, so make sure that you make the balls very small. Place a ball into one of the three Ziploc bags that you have prepared for the coating. Zip the bag shut and shake the bag so that the rum ball is thoroughly coated. Remove the rum ball and set it aside.![Rum ball gift box](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/n-gift-single.CAVCvw0z_Jwinj.webp)_Rum ball gift box_![Multiple rum ball gift boxes](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/n-gift.ChHb_0pA_1Qisa6.webp)_Multiple rum ball gift boxes_### Tips Place the coated rum balls on an ungreased cookie sheet covered with wax paper. Let the rum balls breathe for at least an hour before attempting to store/package them. They will mellow over the next few days. They do not need to be refrigerated, but they must be stored in an airtight container. If refrigerated, the coating may need to be reapplied.
