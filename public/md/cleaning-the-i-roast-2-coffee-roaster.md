# Cleaning the I-Roast 2 Coffee Roaster [Roasting Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/roasting-coffee/)---by [Michael Allen Smith](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/michael-allen-smith/)![Cleaning the I-Roast 2 Coffee Roaster](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/cleaning-the-i-roast-2-coffee-roaster/iroast-before-cleaning.jpg) I had delayed cleaning my I-Roast 2 coffee roaster until I noticed about 5% of the beans were still yellow and had not roasted. A seasoned roaster is good, but a home coffee roaster needs to be thoroughly cleaned at a certain point. Although I used an I-Roast 2, the following information applies to the original I-Roast Coffee roaster. Before we go through the cleaning methods, let me break down the I-Roast 2 into its components. From top to bottom: 1. Chaff collector lid – the top part 2. Chaff filter mesh – circular ring under the lid 3. Chaff collector base – fits on top of the roasting pot 4. Glass roasting pot – where the beans go 5. Power base assembly – the guts of the roaster that plugs into the wall The power base assembly (#5) can be cleaned with a paper towel or wet wipe. Nothing more. **Do NOT soak the power base assembly in water or put it in the dishwasher.** The rest of this article will focus on cleaning the other parts (#1-4).![iroast-lid-chaff-parts](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/iroast-lid-chaff-parts1.B2rmStxl_1PeCoi.webp)_From left to right: Chaff collector lid (#1), Chaff collector base (#3), Chaff filter mesh (#2)_![iroast-before-cleaning](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/iroast-before-cleaning.CbtyYMC-_ZstGs8.webp)_The I-Roast 2 glass roasting pot (#4) before the cleaning._ As you can see from the photos, my coffee roaster was a mess. I ended up using three different cleaning methods to bring back the shine. All three methods are valid. Use one or a combination—whatever works. ### #1 Puro Caff or Espresso Machine Cleaner I soaked the parts in a bucket of hot water, poured in some Puro Caff, and waited twenty minutes. With a rag, I was able to get them somewhat clean, but not clean enough. It was time to bring out the big gun. ### #2 Oven Cleaner At this point, I sprayed the parts with an oven cleaner. After letting it sit for 20 minutes, I could remove almost everything. It just needed a tiny bit more cleaning. ### #3 Dishwasher I placed all the parts on the top rack of the dishwasher and ran a cycle. That was all it needed to regain its “almost new” look.![iroast-after-cleaning](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/iroast-after-cleaning.Bm37n7np_1sk2kn.webp)_Almost new! It’s time to start the seasoning process all over._ Having a roaster that is too clean or too dirty is not ideal. The best results come from the middle ground, where the roaster is seasoned. This is why I waited until I started getting uneven roasts before I did the three-stage cleaning. ### Resources [I-Roast 2 Coffee Roasting Guide](https://ineedcoffee.com/roasting-coffee-in-a-popcorn-popper/) – INeedCoffee article by Chris Arnold.
