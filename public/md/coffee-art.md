# Coffee Art – Painting With Brewed Coffee [Cafe Culture](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/cafe-culture/)---by [Andy Saur Angel Sarkela](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/andy-saur-angel-sarkela/)![Coffee Art – Painting With Brewed Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/coffee-art/coffee-art.jpg) Andy and Angel Saur make coffee art. They work entirely in coffee – there are no additives, and it’s 100% pure coffee. Andrew Saur and Angel Sarkela have been painting with coffee for almost a year. At first, they tried several techniques, such as using the coffee bean to sketch with and making pastels out of coffee grounds. Finally, they decided to use the coffee as a watercolor. First, they sketch out an idea, then start brewing a really strong pot of coffee. From there, water is added to gain the subtle tones of brown. Finally, a clear coat of acrylic is added to preserve the art. ### Wildlife![Black bear - Coffee artwork](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/black_bear1.NorPhjMK_Z6rWYy.webp)![polar bear - Coffee artwork](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/polar_bear.Dw-ecfCm_Z1ribcB.webp)![wolf portrait - Coffee artwork](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/wolf_portrait.CfEyy4Nn_ZRTufo.webp)![wolf howling - Coffee artwork](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/wolf_howling.BMxATYKP_1W2i8D.webp)![husky - Coffee artwork](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/bristol.DCMcB7Pt_ZcaTe5.webp)![frog - Coffee artwork](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/frog.DqU_cTzn_P81TC.webp)![loon - Coffee artwork](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/loon.ClQYBh0r_17c7UB.webp)![dragonfly - Coffee artwork](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/dragonfly.zINuvja1_IFCy2.webp) ### Nature![north shore retreat - Coffee artwork](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/north_shore_retreat.jNrW0TUh_ZLGHQk.webp)![waterfall - Coffee artwork](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/waterfall.DAjSfUFQ_Z1AWn61.webp)![witch tree - Coffee artwork](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/witch_tree.BQD9pn3E_E2sXQ.webp)![lighthouse - Coffee artwork](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/lighthouse.ChZtG4z6_Z1lLcea.webp)![lady slipper - Coffee artwork](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/lady_slipper.BVtMr1Cu_kXKt7.webp) ### People![dave matthews - Coffee artwork](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/dave_matthews.bpCiaHZf_Z1Ob50p.webp)![fiddler - Coffee artwork](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/fiddler.CvJBALIj_WcWug.webp)![louis armstrong - Coffee artwork](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/louis_armstrong.leqoPtcw_27l4nr.webp)![john the book binder - Coffee artwork](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/john_the_book_binder.CiYc0XKb_Z1gBAMI.webp) ### Resources [The Coffee Art Corporation](https://ineedcoffee.com/the-coffee-art-corporation/) – INeedCoffee contribution by Ryan L Lewis.
