# Make Your Own Whipped Cream Coffee Drink and Save Money [Recipes](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/coffee-recipes/)---by [Bobby Sumner](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/bobby-sumner/)![Make Your Own Whipped Cream Coffee Drink and Save Money](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/whipped-cream-amazement/whipped-drink1.gif) In working for an office coffee service for the past 14 years, I have been amazed at what customers get so excited about. Very few customers usually get excited over cutting their coffee costs or giving them excellent service. The most exciting thing to them is making that _great cup of Joe_, become something more than ground coffee. Our company is very big on doing taste tests to ensure that the people drinking the coffee will be satisfied for a long time. We will usually do these taste tests in the morning time to help us get a better idea of the majority of the use. You can bring food, gifts, or coffee basket items to them, but nothing excites people like WHIPPED CREAM!![whipped cream drink](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/whipped-drink1.BjUPIoK3_Z1SCaEW.webp)_Whipped Cream Coffee Drink_ One day, I was doing a taste test for a company, and I was making a cup for the person in charge of making the decision for our services. I asked her, **“Would you like a $4 cup of coffee for about $0.10 cents?”** Of course, she said “yes!” I filled her cup first with a bottom layer of caramel syrup, and then I added a half cup of coffee. I then put 1/4 cup of cream on top and when I pulled the whipped cream out, she almost came unglued. > Oh my god!! Whipped cream! I can’t believe it! It is such a treat! I think I was shocked by her behavior more than anything else. She actually jumped up and down and went down the hall to get more people. She told them, “Look, he has whipped cream!” It was like we brought the party to the office. This went on for hours. That was the longest taste test I have ever been on, and we have received a great amount of business due to whipped cream. Try wooing your families and friends with this, and I would love to know your response. Isn’t it funny how the simple things in life make people joyful? Try it at a gathering of friends and family. You will be AMAZED!
