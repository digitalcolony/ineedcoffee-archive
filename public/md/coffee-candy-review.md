# Coffee Candy Review [Cafe Culture](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/cafe-culture/)---by [Rachel Elliot](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/rachel-elliot/)![Coffee Candy Review](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/coffee-candy-review/pocket150x1781.jpg)_**2017 UPDATE:** We have completely updated this article. Check out [A Coffee Drinker’s Guide to Coffee Candies](https://ineedcoffee.com/coffee-drinkers-guide-coffee-candies/)._  As a coffee fanatic, I’ve often sought ways to extend my love of coffee and simultaneously placate my sweet tooth. So, I’ve taken to eating coffee-flavored candy. It is worth noting that there is no such thing as a coffee flavoring that is completely man-made. All coffee flavoring is derived from coffee because the taste of coffee is just too complex to be replicated accurately. But just because it is derived from real coffee **does not** mean that all coffee candy is created equal. ### Pocket Coffee This candy starts with a caramelized sugar pocket for a sweet espresso liquid. The caramelized sugar is coated with European milk chocolate. The manufacturer (Fererro) claims that eating three pieces is equivalent to a shot of espresso, and I have to admit that I got a buzz off of the candy. I brought it to work to share with co-workers. They loved it and asked for more.![Pocket Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/pocket150x1781.CgggYmeC_Z15uaoI.webp)_Review for Pocket Coffee: Fantastic!_### Coffee Rio This candy’s consistency is similar to chewy caramel. It sticks to your molars and tastes like a cup of coffee with lots of cream and sugar. You can purchase it by the bag at specialty grocery stores.![Coffee Rio](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/rio150x127.kH_VOKci_yMidS.webp)_Review for Coffee Rio: Very Good_### Rademaker’s Hopjes This is a little hard candy from Holland. It’s pretty tasty. The coffee flavor is evenly distributed throughout the candy and tastes a little like a Frappuccino. Getting this candy can be a little tricky. I stumbled upon it at a local coffee shop.![Hopjes](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/hopjes150x194.BB-wUBrV_12WY2C.webp)_Review for Rademaker’s Hopjes: Good_### Brach’s Coffee Candy This hard candy smells like coffee and is colored like a cup of weak coffee, but it tastes nothing like coffee. It’s so gross that I spit it out before finishing the piece. You can find it at your local supermarket in Brach’s bulk candy display.![brach 5](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/brach150x113.C_xCJ9Y5_Z1nAYlr.webp)_Review for Brach’s Coffee Candy: Yucky_### Rocket Chocolate This candy is marketed “for adults only” and claims to boost energy like a cup of coffee. It has a gunk-filled center surrounded by low-grade chocolate. It’s lousy; stay away from this brand. Trust me, you don’t want to try this candy, so locating it shouldn’t be a concern.![Rocket Chocolate](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/rocket150x193.CgLrMh6u_1vnvpB.webp)_Review for Rocket Chocolate: Horrible_### Resources [A Coffee Drinker’s Guide to Coffee Candies](https://ineedcoffee.com/coffee-drinkers-guide-coffee-candies/) – Our updated guide to Coffee Candies.
