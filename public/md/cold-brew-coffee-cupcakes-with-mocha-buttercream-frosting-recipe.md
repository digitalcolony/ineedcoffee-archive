# Cold Brew Coffee Cupcakes With Mocha Buttercream Frosting Recipe [Recipes](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/coffee-recipes/)---by [Mark Morphew](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/mark-morphew/)![Cold Brew Coffee Cupcakes With Mocha Buttercream Frosting Recipe](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/cold-brew-coffee-cupcakes-with-mocha-buttercream-frosting-recipe/Cold-Brew-Coffee-Cupcakes-Recipe.jpg) I’ll admit that I have two vices in this world, and both aren’t particularly healthy in large quantities. My name is Mark, and I’m addicted to coffee and cupcakes! I am a HUGE coffee addict, ask anyone and they will tell you that they never see me without a cup of coffee in my hand, damn if I could I would be hooked up 24/7 to a coffee IV drip! So when my wife decided to bake a batch of coffee cupcakes with mocha butterscotch frosting I literally started doing cartwheels; the best of both worlds I thought, and I wasn’t disappointed. For any coffee lover, today is your lucky day, because my wife has been kind enough to share her coffee cupcake recipe with all of you. So wipe that drool from the side of your mouth because this cold brew coffee mocha cupcake recipe is going to get your heart racing. This coffee cupcake recipe is slightly different from others you’ll find scattered all over the web, and the main difference is the use of cold drip coffee in the ingredients. In our house, we often have an Iwaki Cold Drip Brewer in the fridge, so we always have access to fresh cold coffee. But for those of you who don’t have a cold drip or cold brew coffee maker, any leftover coffee from your French Press or even an automatic coffee maker can be used as a substitute. So if you’re ready to get your hands on this awesome mocha coffee cupcake recipe, the wait is over, grab yourself a pen, paper, and a large coffee (to drink not for the recipe) and let’s crack on!![cold brew cupcakes with mocha frosting](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/mocha-cupcakes-0793.Ci3J8KKp_1lONGP.webp) ### How To Make Coffee Cupcakes With Mocha Buttercream Frosting This cupcake recipe is super easy and has everything in it that gives that ‘good’ feeling, in under one hour you’ll have some delicious coffee-infused cupcakes to share with your family and friends. #### Cooking and Preparation Time: Prep: 25 min.
