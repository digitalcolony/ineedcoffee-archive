It is a favorite, delicious indulgence for Cincinnatians. We made an improvement to the original by adding ground coffee.![Chili Spices](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/chili-spices.B7cFCGJ9_20WoMF.webp) ### Overview - Serves 4 - Prep: 10 mins - Cook: 25 mins - Total time: 35 mins![chili veggies](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/chili-veggies.DL5R9DnK_8N1Vb.webp) ### Ingredients - 1, 28 oz can Crushed Fire Roasted Tomatoes - ½ medium White Onion, diced - 1 medium Red Bell Pepper, diced - 3 medium Jalapenos, diced - 4 medium cloves of Garlic, minced - ½ can of Black Beans - ½ can of Pinto Beans - ½ can of Red Kidney Beans - 1 tbsp cooking oil - 3 squares Dark Chocolate (85%) - 1 tbsp Chili Powder - 2 ½ tsp Cumin - 1 ½ tsp Paprika - ½ tsp Coriander - ⅛ tsp Cinnamon - 1 tsp Oregano - ¼ tsp fine Sea Salt - 1 tbsp Molasses - 1 tbsp finely ground medium roast coffee *![chili beans](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/chili-beans.2kx1_zd-_2nrdBa.webp)![chili start](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/chili-start.D1POQIY8_Z1D8rBC.webp) ### Instructions 1.
