My coffee drips invitingly. My current book lies dog-eared at stopping place, from last personal quality time. What else can I do but plump my pillows and climb in? You would too. With hot libation, and mental laxation, peace is mine.![heavenly latte art](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/heavenly-latte1.JMXZcrtO_ZOuYvD.webp)_Latte Art Etching_### Air Freshener Brown bubbles skate across the smooth, scalding surface, and cluster at the lip of the hot mug of dark brew. They jostle each other, and murmur steamy coffee stories. Each anxious to be the first to burst, and flick her rich, pungent scent into the crisp, clean air of early morning.
