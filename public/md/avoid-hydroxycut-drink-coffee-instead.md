# Avoid Hydroxycut, Drink Coffee Instead [Coffee and Health](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/coffee-health/)---by [Michael Allen Smith](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/michael-allen-smith/) On May 1, 2009, the FDA issued a warning on the Hydroxycut supplement line. From the FDA website: Warning on Hydroxycut: > FDA has received 23 reports of serious health problems ranging from jaundice and elevated liver enzymes, an indicator of potential liver injury, to liver damage requiring liver transplant. One death due to liver failure has been reported to the FDA. I thought this supplement would disappear since ephedra was removed as an ingredient in fat loss pills. Although it was one powerful stimulant, ephedra, when combined with caffeine and baby aspirin, was a powerful thermogenic supplement—too powerful for me. I was amazed to see why people still bought an ephedra-free Hydroxycut. I guess dieters will always want a quick fix to their weight problems. After ephedra was removed from Hydroxycut, The Healthy Skeptic went through each ingredient in the supplement to see if it still had any benefit and came to this conclusion. > Hydroxycut is a supplement that combines ingredients with dubious pedigrees with ingredients that _may_ prove to be beneficial in some regard _other_ than weight loss, topped off with stimulants.![Espresso at Neptune Coffee](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/neptune-coffee-espresso1.svmtsjR6_1STOsA.webp)_Espresso at Neptune Coffee_ As a coffee drinker, I always shake my head in disgust at these so-called fat-burning stimulants. Coffee is a tasty, zero-calorie beverage that gives one the energy to go for a run or lift weights. Why is this? According to Dr. Jonny Bowden: > The slight increase in blood sugar from caffeinated coffee is a boon for athletes…who need that blood sugar to fuel their muscles. For years, I’ve slightly increased my morning coffee intake before I go to the gym. I’ll have a bonus espresso about 15 minutes before heading to the gym. It kicks in about the time my warm-up sets are completed. And if I’m too unmotivated to go to the gym, then I deny myself that espresso. Guess what? I rarely miss a workout. ### Resources The Healthy Skeptic: Hydroxycut – Weight Loss Supplement or Myth? – by Sal Marinello _(2017: article no longer online)_[Warning on Hydroxycut](https://web.archive.org/web/20161024065813/http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/PublicHealthFocus/ucm155600.htm) – FDA website [ECA Stack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECA_stack) – Ephedra, Caffeine, Aspirin (Wikipedia) Published on May 1, 2009--- #### Michael Allen Smith Michael Allen Smith is both a coffee fanatic and a web developer.
