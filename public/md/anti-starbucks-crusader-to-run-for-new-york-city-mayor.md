# Anti-Starbucks Crusader To Run For New York City Mayor [Coffee People](https://ineedcoffee.com/section/coffee-people/)---by [Michael Allen Smith](https://ineedcoffee.com/by/michael-allen-smith/)![Anti-Starbucks Crusader To Run For New York City Mayor](https://ineedcoffee.com/images/posts/anti-starbucks-crusader-to-run-for-new-york-city-mayor/rev-billy-anti-starbucks-sermon1.jpg) Bill Talen, who is better known as Reverend Billy, is now running to be the next Mayor of New York City. Some longtime INeedCoffee readers will recall that in 2002, Reverend Billy went after coffee giant Starbucks. He delivered sermons in Manhattan on the _ruthlessness_ of Starbucks Coffee. From _Reverend Billy’s Starbucks Invasion_ by Bill Talen: > When Starbucks’ scouts enter a new neighborhood, they listen for the laughter. They find where culture is still original, not corporatized, and that is their opponent and prey, for Starbucks is a jealous God. They approach the landlords of the community, whether it’s a diner or a restaurant or a bar. They offer far more than the traditional tenant can afford, because Starbucks arrives with its Nasdaq funny money. They arrive from a completely different economy, and evict the business that native residents have built for years. This is a famous Starbucks tactic and has been repeated throughout the country and abroad. It is a kind of bombing. It is violent. READERS. DO I HAVE A WITNESS? STOP THE BOMBING!!![rev billy](https://ineedcoffee.com/assets/rev-billy-anti-starbucks-sermon1.Dulcjsn6_1qu7GM.webp)_[Reverend Billy / What Would Jesus Buy](http://www.flickr.com/photos/canarypromo/422816266/) by Mason Wendell_ Reverend Billy is now going after Wall Street and banking bailouts.

United as he already is with the city’s many communities, his administration will be the connecting force reaching out to all New Yorkers, to create a city that is sustainable, just and free; defending public space, self-determination, and the right for every New Yorker to earn an honest, independent living.
